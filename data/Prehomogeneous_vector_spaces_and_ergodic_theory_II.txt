                                            Introduction

                                               Throughout this paper, k is a field of characteristic zero. In this paper we
                                            consider the following three prehomogeneous vector spaces
                                            (1) G = GL(6), V = ∧3 k 6 ,
                                            (2) G = GL(1) × GL(7), V = ∧3 k 7 ,
                                            (3) G = GL(2n), V = ∧2 k 2n .
                                            For the definition of prehomogeneous vector spaces, see [7], [11], or [10]. The
                                            classification of irreducible regular prehomogeneous vector spaces is known [7].
                                               For any algebraic group G, we denote the connected component of 1 in Zariski
                                            topology by G0 . If G is defined over a subfield of R, we denote the connected
                                            component of 1 of GR in classical topology by G0R+ . Let (G, V ) be one of the
                                            prehomogeneous vector spaces (1)–(3). Let H = SL(n) ⊂ G (n = 6, 7) or H =
                                            SL(2n). For x ∈ Vkss , let Gx be the stabilizer and Hx = Gx ∩ H.
                                                                                          0                     0
                                               Consider the case k = Q. Note that HR+        = HR . Let Γ ⊂ HR+     = HR be an
                                            arithmetic lattice. The second author pointed out in [10], as a consequence of the
                                            Moore ergodicity theorem, that for almost all x ∈ VRss such that HxR  0
                                                                                                                     has positive
                                                                   0
                                            real rank, the set HxR+ Γ is dense in HR . The purpose of this paper is to find
                                            an explicit irrationality condition on x that implies the density of this set, and to

Question (0.5) in [10], for the three prehomogeneous vector spaces that we consider.
   The following theorem is the main result of this paper. In statements (1)–(3)
of the following theorem, we consider the prehomogeneous vector spaces (1)–(3)
respectively. Let W be the standard representation of GL(6), GL(7), or GL(2n).
We identify ∧3 W and ∧2 W with ∧3 (W ∗ )∗ and ∧2 (W ∗ )∗ respectively. We define
the notion of “sufficiently irrational” points in Definition (5.1)(1)–(3).
Theorem (6.15) Suppose x ∈ VRss is sufficiently irrational and the real rank of

for all i < j ≤ 2n − 1.

§1 The orbit space Gk \ Vkss (1)

   We describe the orbit space Gk \ Vkss in §§1,2. We do not need the GL(1)–factor
for cases (1) and (3), because having an extra GL(1)–factor does not change the
orbit space Gk \ Vkss for these cases. Let W be as in the introduction. Throughout
this paper, for a basis {e1 , e2 , · · · } of W , we use the notation ei1 ···ik = ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik .
   For case (3), Gk \ Vkss consists of a single point due to the well known fact that
over any field two symplectic forms are equivalent. Let e1 , · · · , e2n be the standard
coordinate vectors of k 2n . Let w = e1 n+1 + · · · + en 2n . Then Gk \ Vkss = Gk w and
Gw = G0w = Hw = Hw0 = Sp(2n).
   We consider case (1) for the rest of this section. Let G = GL(6), W = k 6 , and
V = ∧3 W . It is known (see [7, p. 80]) that this is a prehomogeneous vector space.
Let {e1 , · · · , e6 } be a basis of W . It is known (see [7]) that the orbit of

(1.1)                                    w = e123 + e456

is Zariski open in V .
   Let
                                                            
                                                      A 0
(1.2)                                d(A, B) =
                                                      0 B

for A, B ∈ M(3, 3). Then

(1.3)      G0w = {d(A, B) | A, B ∈ GL(3), det A = det B = 1} ∼
                                                             = SL(3) × SL(3)

                                                 2
and Gw is generated by G0w and the element
                                          
                                      0 I3
(1.4)                          τ=            .
                                      I3 0

This implies that the following sequence

(1.5)                        1 → G0w → Gw → Z/2Z → 1

which sends τ to the non-trivial element of Z/2Z is exact. Moreover, this exact
sequence is split. For these facts, the reader should see [7]. Note that the argument
in [7] works over any ground field of characteristic zero.
   For any algebraic group G over k, let H1 (k, G) be the first Galois cohomol-
ogy set. We choose the definition so that trivial classes are those of the form
{g −1 g σ }σ∈Gal(k̄/k) (g ∈ Gk̄ ) and the cocycle condition is hστ = hτ hτσ for a continu-
ous map {hσ }σ∈Gal(k̄/k) from Gal(k̄/k) to Gk̄ .
   For x = gw ∈ Vkss where g ∈ Gk̄ , we define cx = {g −1 g σ }σ∈Gal(k̄/k) ∈ H1 (k, Gw ).
This definition does not depend on the choice of g. Since H1 (k, G) = {1}, by [4, p.
269],

(1.6)                      Gk \ Vkss ∋ x → cx ∈ H1 (k, Gw )

is bijective.
   Let Ex2 be the set of isomorphism classes of extensions k ′ /k of degree either one
or two. By the split exact sequence (1.5), we get a surjective map

(1.7)                    αV : Gk \ Vkss → H1 (k, Z/2Z) ∼
                                                       = Ex2 .

For x ∈ Gk \ Vkss , we denote the field corresponding√to αV (x) by k(x). Let k(α) be
the field generated by an element of the form α = β. We define wα = gα w where
                                                         
                                1 0 0         1   0     0
                               α 0 0 −α 0              0 
                                                         
                              0 1 0          0   1     0 
(1.8)                   gα =                             .
                              0 α 0          0 −α 0 
                                                         
                                0 0 1         0   0     1

   Suppose α ∈/ k × and σ is the non-trivial element of Gal(k(α)/k). It is easy to
see that gα = gα τ . This implies that (gα w)σ = gα τ w = gα w. So wα ∈ Vkss and
          σ

k(wα ) = k(α). Easy computations show that

(1.9)                    wα = e123 + α2 (e156 − e246 + e345 ).

   We determine G0wα rationally.

Proposition (1.10) If α ∈

Proof. In order to prove an isomorphism between two algebraic groups G1 , G2 over
k, it is enough to prove natural isomorphisms between the sets G1R , G2R of R–
rational points of G1 , G2 for all k–algebras R. For this, the reader should see
Theorem [6, p. 17].
   Let R be any k–algebra. For any finite Galois extension k ′ /k, ν ∈ Gal(k ′ /k) acts
on k ′ ⊗ R by (x ⊗ r)ν = xν ⊗ r. We define R(α) = k(α) ⊗ R. Then

                          G0wα R = {g ∈ G0wα R(α) | g σ = g}.

  Over R(α), we can express elements of G0wα R as

(1.11)                              gα d(A, B)gα−1,

where A, B ∈ SL(3)R(α) . The element (1.11) is in G0wα R if and only if

                        gα d(A, B)gα−1 = gασ d(Aσ , B σ )(gασ )−1
                                           = gα τ d(Aσ , B σ )τ gα−1
                                           = gα d(B σ , Aσ )gα−1 .

This condition is satisfied if and only if B = Aσ . This proves the proposition. 
  Note that                                                  
                                                   I3
                               gα τ gα−1   =                      .
                                                        −I3
So the sequence
                           1 → G0wα → Gwα → Z/2Z → 1
is also a split exact sequence.
   By Lemma (1.4) [5], H1 (k, G0wα ) is trivial for all α. So by Lemma (1.12) [5], we
get the following proposition.
Proposition (1.12) The map αV induces a bijection Gk \ Vkss ∼      = Ex2 .
   This gives us an interpretation of the expected density theorem from the zeta
function theory of this case and the zeta function is a counting function of

                             Res ζk(α) (s)ζk(α) (2)ζk(α) (3)
                             s=1

for quadratic extensions k(α) (ζk(α) (s) is the Dedekind zeta function). However,
we will not consider the zeta function in this paper. For the zeta function theory
of prehomogeneous vector spaces, see [9], [11].
   If k = R, GR \ VRss is represented by w0 = w and

(1.13)                     w1 = e123 − e156 + e246 − e345 .


  As in [7], we define a map D3 : ∧3 W → ∧2 W ⊗ W by

(1.14)        D3 (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ v3 ) = v2 ∧ v3 ⊗ v1 − v1 ∧ v3 ⊗ v2 + v1 ∧ v2 ⊗ v3

                                               4
for v1 , v2 , v3 ∈ W .
   For x ∈ Vk , we define

(1.15)        Sx = x ∧ D3 (x) ∈ ∧5 W ⊗ W ∼
                                         = W∗ ⊗ W ∼
                                                  = Hom(W, W ),

where x ∧ (y ⊗ z) = (x ∧ y) ⊗ z.
  It is proved in [7, p. 80] that there is a relative invariant polynomial ∆(x) of
degree four such that Sx2 = ∆(x)IW where IW is the identity map of W . This
implies that

(1.16)                          ∆(gx) = (det g)2 ∆(x).

   Since Sw has eigenvalues ±1 (see [7, p. 80]), ∆(w) = 1. Also since ch k = 0
and ∆(w) ∈ k, we may assume that ∆ ∈ k[V ]. Note that det gα = −8α. So
∆(wα ) = 64α2 ∆(w) = 64α2 . Therefore, this gives us the following characterization
of the field k(x).
Proposition (1.17) For x ∈ Vkss , the field k(x) is generated by eigenvalues of Sx .
                                                                          1
   Let Ex1 , Ex2 be the eigenspaces of Sx for the eigenvalues ±∆(x) 2 . It is known
[7] that dim Ex1 = dim Ex2 = 3. Let Gr(3, 6) be the Grassmann of 3–dimensional
subspaces of W . Let

(1.18)                   X = (Z/2Z) \ (Gr(3, 6) × Gr(3, 6)),

where Z/2Z acts by permuting two factors.
Definition (1.19) Gr(x) = ([Ex1 ], [Ex2 ]) ∈ X.
   Since we are assuming ch k = 0, k–rational points of X are points which are set
theoretically fixed by any σ ∈ Gal(k̄/k). If x ∈ Vkss , Ex1 , Ex2 are conjugate. So
Gr(x) is a k–rational point of X. The following proposition is obvious.
Proposition (1.20) If x ∈ Vk̄ss and σ ∈ Gal(k̄/k), Gr(xσ ) = Gr(x)σ .
   For general x ∈ V ss , we cannot distinguish Ex1 and Ex2 . But for later purposes,
we choose Ew1 and Ew2 so that Ew1 is spanned by e1 , e2 , e3 and Ew2 is spanned
by e4 , e5 , e6 . It is proved in [7, p. 80] that Ew1 (resp. Ew2 ) is the eigenspace of Sw
for the eigenvalue 1 (resp. −1).

§2 The orbit space Gk \ Vkss (2)

   We describe the orbit space Gk \ Vkss for case (2) in this section. Since this
case has something to do with octonion algebras, we briefly recall the Cayley–
Dickson process. Octonian algebras are often referred to as Cayley algebras also.
For a reference, see [2, pp. 101–110] for example. Note that even though [2]
assumes k = R, the argument for the Cayley–Dickson process works over any field
of characteristic zero.
Definition (2.1) A normed k–algebra is a not necessarily associative finite di-
mensional k–algebra A with multiplicative unit 1, equipped with a non-degenerate

kxk = hx, xi satisfies the multiplicative property

                                       kxyk = kxkkyk.

   If A is a normed k–algebra, we denote the span of 1 by Re(A) and its orthogonal
complement {x ∈ A | h1, xi = 0} by Im(A). Any x ∈ A has a unique decomposition
x = x1 + x2 with x1 ∈ Re(A), x2 ∈ Im(A). We denote Re(x) = x1 , Im(x) = x2 . We
define the conjugation by x̄ = x1 − x2 . So Re(x) = 21 (x + x̄).
   Given a normed k–algebra A, we make two new normed k–algebras A(±) as
follows. As a vector space,
                                  A(±) = A ⊕ A.
We define the multiplication and the norm by

(2.2)                                            ¯ da + bc̄),
                            (a, b)(c, d) = (ac ∓ db,
                            k(a, b)k = kak ± kbk.

Then we define
                                   1
              h(a, b), (c, d)i =     (k(a, b) + (c, d)k − k(a, b)k − k(c, d)k).
                                   2

The algebra A(±) becomes a normed k–algebra by the above product and             √ the
     √ form. We use the notation a + bǫ for (a, b). Note that if k contains −1,
bilinear
ǫ → −1ǫ induces an isomorphism A(+) → A(−).
   For a normed k–algebra A, we define [x, y, z] = (xy)z−x(yz) for x, y, z ∈ A. This
is called the associator. If the associator is alternating, A is called an alternative
algebra. It is known that if A is commutative, A(±) is associative, and if A is
associative, A(±) is alternative. The above process is called the Cayley–Dickson
process. It is easy to see that

(2.3)                 Im(a + bǫ) = Im(a) − bǫ, a + bǫ = ā − bǫ.

The following lemma is proved in [2].
Lemma (2.4) (1) xy = ȳx̄,
(2) hx, yi = Re(xȳ).
(3) kxk = xx̄.
   If A, B are normed k–algebras, a homomorphism φ : A → B is a k–linear map
such that φ(1) = 1, φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y), and kφ(x)k = kxk. The third condition
implies hφ(x), φ(y)i = hx, yi. So φ(Im(A)) ⊂ Im(B). Suppose x, y ∈ Im(A). Then
hx, yi = Re(xȳ) = −Re(xy). So

           −Re(φ(x)φ(y)) = hφ(x), φ(y)i = hx, yi = −Re(xy),
                 φ(Im(xy)) = φ(xy − Re(xy)) = φ(x)φ(y) − Re(xy)
                             = φ(x)φ(y) − Re(φ(x)φ(y)) = Im(φ(x)φ(y)).

                                               6
Conversely, φ is a homomorphism if the above conditions are satisfied. So we have
proved the following proposition.
Proposition (2.5) A k–linear map φ : A → B is a homomorphism if and only if

             φ(1) = 1, φ(Im(xy)) = Im(φ(x)φ(y)), hφ(x), φ(y)i = hx, yi

for all x, y ∈ Im(A).
   It is easy to see that

                                   2

Proof. Since yz = y1 z1 − z̄2 y2 + (z2 y1 + y2 z̄1 )ǫ,

                         yz = z̄1 ȳ1 − ȳ2 z2 − (z2 y1 + y2 z̄1 )ǫ,
                    x(yz) = x1 (z̄1 ȳ1 − ȳ2 z2 ) + (ȳ1 z̄2 + z1 ȳ2 )x2
                               + (−(z2 y1 + y2 z̄1 )x1 + x2 (y1 z1 − z̄2 y2 ))ǫ.

                                                          7
Therefore,
                 C(x, y, z) = Re(x(yz))
                               = Re(x1 (z̄1 ȳ1 − ȳ2 z2 ) + (ȳ1 z̄2 + z1 ȳ2 )x2 )

                               = tr(x1 (z̄1 ȳ1 − ȳ2 z2 ) + (ȳ1 z̄2 + z1 ȳ2 )x2 ).

following proposition and the proof is left to the reader.
Proposition (2.10) (1) Suppose
                         7
                         X                                                    

                         i=1

Then kxk = −x21 + x2 x5 + x3 x6 + x4 x7 .
(2) C = 21 (e234 + e567 + e125 + e136 + e147 ).
   Let W = Im(O)  e ∗ . We choose the above basis {e1 , · · · , e7 }. Let G = GL(1) ×
GL(W ), V = ∧3 W . The GL(1)–factor acts by the usual multiplication. We need
this factor for number theoretic reasons unlike case (1). It is known [7, p. 83–87]
that this is a prehomogeneous vector space and the orbit of

(2.11)                     w = e234 + e567 + e125 + e136 + e147

is Zariski open.
   We use the operation D3 defined in (1.14) again. For x ∈ V , we define

(2.12)         Sx = x(∧, ⊗)D3 (x)(∧, ⊗)D3 (x) ∈ ∧7 W ⊗ W ⊗ W ∼
                                                             = W ⊗ W,

where (∧, ⊗) means the wedge product for the first factor and the tensor product
for the second factor. Let φ : W ⊗ W → Sym2 W be the canonical map.
Definition (2.13) Qx = φ(Sx ).
   We regard Qx and x as elements of Sym2 (W ∗ )∗ ∼= Sym2 Im(O)e ∗ and ∧3 (W ∗ )∗
                                                   ∗
respectively. So Qx is a quadratic polynomial on W and x is an alternating tri-
linear form on W ∗ . We use the same notation Qx for the associated bilinear form

                                                    8
on W ∗ . We define the action of GL(W ) on W ∗ by gf (v) = f (g −1 v). In this way,
we identify GL(W ) and GL(W ∗ ). Note that if we use bases for W, W ∗ which are
dual to each other and identify GL(W ), GL(W ∗ ) with the set of 7 × 7 matrices,
g ∈ GL(7) corresponds to t g −1 by this identification. It is easy to see that


(2.14)                          Q(t,g)x = t3 (det g)gQx

(we are taking the determinant considering g ∈ GL(W )).
  We used the software “MAPLE” [1] to compute Qx for x = w and

(2.15)                      w′ = e234 + e346 + e127 − e145 .

   For example, to compute Qw′ , we associate a differential form dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4 +· · ·
to w′ and the input is as follows.

  > with(difforms);
  > defform(x1=0,x2=0,x3=0,x4=0,x5=0,x6=0,x7=0);
  > w:= &^(d(x2),d(x3),d(x4))+&^(d(x3),d(x4),d(x6))
    +&^(d(x1),d(x2),d(x7))-&^(d(x1),d(x4),d(x5));
  > v:= x2*d(x3)&^d(x4)-x3*d(x2)&^d(x4)+x4*d(x2)&^d(x3)
    +x3*d(x4)&^d(x5)-x4*d(x3)&^d(x5)+x5*d(x3)&^d(x4)
    +x1*d(x2)&^d(x7)-x2*d(x1)&^d(x7)+x7*d(x1)&^d(x2)
    -x1* d(x4)&^ d(x5)-x4*d(x1)&^d(x5)+x5*d(x1)&^d(x4);
  > w&^v&^v;

  The result is

(2.16)                   Qw = 6(−e21 + e2 e5 + e3 e6 + e4 e7 ),
                         Qw′ = 6(−e1 e4 + e2 e3 ).

   Since Qw is non-degenerate, the discriminant of Qx is a non-zero relative invari-
ant polynomial of degree 21 and this reproves the existence of a relative invariant
polynomial. Since Qw is irreducible, Qx is irreducible as a polynomial of v ∈ W ∗ .
If Qx is divisible by a non-constant polynomial p(x) of x, p(x) is a relative invariant
polynomial. Since Qw′ is degenerate, p(w′ ) = 0. But since Qw′ is non-zero, this is
a contradiction. So we get the following proposition.
Proposition (2.17) As a polynomial of (x, v) ∈ V ⊕ W ∗ , Qx (v) is irreducible.
   If A is a normed k–algebra, Re(A) is contained in the center of A. So the
structure of A is determined by its restriction to Im(A). On W ∗ , we define a
product structure ( · )x depending on x by the equation

(2.18)                    3x(v1 , v2 , v3 ) = Qx (v1 , (v2 · v3 )x )

for all v1 , v2 , v3 ∈ W ∗ . It is known [7, p. 86] that (G, V ) has a relative invariant
polynomial ∆(x) of degree seven. Since ch k = 0, we may assume that ∆(x) ∈ k[V ]

                                              9
and ∆(w) = 6. Clearly, ∆((t, g)x) = t7 (det g)3 ∆(x). For x ∈ Vkss and v ∈ Wk∗ , we
define

(2.19)                            kvkx = ∆(x)−1 Qx (v).

Definition (2.20) Ox is the algebra k ⊕ W ∗ such that W ∗ = Im(Ox ). The norm is
defined by kvk = kvkx for v ∈ W ∗ , and the product v1 v2 for v1 , v2 ∈ W ∗ is defined
by
              Re(v1 v2 ) = −∆(x)−1 Qx (v1 , v2 ), Im(v1 v2 ) = (v1 · v2 )x .

   If x = w, the product structure and the norm of Ow coincide with those of O       e
by Proposition (2.10). Therefore, Ow ∼     = Oe and is a normed k–algebra. Suppose
         ss
x, y ∈ Vk , (t, g) ∈ Gk̄ , and y = (t, g)x. Then we define mx,y,(t,g) : W ∗ → W ∗ by

(2.21)                          mx,y,(t,g) (v) = t2 (det g)gv

for v ∈ W ∗ . Note that we are taking the determinant of g considering g ∈ GL(W ).
Proposition (2.22) (1) For all x ∈ Vkss , Ox is a normed k–algebra and is a k–form
   e
of O.
(2) If x, y ∈ Vkss , (t, g) ∈ Gk̄ ,and y = (t, g)x, mx,y,(t,g) is an isomorphism of normed
k̄–algebras from Oxk̄ to Oyk̄ .
Proof. Let m = mx,y,(t,g) . Then

             Qy (gv1 , (m(v2 ) · m(v3 )y ) = t4 (det g)2 Qy (gv1 , (gv2 · gv3 )y )
                                           = 3t4 (det g)2 y(gv1 , gv2 , gv3 )
                                           = 3t4 (det g)2 g −1 y(v1 , v2 , v3 )
                                           = 3t5 (det g)2 x(v1 , v2 , v3 )
                                           = t5 (det g)2 Qx (v1 , (v2 · v3 )x )
                                           = t2 det gQy (gv1 , g(v2 · v3 )x )
                                           = Qy (gv1 , m(v2 · v3 )x )

for all v1 , v2 , v3 ∈ W ∗ .
   Therefore, (m(v2 ) · m(v3 ))y = m(v2 · v3 )x . Since

      ∆(y)−1 Qy (m(v1 ), m(v2 )) = (t7 (det g)3 )−1 t4 (det g)2 ∆(x)−1 Qy (gv1 , gv2 )
                                   = (t3 det g)−1 ∆(x)−1 t3 det gQx (v1 , v2 )
                                   = ∆(x)−1 Qx (v1 , v2 )

for all v1 , v2 ∈ W ∗ , m preserves the norm also.
   Since Ow is a normed k–algebra, this proves both (1), (2). 
                                                          e We regard Aut (O)
  Let O be the set of k–isomorphism classes of k–forms of O.               e ⊂
       e
GL(Im(O)).

                         e det g = 1.
Lemma (2.23) If g ∈ Aut (O),
Proof. Since Qw (gv1 , gv2 ) = Qw (v1 , v2 ) for all v1 , v2 ∈ W ∗ , (det g)2 = 1. Since
g(v1 · v2 )w = (gv1 · gv2 )w , gw = w by (2.18). It is proved in [7, p. 86] that if
g ∈ Gw ∩ GL(W ), (det g)3 = 1. This implies det g = (det g)3 /(det g)2 = 1. 

Proposition (2.24) The map

                                   αV : Gk \ Vkss ∋ x → Ox ∈ O

is well defined and is bijective.
Proof. If x, y ∈ Vkss , (t, g) ∈ Gk , and y = (t, g)x, then mx,y,(t,g) is a k–isomorphism.
Therefore, the above map is well defined. Suppose x, y ∈ Vkss and g ′ : Ox → Oy
is a k–isomorphism. Regarding g ′ ∈ GL(W )k (by considering the contragredient
representation), let t = (det g ′ )3 , g = (det g ′ )−1 g ′ . Then (t, g) ∈ Gk and t2 det gg =
g ′ . Since ∆(x)−1 Qx (v1 , v2 ) = ∆(y)−1 Qy (g ′ v1 , g ′ v2 ) for all v1 , v2 ∈ W ∗ , by a similar
argument as in Proposition (2.22), Q(t,g)−1 y = Qx . So


  3t4 (det g)2 g −1 y(v1 , v2 , v3 ) = 3y(gv1 , g ′ v2 , g ′ v3 )
                                     = Qy (gv1 , (g ′ v2 · g ′ v3 )y )
                                     = Qy (gv1 , g ′ (v2 · v3 )x )
                                     = t2 det gQy (gv1 , g(v2 · v3 )x )
                                     = t5 (det g)2 Q(t,g)−1 (v1 , (v2 · v3 )x )
                                     = t5 (det g)2 Qx (v1 , (v2 · v3 )x )   by the above remark
                                     = 3t5 (det g)2 x(v1 , v2 , v3 )

for all v1 , v2 , v3 ∈ W ∗ .
   Therefore, y = (t, g)x ∈ Gk x.
   Let A be a k–form of O    e corresponding to a cohomology class c ∈ H1 (k, Aut (O)).
                                                                                   e
Suppose c = {hσ }σ . Then

                Im(A)k = {v ∈ Im(O) k̄


             e ⊂ GL(Im(O))
  Since Aut (O)            e and H1 (k, GL(Im(O)))
                                              e    is trivial, there exists g ′ ∈

                                                                            e →
So A is characterized as the k–form such that g ′ induces an isomorphism Im(O) k̄

  Let t = (det g ′ )3 and g = (det g ′ )−1 g ′ . Then (t, g) ∈ Gk̄ . By Lemma (2.23),

                        (t, g)−1 (t, g)σ = (1, g ′−1 g ′σ ) ∈ Gwk̄ .

So this defines a cohomology class in H1 (k, Gw ). This implies that x = (t, g)w ∈
                                                                   e to Im(Ox ) .

Therefore, A = Ox . 

Remark (2.25) It is proved in [7], [4] that Gk \ Vkss ∼                   e
                                                           = H1 (k, Aut (O)). So the
                                                                       ss
credit for the existence of a bijective correspondence between Gk \Vk and O should
go to Sato–Kimura [7] and Igusa [4]. However, we constructed Ox ∈ O for x ∈ Vkss ,
and the fact that this particular correspondence is bijective still required a proof.
The operator D3 was considered in [7]. The fact that the stabilizer of w is a group
of type G2 at least goes back to [7].
   For the rest of this section, we describe the orbit space GR \VRss ∼
                                                                      = GL(W )R \VRss .
We will show that GR \ VRss consists of two orbits corresponding to O, O. e
   It is known that O, O e are the only R–forms of O.e We can identify H with C(+)
by
                        a + bi + cj + dk → (a + bi) + (c + di)ǫ.
So H ⊗ C and M(2, 2)C are isomorphic by the map

for a, b, c, d ∈ C (see (2.6)).
                                       e = M(2, 2)(+), O ⊗ C and O
   Therefore, by considering O = H(+), O                         e ⊗ C are
isomorphic by the map

  Note that det g1 = 23 . So we put t = 29 , g = 2−3 g1 following the argument of
Proposition (2.24). Then t2 det gg = g1 .
  Consider (t, g) ∈ GL(W ). Since tgv = 26 g1 v for v ∈ W , by (t, g), (e1 , · · · , e7 )
maps to 26 (e1 , · · · , e7 )g1 . By an easy computation,

(2.26)       w1 = (t, g)w = 27 (e145 − e167 + e347 − e356 + e123 + e246 + e257 ).

By the proof of Proposition (2.24), w1 corresponds to O. It is easy to see that

(2.27)                          kφ(y)kw = y12 + · · · + y72 .

   Since ∆(w1 ) = 29 · 6, Qw1 (y) = 29 · 6(y12 + · · · + y72 ). Since Hw0 1 ⊂ SO(Qw1 ), the
real rank of Hw0 1 R is zero.

§3 Intermediate groups

   For x ∈ Vkss , let hx be the Lie algebra of Hx0 . Consider the element w for cases
(1)–(3). Let h1 = hw and h2 = sl(6), sl(7), or sl(2n). In this section, we consider
Lie subalgebras of h2 containing h1 .
   We first consider case (1). Clearly,

   Obviously h1 is contained in the following Lie algebras

(3.3)              h3 = h1 ⊕ u 1 , h4 = h1 ⊕ u 2 ,
                   h′1 = h1 ⊕ t, h′3 = h1 ⊕ u1 ⊕ t, h′4 = h1 ⊕ u2 ⊕ t.

Proposition (3.4) If h1 ⊂ f ⊂ h2 is a Lie subalgebra, f = h1 , h′1 , h2 , h3 , h′3 , h4 , or
h′4 .
Proof. As a h1 –module, h2 decomposes as a direct sum of representations as

(3.5)                               h2 = h1 ⊕ u1 ⊕ u2 ⊕ t.

Let Λ1 , Λ2 be the usual fundamental weights of sl(3), and V1 , V2 the irreducible
representations with highest weights Λ1 , Λ2 respectively.

                                              13
   Then u1 ∼= V1 ⊗V2 , u2 = V2 ⊗V1 , and t is the trivial representation. Let V3 be the
representation of sl(3) with highest weight Λ1 + Λ2 . Let V3,1 be the representation
of h1 which is the tensor product of V3 for the first factor of sl(3) and the trivial
representation for the second factor of sl(3). We define V3,2 similarly. Then h1 is
V3,1 ⊕ V3,2 as a representation of h1 . No two of these irreducible representations
are equivalent. So

(3.6)                      f = h1 ⊕ (f ∩ u1 ) ⊕ (f ∩ u2 ) ⊕ (f ∩ t).

    Clearly, f ∩ u1 = u1 or 0, etc. Since h1 , u1 , u2 generate h2 , if f contains both
u1 , u2 , f = h2 . This proves the proposition. 

This definition does not depend on the choice of g ∈ GR .
Proposition (3.9) Suppose x ∈ GR w. Then if Hx1R+ ⊂ F ⊂ HR is a closed
connected subgroup whose radical is a unipotent subgroup, F = Hx1R , Hx2R , Hx3R ,
or Hx4R .
Proof. Let f be the Lie algebra of F . Then h1R ⊂ g −1 fg ⊂ h2R . So g −1 fg =
h1R , h′1R , h2R , h3R , h4R , h′3R , or h′4R . But it cannot be h′1R , h′3R or h′4R because the
radical of F is a unipotent subgroup. This proves the proposition. 
   We consider the orbit of w1 (see (1.13)) next. Let gw1 = g√−1 (see (1.8)).

Proposition (3.10) Let x = gw1 for g ∈ GR . Then if HxR+        ⊂ F ⊂ HR is the

over Q whose radical is a unipotent subgroup, F = HxR+  or HR .
Proof. As in the previous proposition, we only have to consider the case x = w1 .
Let f be the Lie algebra of F , and FC ⊂ HC the closed connected subgroup whose Lie
algebra is fC . Then the radical of FC is a unipotent subgroup and F is the connected
component of the set of R–rational points of FC . So by a similar argument as in
Proposition (3.9), fC = hw1 1C , hw1 2C , hw1 3C , or hw1 4C . We show that the last two
cases cannot happen. Since the argument is similar, we only consider the case
f = hw1 3C .

This implies f = hw1 R , which is a contradiction. 

   Next, we consider case (2). Let h3 = so(Qw ).
Proposition (3.11) Suppose k is algebraically closed. Then if h1 ⊂ f ⊂ h2 is a Lie
subalgebra, f = h1 , h2 , or h3 .
Proof. Recall that h1 is the simple Lie algebra of type G2 and h1 ⊂ h3 ⊂ h2 . Let
W be the standard 7 dimensional representation of sl(7). As a representation of
h1 , W is irreducible and has highest weight equal to a fundamental weight Λ1 .
There are no non-trivial representations of h1 of lower dimension. The h1 –invariant
complement to h1 in h3 is 7 dimensional and non-trivial (as h3 is simple). Therefore
h3 = h1 ⊕ W . Now consider h3 ⊂ h2 . Let θ be the order two automorphism of h2
defined by θ(X) = −∗ X (the adjoint with respect to Qw ). Then the fixed point set
of θ is h3 . Write h2 = h3 ⊕ U , the ±1 eigenspace decomposition for θ. Then [U, U ]
is contained in h3 and is h3 –invariant, so [U, U ] = h3 . Note that h2 ∼= W ⊗ W∗
and W ∼  = W ∗ , as h2 –representations. Because the weight 2Λ1 does not occur in h3 ,
this implies that the representation U has highest weight 2Λ1 . The irreducible
representation with highest weight 2Λ1 has dimension 27 [7, p. 21], the same as U ,
so U is irreducible. Thus, h2 = h1 ⊕ W ⊕ U , as representations of h1 .
    Now suppose that f is a subalgebra with h1 ⊂ f ⊂ h2 with f 6= h3 . Then if f
contains U it contains h3 , so must equal h2 . The proposition follows. 

Corollary (3.12) Suppose x ∈ VRss . Then if HxR+
                                             0
                                                 ⊂ F ⊂ HR is a closed connected
               0
subgroup, F = HxR+ , SO(Qx )R , or HR .
Proof. Let f be the Lie algebra of F . Then hxC ⊂ fC ⊂ h2C and f = fC ∩h2 . Suppose
x = gw where g ∈ GC . Then

                                    g −1 hxC g = h1C ⊂ g −1 fC g ⊂ h2C .

So g −1 fC g = h1C , so(Qw )C , or h2C . Therefore,

                fC = gh1C g −1 = hxC , gso(Qw )C g −1 = so(Qx )C , or h2C .

This implies that
                                           f = hxR , so(Qx )R , or h2R .
  

   Finally, we consider case (3).
                       0                                                 0
Proposition (3.13) If HwR+ ⊂ F ⊂ HR is a closed connected subgroup, F = HwR+
or HR .

                                                           15
Proof. Let f be the Lie algebra of F . Then h1 ⊂ f ⊂ h2 . Let Λ1 , Λ2 be the first and
the second fundamental weights of h1 . Then the standard representation V1 = W
of h1 has the highest weight Λ1 . Let V2 be the irreducible representation of h1
with highest weight Λ2 . Since w is a Gw –invariant non-degenerate bilinear form on
W ∗ , W is equivalent to W ∗ . So h2 plus the trivial representation is equivalent to
W ⊗ W . Clearly W ⊗ W ∼    = ∧2 W ⊕ Sym2 W . It is known (see [7, pp. 14,15]) that
∧2 W is a sum of V2 and the trivial representation. As a representation of h1 , h1
is irreducible and has the same highest weight 2Λ1 as Sym2 W . By eliminating the
trivial representation,
                                    h2 = h1 ⊕ V2 .
Since h1 , V2 are not equivalent, f = h1 ⊕ (f ∩ V2 ). So f = h1 or h2 . 
  Since VRss is a single GR –orbit in this case, the following is an immediate conse-
quence of the above proposition.
Corollary (3.14) Suppose x ∈ VRss . Then if HxR+
                                             0
                                                 ⊂ F ⊂ HR is a closed connected
               0
subgroup, F = HxR+ , or HR .

§4 The fixed point set of Hx0

   We consider the fixed point set of Hx0 for x ∈ Vkss . Throughout this section, we
assume that k is algebraically closed.
   We first consider case (1). Let W be the standard representation of GL(6).
                                         0
Proposition (4.1) If y ∈ Vk is fixed by Hwk , there exist α1 , α2 ∈ k such that
x = α1 e123 + α2 e456 .
Proof. We use the notation of (3.1)–(3.6). Let V1,1 be the representation of h1
which is the tensor product of V1 for the first factor and the trivial representation
for the second factor. We define V1,2 similarly. Then W = V1,1 ⊕ V1,2 . Therefore,

(4.2)       ∧3 W ∼
                 = ∧3 V1,1 ⊕ (∧2 V1,1 ⊗ V1,2 ) ⊕ (V1,1 ⊗ ∧2 V1,2 ) ⊕ ∧3 V1,2 .

The second and the third factors are irreducible and non-trivial, and the first and
the fourth factors are the trivial representation. Therefore, the dimension of the
subspace
                                                      0
                         {y ∈ V | gy = y for all g ∈ Hwk }
is two.
    Obviously, α1 e123 + α2 e456 belongs to the above space for all α1 , α2 ∈ k. This
proves the proposition. 
  The following is an immediate consequence of the above proposition.
Corollary (4.3) Let x ∈ Vkss . Then if y ∈ Vk is fixed by Hxk
                                                           0
                                                              , Gr(y) = Gr(x).
  We consider case (2) next. Let W be the standard representation of GL(7).
                                         0
Proposition (4.4) If y ∈ Vk is fixed by Hwk , y is a scalar multiple of w.
Proof. Recall that Hw0 is a simple group of type G2 and W is the 7 dimensional
irreducible representation with highest weight Λ1 . We show that the 35 dimensional

                                           16
representation ∧3 W contains the trivial representation k exactly once. The weights
of W are the short roots of g2 , together with zero, so the non-zero weights form
the vertices of a regular hexagon centered at 0. Therefore, by listing the non-zero
weights α1 , . . . , α6 in the order they appear around the hexagon (with α1 = Λ1 ),
we have αi−1 + αi+1 = αi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 (with subscripts read modulo 6). So one
sees that the highest weight of ∧3 W is 2Λ1 (from the sum α6 + α1 + α2 ) and the
multiplicity of the zero weight is 5 (from the three sums of the form −αi + 0 + αi
and the two sums of the form αi +αi+2 +αi+4 ). Since the irreducible representation
with highest weight 2Λ1 has dimension 27 and must occur, 8 dimensions remain. As
the smallest non-trivial representation of G2 has dimension 7, the only possibility
is W plus one copy of the trivial representation. Thus, ∧3 W = U ⊕ W ⊕ k. 
  The following is an immediate consequence of the above proposition.
Corollary (4.5) Let x ∈ Vkss . Then if y ∈ Vk is fixed by Hxk
                                                           0
                                                              , y is a scalar multiple
of x.
   Finally we consider case (3). Let W be the standard representation of Sp(2n).
As we pointed out in §3, ∧2 W is a sum of a non-trivial irreducible representation
and the trivial representation. Therefore, the following proposition follows by an
argument as above.
Proposition (4.6) Let x ∈ Vkss . Then if y ∈ Vk is fixed by Hxk
                                                             0
                                                                , y is a scalar
multiple of x.

§5 The orbit closure

   In this section, we formulate irrationality conditions for x ∈ VRss for cases (1)–
                                    0
(3) and prove that the orbit of HxR+    in HR /Γ is dense if x ∈ VRss is sufficiently
irrational.
   Consider case (1). Let G, V, W, w0 = w, w1 , etc. be as in §1.
Definition (5.1)(1) A point x ∈ GR w is sufficiently irrational if both [Ex1 ], [Ex2 ] ∈
Gr(3, 6)C are irrational and Gr(x) ∈ ((Z/2Z)\(Gr(3, 6)×Gr(3, 6)))R is irrational. A
point x ∈ GR w1 is sufficiently irrational if Gr(x) ∈ ((Z/2Z) \ (Gr(3, 6) × Gr(3, 6)))R
is irrational.
   Note that if x ∈ GR w1 , Ex1 , Ex2 are complex conjugates of each other. So
the irrationality of one of [Ex1 ], [Ex2 ] implies the irrationality of the other. Also
even though we cannot distinguish [Ex1 ], [Ex2 ], if we say both are irrational, the
statement makes sense.
   Next consider case (2). Let G, V, W , etc. be as in §2.
Definition (5.1)(2) A point x ∈ VRss is sufficiently irrational if [Qx ] ∈ P(Sym2 W )R
is irrational.
  Next consider case (3). Let W be the standard representation of GL(2n) and
V = ∧2 W .
Definition (5.1)(3) A point x ∈ VRss is sufficiently irrational if [x] ∈ P(V )R is
irrational.
                                               0
  Now we are ready to prove that the orbit of HxR+ is dense.

                                          17
Theorem (5.2) Let Γ ⊂ SL(W )R be an arithmetic lattice. Then if x ∈ VRss is
sufficiently irrational in the sense of Definition (5.2)(1)–(3) and the real rank of
  0                 0
HxR   is positive, HxR+ Γ is dense in HR .
                                       0
Proof. Note that the real rank of HxR      is positive for all x ∈ VRss for cases (1), (3),
and for x ∈ GR w for case (2).
   The proof for case (2) is the same as the proof of Theorem (5.1) [10] (using
Corollaries (3.12),(4.5)). The proof for case (3) is also similar using Corollary
(3.14) and Proposition (4.6). So we only consider case (1).
   By Ratner’s theorem (see the introduction of [10]), there exists a connected
                    0                                      0
closed subgroup HxR+      ⊂ F ⊂ SL(W )R such that HxR+         Γ = F Γ. By Proposition
(3.2) [8, pp. 321–322], F is defined over Q and the radical of F is a unipotent
subgroup . So by Propositions (3.9), (3.10), F = Hx1R , Hx2R , Hx3R , or Hx4R .
                   0
   Suppose F = HxR+     . Since F is defined over Q, for any σ ∈ Aut (C/Q), FCσ = FC .
So Hxσ C = HxC = HxC . Since this group fixes xσ ,
      0       0       0

                               Gr(x)σ = Gr(xσ ) = Gr(x)
by Proposition (1.20) and Corollary (4.3). Since this is the case for all σ, Gr(x) is
a Q–rational point of (Z/2Z) \ (Gr(3, 6) × Gr(3, 6)), which is a contradiction.
   Suppose F = Hx3R or Hx4R (which means x ∈ GR w). Since the argument is
similar, we only consider the case F = Hx3R . Suppose x = gw for g ∈ GL(W )C .
Then if σ ∈ Aut (C/Q), xσ = g σ w and
                   σ                                                   

                        0 B
                = Hxσ 3C .
                                                    σ
   Since this group is defined over Q, Hx3C = Hx3C       = Hxσ 3C . Note that [Ew1 ] ∈
Gr(3, 6)C is the unique point fixed by Hw3C . Since g[Ew1] (resp. g σ [Ew1 ]) is fixed
by Hx3C (resp. Hxσ 3C ), g[Ew1 ] = g σ [Ew1 ] = (g[Ew1])σ . Since this is the case for all
σ, g[Ew1 ] must be a Q–rational point of Gr(3, 6). So either [Ex1 ] or [Ex2 ] is a Q–
rational point of Gr(3, 6), which is a contradiction. This proves that F = HR . 

§6 Analogues of the Oppenheim conjecture

   We prove our main theorem of this paper in this section.
   We consider case (1) in (6.1)–(6.6). Consider V, W, {e1 , · · · , e6 }, v, w0 = w, w1 in
§1.
Proposition (6.1) Let y = (yijk ) ∈ ∧3 R5 , and ǫ > 0. Then there exist z0 =
(z0,ijk ) ∈ GR w0 and z1 = (z1,ijk ) ∈ GR w1 such that |yijk − zl,ijk | < ǫ for l =
0, 1, 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ 5.
Proof. Let z = (zijk ) and
                                                                       
                   z234 −z134       z124        z156         −z146   z145
(6.2)           
           X = z235 −z135                    
                                    z125 , Y = z256          −z246   z245  .
                   z236 −z136       z126        z356         −z346   z345

                                            18
   Note that z ∈ GR w0 (resp. z ∈ GR w1 ) if and only if ∆(z) > 0 (resp. ∆(z) < 0).
It is proved in [7, p. 83] that

(6.3)                  ∆(z) = (z123 z456 − tr(XY ))2 + 4z123 det Y
                                                X
                              + 4z123 det X − 4      det Xij det Yji ,
                                                          i,j

where Xij , Yji are the (i, j)–minor and the (j, i)–minor of X, Y respectively.
   As a polynomial of z456 , this is a quadratic polynomial and the coefficient of
 2       2
z456 is z123 . Given y, we can choose z123 6= 0 close to y123 . By taking z456 ≫ 0,
∆(z) > 0. So the existence of z0 follows.
   We try to choose z1 so that z1,ij6 = 0 unless (i, j) = (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 5). So we
assume zij6 = 0 unless (i, j) = (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 5) in the following. We first choose
z123 6= 0 close to y123 . Then
                          2
(6.4)             ∆(z) = z123          −1
                              (z456 − z123 tr(XY ))2 + 4z123 det Y
                                        −1
                            + 4(z456 − z123 tr(XY )) det X
                                                      X
                                −1
                            + 4z123 tr(XY ) det X − 4     det Xij det Yji .
                                                                i,j

                                         −1
    As a quadratic polynomial of z456 − z123 tr(XY ), (6.4) can take a negative value
if the discriminant is positive. Let
                                2
(6.5)               f1 (z) = 16z123 (−z123 z345 + z234 z135 + z145 z235 )

Then a simple consideration shows that there exist polynomials f2 (z), f3 (z), f4 (z)
which depend only on (zijk )i<j<k≤5 such that the the discriminant of (6.4) is

(6.6)                 f1 (z)z156 z246 + f2 (z)z156 + f3 (z)z246 + f4 (z).

   Note that if f is a non-zero polynomial on a real vector space UR , the set {p ∈ UR |
f (p) 6= 0} is open dense in UR in classical topology. Since f1 (z) is not identically
zero, we can choose (zijk )i<j<k≤5 close to y so that f1 (z) 6= 0. If f1 (z) > 0, we
choose z156 = z246 ≫ 0. If f1 (z) < 0, we choose z156 = −z246 ≫ 0. In both cases,
we can make (6.6) positive. 
   We consider case (2) in (6.7)–(6.13). Consider V, W, {e1 , · · · , e7 }, v, w in §2. We
use the notation ei1 ···ik = ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik as before.
Proposition (6.7) Let y = (yijk ) ∈ ∧3 R6 , and ǫ > 0. Then there exists z =
(zijk ) ∈ GR w such that |yijk − zijk | < ǫ for 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ 6.
Proof. We try to choose z so that z ∈ VRss , Qz (v1 ) > 0, and Qz (v7 ) < 0. This
condition ensures that Qz is indefinite and therefore, z ∈ GR w. Let

(2) The coefficient of v72 in Qz is
                                        X                                              
                                                                      1 ···       6
               f2 (z) =                                     sgn                             zij7 zi′ j ′ 7 zi′′ j ′′ 7 .
                                                                      i ···      j ′′
                             (i,j,i′ ,j ′ ,i′′ ,j ′′ )∈I2


Proof. We consider (1) first. Consider z ∧ D3 (z) ∧ D3 (z).
                                 X
(6.10)         D3 (z) =                     zi′ j ′ k′ (ej ′ k′ ⊗ ei′ − ei′ k′ ⊗ ej ′ + ei′ j ′ ⊗ ek′ ).
                              i′ <j ′ <k′


   Since j ′ , k ′ > 1, the terms in the right hand side of (6.10) which has e1 as the
second factor are those with i′ = 1. Therefore,

(6.11)     z ∧ D3 (z) ∧ D3 (z)
                                                                                  
                XX X
            =                 xijk x1j ′ k′ x1j ′′ k′′ eijk ∧ ej ′ k′ ∧ ej ′′ k′′  ⊗ e1 ⊗ e1
                  i,j,k j ′ ,k′ j ′′ ,k′′
               +··· .

   Clearly, eijk ∧ ej ′ k′ ∧ ej ′′ k′′ = 0 unless i = 1 and (j, k, j ′ , k ′ , j ′′ , k ′′ ) ∈ I1 . So we
only have to consider indices in I1 . If (j, k, j ′ , k ′ , j ′′ , k ′′ ) ∈ I1 ,
                                                                         
                                                     2 ··· 7
                  eijk ∧ ej ′ k′ ∧ ej ′′ k′′ = sgn                          e234567 .
                                                     j · · · k ′′

This proves (1).
  Note that
                            eij7 ∧ ei′ j ′ ∧ ei′′ j ′′ = eij ∧ ei′ j ′ ∧ ei′′ j ′′ ∧ e7 .
So (2) is similar. 
   We consider z such that zij7 = 0 unless (i, j) = (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6). Note that
this has no effect on zijk with i < j < k ≤ 6. We define
                                             X                                         
                                                                       3   ···    6
(6.12)                 f3 (z) =                             sgn                             z1jk z1j ′ k′ .
                                                                       j   ···    k′
                                      (j,k,j ′ ,k′ )∈I3


   The following is an immediate consequence of the above Lemma.
Corollary (6.13) Suppose zij7 = 0 unless (i, j) = (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6). Then there
exists a polynomial f4 (z) which does not depend on z127 , z347 , z567 such that

                     f1 (z) = 3z127 f3 (z) + f4 (z), f2 (z) = 6z127 z347 z567 .

                                                                  20
    Since f3 (z) is non-zero, we can choose (zijk )i<j<k≤6 arbitrarily close to y and
f3 (z) 6= 0. If f3 (z) > 0, we choose z127 ≫ 0, z347 z567 < 0. If f3 (z) > 0, we choose
z127 ≪ 0, z347 z567 > 0. In both cases, f1 (z) > 0, f2 (z) < 0. Since VRss is open
dense in VR , we can replace z if necessary and assume that z ∈ VRss . In this process,
the condition f1 (z) > 0, f2 (z) < 0 can be preserved. This completes the proof of
Proposition (6.7). 
   Now we consider case (3). So G = GL(2n), W = Q2n , V = ∧2 W . In this case,
VRss is a single GR –orbit. So the following proposition is obvious.
Proposition (6.14) Let y = (yij ) ∈ ∧2 R2n−1 , and ǫ > 0. Then there exist
z = (zij ) ∈ VRss such that |yij − zij | < ǫ for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2n − 1.
   Now we are ready to prove our main theorem. In statements (1)–(3) of the
following theorem, we consider the prehomogeneous vector spaces (1)–(3) of this
paper respectively. Let W be the standard representation of GL(6), GL(7), or
GL(2n). We identify ∧3 W and ∧2 W with ∧3 (W ∗ )∗ and ∧2 (W ∗ )∗ respectively.
Theorem (6.15) Suppose x ∈ VRss is sufficiently irrational in the sense of Definition
                                    0
(5.1)(1)–(3) and the real rank of HxR  is positive.
                             3 5
(1) For any y = (yijk ) ∈ ∧ R and ǫ > 0, there exists a Z–basis {u1 , · · · , u6 } of
WZ∗ ∼
    = Z6 such that
                              |yijk − x(ui , uj , uk )| < ǫ

for all i < j < k ≤ 5.
(2) For any y = (yijk ) ∈ ∧3 R6 and ǫ > 0, there exists a Z–basis {u1 , · · · , u7 } of
WZ∗ ∼
    = Z7 such that
                             |yijk − x(ui , uj , uk )| < ǫ

for all i < j < k ≤ 6.
(3) For any y = (yij ) ∈ ∧2 R2n−1 and ǫ > 0, there exists a Z–basis {u1 , · · · , u2n } of
WZ∗ ∼
    = Z2n such that
                                |yij − x(ui , uj )| < ǫ

for all i < j ≤ 2n − 1.
Proof. Since the proof is similar we only consider case (1). For cases (2), (3) the
argument is similar using Theorem (5.2) and Propositions (6.7), (6.14).
   By Proposition (6.1), we can choose z = (zijk ) ∈ GR x such that |yijk − zijk | < 2ǫ
for 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ 5. Since any element of GR can be written as a product of an
element of HR and a scalar matrix, we can choose h′ ∈ HR and λ ∈ R \ {0} so that
h′−1 x = λz. Let              1                    
                                λ3
                                    ..             
                      h = h′           .            ∈ HR .
                                          1
                                          λ3        
                                                      5
                                                  λ− 3
We put z ′ = h−1 x. Then if z ′ = (zijk
                                    ′       ′
                                        ), zijk = zijk for all i < j < k ≤ 5.
                         0                                                    0
   By Theorem (5.2), HxR+ HZ is dense in HR . So we can choose h1 ∈ HxR+        and
                                                    −1       −1 −1       −1
h2 ∈ HZ so that h1 h2 is close to h. Then (h1 h2 ) x = h2 h1 x = h2 x is close to

                                           21
z ′ = h−1 x. Let f1 , · · · , f6 be the standard coordinate vectors of W ∗ . Since h−1
                                                                                    2 x is
close to z ′ , we can assume that
                                                                                               ǫ
          |z ′ (fi , fj , fk ) − h−1
                                  2 x(fi , fj , fk )| = |zijk − x(h2 fi , h2 fj , h2 fk )| <
                                                                                               2
for all i < j < k ≤ 5.
   Let u1 = h2 f1 , · · · , u6 = h2 f6 . Since h2 ∈ HZ , {u1 , · · · , u6 } is a Z–basis of WZ∗ .
Moreover,

            |yijk − x(ui , uj , uk )| ≤ |yijk − zijk | + |zijk − x(ui , uj , uk )| < ǫ

for all i < j < k ≤ 5. This proves the theorem.               
