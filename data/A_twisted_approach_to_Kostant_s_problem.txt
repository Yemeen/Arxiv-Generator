                                                A twisted approach to Kostant’s problem
                                                                      Volodymyr Mazorchuk

                                                      We use Arkhipov’s twisting functors to show that the universal

                                                  gebra surjects onto the space of ad-finite endomorphisms of the simple
                                                  highest weight module L(λ), whose highest weight is associated (in the
                                                  natural way) with a subset of simple roots and a simple root in this
                                                  subset. This is a new step towards a complete answer to a classi-
                                                  cal question of Kostant. We also show how one can use the twisting
                                                  functors to reprove the classical results related to this question.


                                            1     Introduction and notation
                                            Let g be a complex semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra with a fixed
                                            triangular decomposition, g = n− ⊕h⊕n+ , and U(g) be its universal envelop-
                                            ing algebra. Then for every two g-modules M and N the space HomC (M, N)
                                            can be viewed as a U(g)-bimodule in the natural way (with the right action of
                                            U(g) defined via the Chevalley involution). This bimodule then also becomes
                                            a g-module under the adjoint action. The bimodule HomC (M, N) has a sub-
                                            bimodule, usually denoted by L (M, N) (see for example [Ja, Kapitel 6]),
                                            which consists of all elements, the adjoint action of U(g) on which is locally
                                            finite. Since U(g) itself consists of locally finite elements under the adjoint
                                            action, it naturally maps to L (M, M) for every g-module M, and the kernel
                                            of this map is the annihilator Ann(M) of M in U(g). The classical problem
                                            of Kostant (see for example [Jo2]) is formulated in the following way:

                                                For which simple g-modules M the natural injection

                                                                     U(g)/Ann(M) ֒→ L (M, M)

                                            is surjective?

                                               The complete answer to this problem is not known even for simple highest
                                            weight modules. However, it is known that there are simple highest weight

                                                                                    1
modules for which the answer is negative (see for example [Jo2, 9.5]). There
is also a classical class of simple highest weight modules, for which the answer
is positive. It consists of all simple highest weight modules, whose highest
weights are obtained from the antidominant one, applying the longest element
of some parabolic subgroup of the Weyl group, see [GJ, Jo2, Ja].
    In the present paper we propose an approach to this problem, which uses
Arkhipov’s twisting functors, see [Ar], and is based on the properties of these
functors obtained in [AS]. In [KM] it was shown that Arkhipov’s functors
are adjoint to Joseph’s completion functors, see [Jo1], which suggests a close
connection to Kostant’s problem. We base our arguments mostly on the
results of [AS] and also use some results from [Kh, KM, MS]. The main
properties of the twisting functors which we use are: the combinatorics of
their action on Verma modules and the fact that they define a self-equivalence
of the bounded derived category D b (O) of the BGG-category O. All this can
be found in [AS].
    Let R be the root system of g with the basis B, which corresponds to the
triangular decomposition above. Let further W denote the Weyl group of g
with the identity element e. Then W acts on h∗ both in the natural way (i.e.
λ 7→ w(λ) for λ ∈ h∗ and w ∈ W ) and via the dot action defined as follows:
w · λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ, λ ∈ h∗ , w ∈ W , where ρ is the half of the sum of all
positive roots. For α ∈ R denote by sα the corresponding simple reflection,
and for a reflection, s ∈ W , we let αs ∈ R be such that s = sαs . Fix some
Weyl-Chevalley basis in g, say

                       {Xα : α ∈ R} ∪ {Hβ : β ∈ B},

and define Hα , α ∈ R, in the usual way.
    For λ ∈ h∗ the set Rλ = {α ∈ R : λ(Hα ) ∈ Z} is a root system and the
triangular decomposition of g induces a uniquely defined basis, Bλ , of Rλ .
Let Wλ be the Weyl group of Rλ . We call λ relatively dominant provided
that λ is a dominant element in {w · λ : w ∈ Wλ } and regular provided that
the stabilizer of λ in Wλ with respect to the dot action is trivial.

   Throughout the paper we fix a relatively dominant and regular λ ∈ h∗ .

    For w ∈ Wλ we denote by ∆(w) the Verma module with the highest
weight w · λ, and by L(w) the unique simple quotient of ∆(w), see [Di,
Chapter 7]. For S ⊂ Bλ we denote by WλS the subgroup of Wλ , generated
by sα , α ∈ S. Denote by wλS the longest element in WλS (in particular, wλBλ
is the longest element in Wλ ). The main result of the present paper is the
following statement:


                                       2
Theorem 1. Let S ⊂ Bλ , α ∈ S, and set w = sα wλS wλBλ . Then the canonical
inclusion
                 U(g)/Ann(L(w)) ֒→ L (L(w), L(w))
is surjective.

    The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we collect all necessary
preliminaries on the category O and Arkhipov’s twisting functors. In Sec-
tion 3 we show how one can apply the twisting functors to obtain the classical
results related to Kostant’s problem (in principal, if one takes into account
the relation between the twisting functors and Joseph’s completion functors,
obtained in [KM], our approach here is rather similar to the original ap-
proach, however, here it is formulated in a shorter way). In Section 4 we
prove Theorem 1 in the case S = Bλ . This is then used in Section 5 to
prove Theorem 1 in the general case. In Section 6 we present an application
of Theorem 1 and answer Kostant’s question for some simple α-stratified
modules.


2     Preliminaries about the category O
Let O denote the BGG-category O, associated with the triangular decom-
position of g, fixed above, see [BGG1]. Let ⋆ : O → O be the classical
duality on O, that is a contravariant exact involutive equivalence, preserving
the isomorphism classes of simple module, see [Ir, Section 5]. Let Oλ denote
the indecomposable block of O, whose simple modules have the form L(w),
w ∈ Wλ . Denote further by P (w) the indecomposable projective cover of
L(w), see [BGG1], and by θw the indecomposable projective functor on Oλ ,
uniquely determined by the property θw ∆(e) ∼     = P (w), see [BG, I.3]. Then
{θw : w ∈ Wλ } are exactly the direct summands of the composition of V ⊗ −
followed by the projection from O to Oλ , if we let V run through all the
finite-dimensional g-modules.
    For w ∈ Wλ set ∇(w) = ∆(w)⋆ and denote by Fλ (∆) the full subcategory
of Oλ , which consists of all modules, having a filtration, whose subquotients
are isomorphic to Verma modules. Set Fλ (∇) = Fλ (∆)⋆ .
    Let D b (Oλ ) denote the bounded derived category of Oλ . For a right or
a left exact functor, F , on Oλ we denote by LF and RF the corresponding
left and right derived functors respectively. For i ≥ 0 we denote by Li F
and Ri F the corresponding i-th cohomology functors. We denote by [1] the
shifting functor on D b (Oλ ) such that for every complex X • ∈ D b (Oλ ) and for
all i ∈ Z we have X [1]i = X i+1 . We consider Oλ as a subcategory of D b (Oλ )
via the classical embedding in degree zero.

                                       3
    Via the equivalence from [So] for w ∈ Wλ we can define on Oλ Arkhipov’s
twisting functor Tw , see [Ar, AS, KM], and denote by Gw its right adjoint
(which is isomorphic, by [KM, Corollary 6], to corresponding Joseph’s com-
pletion functor from [Jo1], and to the functor ⋆Tw ⋆, see [AS, Theorem 4.1]).
In this paper we will use the following properties of Tw (the functor Gw has
dual properties):

    (I) For every w, x ∈ Wλ we have Tw θx ∼
                                          = θx Tw , see [AS, Theorem 3.2].
  (II) For every w, x ∈ Wλ and i > 0 we have Li Tw ∆(x) = 0, see [AS,
       Theorem 2.2].

 (III) For every w ∈ Wλ the functor LTw is an autoequivalence of D b (Oλ )
       with the inverse functor RGw−1 , see [AS, Corollary 4.2].

 (IV) For every w ∈ Wλ and every reduced decomposition, w = s1 . . . sk , we
      have Tw ∼
              = Ts1 · · · · · Tsk , see [AS, Lemma 2.1] and [KM, Corollary 11].
  (V) For every x ∈ Wλ and every simple reflection s ∈ Wλ such that sx > x
      we have Ts ∆(x) ∼
                      = ∆(sx), see [AL, Lemma 6.2];

 (VI) For every x ∈ Wλ and every simple reflection s ∈ Wλ we have
                                   (
                                    ∇(x), x < sx,
                         Ts ∇(x) ∼
                                 =
                                    ∇(sx), x > sx,

       see [AS, Theorem 2.3].

(VII) For every x ∈ Wλ and every simple reflection s ∈ Wλ we have that
      Ts L(x) 6= 0 if and only if sx < x, see [AS, Section 6].

(VIII) For every simple reflection s ∈ Wλ and for every M ∈ Oλ the module
       L1 Ts (M) is the largest s-finite submodule of M, see [MS, Theorem 1]
       or [Kh, Proposition 6].


3      The classical results
We start with some preparation, during which we use the twisting functors
to obtain several classical results related to Kostant’s problem. We base our
approach on two classical statements. The first one, which can be found in
[Ja, 6.8], is a very abstract property of L (M, N):



                                      4
Proposition 2. Let M, N be g-modules and V be a finite-dimensional g-
module. Then there are canonical isomorphisms
       Homg(V, L (M, N)) ∼
                         = Homg(M ⊗ V, N) ∼
                                          = Homg(M, N ⊗ V ∗ ),             (1)
where L (M, N) is considered as a g-module under the adjoint action.
    The second statement is the classical positive answer to Kostant’s problem
for projective Verma modules. In [Ja, 6.9] it is shown that
Proposition 3. For every submodule M ⊂ ∆(e) the canonical inclusion
                 U(g)/Ann(∆(e)/M) ֒→ L (∆(e)/M, ∆(e)/M)
is surjective, in particular, the canonical inclusion
                     U(g)/Ann(∆(e)) ֒→ L (∆(e), ∆(e))
is surjective.
   Using the twisting functors we obtain:
Corollary 4. ([Jo2, Corollary 6.4], [Ja, 7.25]) For every w ∈ Wλ the canon-
ical inclusion
                  U(g)/Ann(∆(w)) ֒→ L (∆(w), ∆(w))
is surjective.
Proof. We have the obvious map L (∆(w), ∆(w)) → L (∆(e), ∆(e)) induced
by the inclusion ∆(w) ⊂ ∆(e). Since Ann(∆(w)) = Ann(∆(e)) by [Di,
Theorem 8.4.4], it is enough to show that for every simple finite-dimensional
g-module V we have the equality
       dim Homg(V, L (∆(w), ∆(w))) = dim Homg(V, L (∆(e), ∆(e))).
For this we compute
         Homg(V, L (∆(w), ∆(w)))                        =   (1)
         Homg(∆(w), ∆(w) ⊗ V ∗ )                        =   (IV) and (V)
         Homg(Tw ∆(e), Tw (∆(e)) ⊗ V ∗ )                =   (I)
         Homg(Tw ∆(e), Tw (∆(e) ⊗ V ∗ ))                =
         HomDb (Oλ ) (Tw ∆(e), Tw (∆(e) ⊗ V ∗ ))        =   (II)
         HomDb (Oλ ) (LTw ∆(e), LTw (∆(e) ⊗ V ∗ ))      =   (III)
         HomDb (Oλ ) (∆(e), ∆(e) ⊗ V ∗ )                =
         Homg(∆(e), ∆(e) ⊗ V ∗ )                        =   (1)
         Homg(V, L (∆(e), ∆(e))).
This completes the proof.

                                       5
Proposition 5. Let w ∈ Wλ and
                        0 → X → ∆(w) → Y → 0                             (2)
be a short exact sequence such that for every finite-dimensional g-module V
we have
                         Ext1O (∆(w), X ⊗ V ) = 0.                       (3)
Then the canonical inclusion
                        U(g)/Ann(Y ) ֒→ L (Y, Y )
is surjective.
Proof. Applying Homg(∆(w), − ⊗ V ) to (2) and using (3) yields the short
exact sequence
  0 → Homg(∆(w), X ⊗ V ) → Homg(∆(w), ∆(w) ⊗ V ) →
                                       → Homg(∆(w), Y ⊗ V ) → 0,
which implies that L (∆(w), ∆(w)) surjects onto L (∆(w), Y ), where the
vectorspace L (Y, Y ) is a subspace. Since U(g) surjects onto L (∆(w), ∆(w))
by Corollary 4, the statement follows.
   Now we can prove the classical result of Gabber and Joseph:
Theorem 6. ([GJ, Theorem 4.4], [Ja, 7.32]) Let S ⊂ Bλ and w = wλS wλBλ .
Then the canonical inclusion
                   U(g)/Ann(L(w)) ֒→ L (L(w), L(w))
is surjective.
Proof. Let V be a finite-dimensional g-module. Consider the short exact
sequence
                   0 → K(w) → ∆(w) → L(w) → 0,                      (4)
where K(w) is just the kernel of the canonical projection from ∆(w) to L(w).
Then we have
 Ext1O (∆(w), K(w) ⊗ V )                      =
 HomDb (O) (∆(w), K(w) ⊗ V [1])               = (duals of (IV) and (V))
                      Bλ
 HomDb (O) (GwλS ∆(wλ ), K(w) ⊗ V [1])        = (− ⊗ V is exact
                                                  and preserves projectives)
              ∗            Bλ
 HomDb (O) (V ⊗ GwλS ∆(wλ ), K(w)[1])         = (dual of (I))
                            Bλ
                    ∗
 HomDb (O) (GwλS (V ⊗ ∆(wλ )), K(w)[1])       = (∆(wλBλ ) = ∇(wλBλ ))
 HomDb (O) (GwλS (V ∗ ⊗ ∇(wλBλ )), K(w)[1])   = (dual of (II))
                      ∗       Bλ
 HomDb (O) (RGwλS (V ⊗ ∇(wλ )), K(w)[1]) = (III)
 HomDb (O) (V ∗ ⊗ ∇(wλBλ ), LTwλS K(w)[1]).

                                     6
Let us calculate LTwλS K(w). Because of our choice of wλS we can use Propo-
sition 11, which will be proved in Section 5 (alternatively one can use [GJ,
Section 2]), and [BGG2] to get that the module K(w) admits a BGG-type
resolution, which has the following form:

             0 → X k → X k−1 → · · · → X 1 → X 0 → K(w) → 0,

where every X i is a direct sum of some ∆(xwλBλ ) with x ∈ WλS , x 6= wλS . Let
X • denote the corresponding complex in D b (Oλ ). Using (II) we have

                        LTwλS K(w) = LTwλS X • = TwλS X • .

Now for every x ∈ WλS , x 6= wλS , let y ∈ WλS be such that yx−1 = wλS . Then,
using (IV), (V), and (VI), we have

    TwλS ∆(xwλBλ ) = Ty Tx−1 ∆(xwλBλ ) = Ty ∆(wλBλ ) = Ty ∇(wλBλ ) = ∇(ywλBλ ).

This implies that TwλS X • is a complex of dual Verma modules in Oλ . At the
same time the module ∇(wλBλ ) ⊗ V ∗ ∼         B
                                       = ∆(wλ λ ) ⊗ V ∗ is a tilting module in
Oλ . Hence, by [Ha, Chap. III, Lemma 2.1], the space

                    HomDb (O) (∇(wλBλ ) ⊗ V ∗ , LTwλS K(w)[1])

can be computed already in the homotopy category, where it is obviously
zero, since the only non-zero component of the first complex is in degree zero
and the above computation shows that the zero component of the second
complex is zero. Hence we obtain

                         Ext1O (∆(w), K(w) ⊗ V ) = 0.                             (5)

The statement of our theorem now follows by applying Proposition 5 to the
short exact sequence (4).


4     Proof of Theorem 1: the case S = Bλ
In this section we prove Theorem 1 in the case S = Bλ . Throughout the
section we fix α ∈ Bλ and set s = sα .

Proposition 7. The canonical inclusion U(g)/Ann(L(s)) ֒→ L (L(s), L(s))
is surjective.

    To prove this statement we will need several lemmas.

                                        7
Lemma 8. Let w ∈ Wλ be such that Homg(L(s), θw L(s)) 6= 0. Then w = s
or w = e.
Proof. Assume that w 6= e, s. Let
                         0 → L(s) → X → L(e) → 0                             (6)
be a non-split short exact sequence, which exists because of the Kazhdan-
Lusztig theorem (see for example [Ko, Theorem 1]). Then θw L(e) = 0 since
w 6= e and hence θw X = θw L(s). However, since (6) is non-split, X is a
homomorphic image of ∆(e), and hence θw X is a homomorphic image of
θw ∆(e) = P (w). In particular, θw X is either zero or has simple top L(w).
On the other hand θw L(s) is self-dual and thus θw X = θw L(s) is either zero
or has simple socle L(w). In each of these two cases we have the equality
Homg(L(s), θw L(s)) = 0 since w 6= s. This completes the proof.
   The above result naturally motivates the following question:
  Question. Let S ⊂ Bλ and w ∈ Wλ be such that the vector space
Homg(L(wλS ), θw L(wλS )) is non-zero. Does this imply that w ∈ WλS ?
    Recall that a g-module, M, is called s-finite provided that it is locally
finite over the sl2 -subalgebra of g, which corresponds to s. The module L(w)
is s-finite if and only if w is the minimal coset representative of some coset
from {e, s}\Wλ , that is if and only if sw > w.
    Define F (s) as the minimal submodule of the radical Rad(∆(s)) of ∆(s)
such that the quotient Rad(∆(s))/F (s) is s-finite and consider the short
exact sequence
                         0 → F (s) → ∆(s) → N(s) → 0,                      (7)
where N(s) is the cokernel. Our next step is to prove the following:
Lemma 9. The canonical inclusion U(g)/Ann(N(s)) ֒→ L (N(s), N(s)) is
surjective.
Proof. For every w ∈ Wλ we have
        Ext1O (∆(s), θw F (s))                =
        HomDb (O) (∆(s), θw F (s)[1])         =   (V)
        HomDb (O) (Ts ∆(e), θw F (s)[1])      =   (properties of θw )
        HomDb (O) (θw−1 Ts ∆(e), F (s)[1])    =   (I)
        HomDb (O) (Ts θw−1 ∆(e), F (s)[1])    =
        HomDb (O) (Ts P (w −1), F (s)[1])     =   (II)
        HomDb (O) (LTs P (w −1 ), F (s)[1])   =   (III)
        HomDb (O) (P (w −1), RGs F (s)[1]).   =   (P (w −1) is projective)
        Homg(P (w −1), R1 Gs F (s))           =   (dual of (VIII))
        0.

                                        8
The statement now follows from Corollary 4 and Proposition 5.
   Consider now the short exact sequence
                                           p′
                      0 → X(s) → N(s) −→ L(s) → 0.                         (8)
Lemma 10. For every finite-dimensional g-module V the sequence (8) in-
duces the following isomorphism:
              Homg(N(s), N(s) ⊗ V ) ∼
                                    = Homg(L(s), L(s) ⊗ V ).
Proof. Let 0 6= f ∈ Homg(N(s), N(s)⊗V ). Since N(s) has simple top, f can
not annihilate it. Consider the map (p′ ⊗ id) ◦ f ∈ Homg(N(s), L(s) ⊗ V ).
                                                p′ ⊗id
Since the kernel of the projection N(s) ⊗ V ։ L(s) ⊗ V is s-finite and the
top of N(s) is not, we have (p′ ⊗id)◦f 6= 0. On the other hand, since the socle
of L(s) ⊗ V consists exclusively of s-infinite modules, the map (p′ ⊗ id) ◦ f
must annihilate X(s) and hence it factors through L(s). This implies that
(8) induces the following inclusion:
             Homg(N(s), N(s) ⊗ V ) ֒→ Homg(L(s), L(s) ⊗ V ).
To complete the proof we now have to compare the dimensions and thus it
is enough to show that for every w ∈ Wλ we have
            dim Homg(N(s), θw N(s)) = dim Homg(L(s), θw L(s)).
This is obvious for w = e since both spaces are one-dimensional in this case.
For w = s we have non-zero adjunction morphisms in both spaces, moreover,
the module θs L(s) has simple socle. This implies
          dim Homg(N(s), θs N(s)) = dim Homg(L(s), θs L(s)) = 1.
For w 6= s, e Lemma 8 implies dim Homg(L(s), θw L(s)) = 0. The statement
follows.
   Now we are ready to prove Proposition 7.
Proof of Proposition 7. Since X(s) is s-finite and L(s) is simple and s-infi-
nite, we have L (X(s), L(s)) = 0 by Proposition 2, which implies that (8)
induces the isomorphism L (L(s), L(s)) ∼ = L (N(s), L(s)).
    Since X(s) is s-finite and the top of N(s) is simple and s-infinite, we
have L (N(s), X(s)) = 0 by Proposition 2, which implies that (8) induces
the inclusion L (N(s), N(s)) ֒→ L (N(s), L(s)). However, Lemma 10 and
Proposition 2 show that this inclusion is in fact an isomorphism. Since U(g)
surjects onto L (N(s), N(s)) by Corollary 4, it follows that (8) induces a
surjection of U(g) onto L (L(s), L(s)). This completes the proof.

                                      9
5    Proof of Theorem 1: the general case
In this Section we prove Theorem 1 in the general case. Our approach is
similar to the one we use in Section 4, however, it requires more delicate
arguments in several places, moreover, in some places we will use the reduc-
tion to the case, considered in Section 4. Set s = sα and recall the notation
w = wλS wλBλ .
    Using the equivalence from [So] we can assume that λ is integral. Let
a = a(S) denote the semi-simple Lie subalgebra of g, generated by X±α ,
α ∈ S. If M is a weight g-module with the weight-space decomposition
M = ⊕µ∈h∗ Mµ , and ν ∈ h∗ , then the subspace

                              Maν = ⊕µ∈ν+ZS Mµ

is stable under the action of a and hence is an a-submodule of M. This
induces the functor, which we will denote by Rν , from the category of all
weight g-modules to the category of all weight a-modules, which sends M
to Maν . Let Oa denote the category O for the algebra a. From the PBW
theorem it follows that for every w ∈ Wλ and every ν ∈ h∗ the module
Rν ∆(w) has a finite Verma flag as an a-module, in particular, Rν ∆(w) ∈ Oa.
From this one easily deduces that Rν maps O to Oa.
    Let h⊥ be the orthogonal complement to a ∩ h in h with respect to the
Killing form. Let ξ be the restriction of w · λ to h⊥ . Define the parabolic
induction functor Indga in the following way: for M ∈ Oa let h⊥ act on M via
ξ, and let Xα M = 0 for all positive roots α ∈ R such that Xα 6∈ a. In this way
we can regard M as a module over the parabolic subalgebra p = a + h + n+
of g. We set
                           Indga(M) = U(g) ⊗U (p) M,
which obviously defines a functor from Oa to O. From the PBW theorem it
follows that this functor sends Verma modules to Verma modules. Let ζ be
the restriction of w · λ to a ∩ h. Note that ζ is regular and dominant for a.
    Finally, denote by C the full subcategory of Oλ , which consists of all
modules M, whose all composition factors have the form L(y), y ∈ WλS wλBλ .

Proposition 11. Indga and Rw·λ induce mutually inverse equivalences between
Oζa and C.

Proof. The classical adjunction between the restriction and induction implies
that (Indga, Rw·λ ) is an adjoint pair of functors, which gives us the natural
maps
                   Indga Rw·λ → IdC , and IdOζa → Rw·λ Indga.


                                      10
These maps are obviously isomorphisms on Verma modules, and then by
induction one shows that they are isomorphisms on simple modules. The
statement follows.
   As in Section 4 we define F (w) as the minimal submodule of the radical
Rad(∆(w)) of ∆(w) such that the quotient Rad(∆(w))/F (w) is s-finite and
consider the short exact sequence

                         0 → F (w) → ∆(w) → N(w) → 0,                     (9)

where N(w) is the cokernel.

Proposition 12. The canonical inclusion

                       U(g)/Ann(N(w)) ֒→ L (N(w), N(w))

is surjective.

Proof. Let w ∈ Wλ . Using the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 9
we obtain

                 Ext1O (∆(w), θw F (w)) = Ext1O (θw−1 ∆(w), Gs F (w)).

Let us prove that the last space is zero. For this we will need the following
statement:
Lemma 13. All simple subquotients of Gs F (w) are of the form L(x), x ∈
WλS wλBλ .
Proof. Using the left exactness of Gs it is enough to prove that for every
y ∈ WλS wλBλ all simple subquotients of Gs L(y) are of the form L(x), x ∈
WλS wλBλ . By (VII), we can even assume sy < y. Applying Gs to the short
exact sequence
                      0 → K(y) → ∆(y) → L(y) → 0
and using the dual of (VI) we obtain the following exact sequence:

          0 → Gs K(y) → Gs ∆(y) (∼
                                 = ∆(sy)) → Gs L(y) → L1 Gs K(y).

Obviously all simple subquotients of ∆(sy) have the necessary form and from
the dual of (VIII) it follows that all simple subquotients of L1 Gs K(y) have
the necessary form as well. The statement follows.




                                          11
    We have θw−1 ∆(w) ∈ Fλ (∆). Let Q1 = ⊕x∈W \W S wBλ P (x) and consider
                                                  λ  λ λ
the trace Z (i.e. the sum of the images of all homomorphism) of Q1 in
θw−1 ∆(w). Since the extensions between the Verma modules are directed, it
follows by induction that all modules in the short exact sequence
                     0 → Z → θw−1 ∆(w) → Coker → 0
have Verma flags, moreover, the Verma modules, occurring as subquotients of
Z, have the form ∆(x), x ∈ Wλ \ WλS wλBλ , and the Verma modules, occurring
as subquotients of Coker, have the form ∆(y), y ∈ WλS wλBλ . Since for every
x ∈ Wλ \ WλS wλBλ and y ∈ WλS wλBλ we have x 6≤ y with respect to the Bruhat
order, for all such x and y we obtain
                           Ext1O (∆(x), L(y)) = 0,
which, because of Lemma 13, yields
                           Ext1O (Z, Gs F (w)) = 0.
    Now let us consider the module Coker ∈ C. We claim that Rw·λ Coker is a
projective module in the category Oζa. Indeed, the module ∆(w) is obtained
by the parabolic induction from some projective Verma a-module. Since
the adjoint action of a on U(g) is locally finite, it follows that Rν (∆(w))
is projective in Oζa for every ν ∈ h∗ . Further, for every finite-dimensional
g-module V we have
                Rw·λ (V ⊗ ∆(w)) = ⊕(ν1 ,ν2) Rν1 V ⊗ Rν2 ∆(w),
where the sum is taken over all pairs (ν1 , ν2 ) ∈ h∗ × h∗ with different h⊥ -
restrictions of ν1 such that ν1 + ν2 = w · λ. In particular, Rw·λ (V ⊗ ∆(w))
is projective in Oζa. The inductive construction of the Verma flag in [BGG1]
implies that
                       Rw·λ (Coker) = R0 V ⊗ Rw·λ ∆(w),
which is also projective in Oζa. In particular, the first extension between
Rw·λ(Coker) and all simple a-modules in Oζa vanishes and hence from Propo-
sition 11 we derive
                           Ext1O (Coker, L(y)) = 0
for all y ∈ WλS wλBλ . Therefore, using Lemma 13 we get
                         Ext1O (Coker, Gs F (w)) = 0.
   Thus
                       Ext1O (θw−1 ∆(w), Gs F (w)) = 0
and the statement of the proposition follows from Corollary 4 and Proposi-
tion 5.

                                     12
   Consider now the short exact sequence
                                           p̂
                    0 → X(w) → N(w) −→ L(w) → 0.                         (10)

Lemma 14. For every finite-dimensional g-module V the sequence (10) in-
duces the isomorphism

            Homg(N(w), N(w) ⊗ V ) ∼
                                  = Homg(L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ).

Proof. The same arguments as in Lemma 10 show that (10) induces the
inclusion

           Homg(N(w), N(w) ⊗ V ) ֒→ Homg(L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ).

Let f ∈ Homg(L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ). We would like to lift f to an element in the
space Homg(N(w), N(w) ⊗ V ). For this we consider the auxiliary module
Gs L(w).
Lemma 15. Ext1O (Gs L(w), L(x)) = 0 for each s-finite L(x).
Proof. This follows from [AS, Theorem 6.3(3)] and the Kazhdan-Lusztig the-
orem (observe that in [AS, Theorem 6.3(3)] one has to assume that L′ is
s-finite).
  First of all we claim that Gs L(w) surjects onto N(w). Indeed, applying
Homg(Gs L(w), − ) to (10) and using Lemma 15 we obtain the surjection

              Homg(Gs L(w), N(w)) ։ Homg(Gs L(w), L(w)).

Using this surjection we can lift the canonical projection p̃ : Gs L(w) ։ L(w)
to obtain the short exact sequence
                                          q
                    0 → Ker → Gs L(w) −→ N(w) → 0.                       (11)

   Applying Homg(Gs L(w), − ⊗ V ) to (10) and using Lemma 15 we obtain
the surjection

          Homg(Gs L(w), N(w) ⊗ V ) ։ Homg(Gs L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ).

In particular, we can lift the map f ◦ p̂ ◦ q ∈ Homg(Gs L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ) to
some map f ∈ Homg(Gs L(w), N(w) ⊗ V ).
    Now recall that Gs L(w) ∈ C by Lemma 13. Applying Rw·λ and using
Proposition 11 and Lemma 10 we obtain that Rw·λ (f ) annihilates the mod-
ule Rw·λ (Ker), which implies that f annihilates Ker by Proposition 11. In
particular, f factors through N(w). Since all the modules L(w), N(w), and

                                     13
Gs L(w), have same simple top, it follows that f 6= 0 if and only if f 6= 0.
This gives us the injection
            Homg(L(w), L(w) ⊗ V ) ֒→ Homg(N(w), N(w) ⊗ V ),
and the statement follows.
    Now we have the same amount of information as at the end of Section 4
and hence the proof of Theorem 1 can be easily completed in the same way
as the proof of Proposition 7.
Proof of Theorem 1. Mutatis mutandis the proof of Proposition 7.


6     Application to α-stratified simple modules
For c ∈ C denote by Θcs = Θcαs Mathieu’s twisting functor from [Ma, 4.3].
Corollary 16. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1 we have that the canon-
ical injection
                 U(g)/Ann(Θcs L(w)) ֒→ L (Θcs L(w), Θcs L(w))
is surjective. Moreover, for every w ∈ Wλ the canonical injection
                 U(g)/Ann(Θcs ∆(w)) ֒→ L (Θcs ∆(w), Θcs ∆(w))
is surjective.
Proof. From the definition of Θcs it follows that Θcs preserves Ann(M) and in-
duces an isomorphism between L (M, M) and L (Θcs M, Θcs M) for any M ∈ O
on which X−α acts injectively. The first statement now follows from Theo-
rem 1 and the second one from Corollary 4.
    When the modules Θcs L(w) are simple, they are simple αs -stratified mod-
ules considered in [CF, FM]. The modules Θcs ∆(w) are proper standard ob-
jects in the parabolic generalization of O studied in [FKM] (see also [Maz]).
