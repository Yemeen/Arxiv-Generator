                                                     Abstract. We show that the two cuspidal unipotent characters of a finite
                                                     Chevalley group E7 (q) have Schur index 2, provided that q is an even power
                                                     of a (sufficiently large) prime number p such that p ≡ 1 mod 4. The proof
                                                     uses a refinement of Kawanaka’s generalized Gelfand–Graev representations
                                                     and some explicit computations with the CHEVIE computer algebra system.




                                                                                1. Introduction
                                                 Throughout this paper, let G be a simple algebraic group of adjoint type E7 .
                                             Assume that G is defined over the finite field Fq , with corresponding Frobenius map
                                             F : G → G. There are√precisely two cuspidal unipotent characters of GF denoted
                                             by E7 [±ξ] where ξ = −q; see the table in [2], §13.9.
                                                 The purpose of this paper is to determine the Schur index of E7 [±ξ], at least if
                                             the characteristic of Fq is large enough. Modulo this condition on the characteristic,
                                             this completes the determination of the Schur indices of the unipotent characters
                                             of finite groups of Lie type; see [12], [5] and the references there.
                                                 By [4], Table 1, the character values of E7 [±ξ] generate the field Q(ξ). Further-
                                             more, by [4], Example 6.4, we already know that the Schur index is 1 if p 6≡ 1 mod 4
                                             or if q is not a square, where p is the characteristic of Fq . Thus, the remaining task
                                             is to determine the Schur index when q is a square and p ≡ 1 mod 4.
                                             Theorem 1.1. Assume that q is an even power of a (sufficiently large) prime p
                                             such that p ≡ 1 mod 4. Then the characters E7 [±ξ] have Schur index 2.
                                                Here, p is “sufficiently large” if Lusztig’s results [11] on generalized Gelfand–
                                             Graev characters hold; it is conjectured that this is the case if p is good for G.
                                                The idea of the proof is as follows. We have already seen in [5], §4, that E7 [±ξ]
                                             occur with multiplicity 1 in a generalized Gelfand–Graev character Γu , where u is a
                                             certain unipotent element in G. Here, we shall use a refinement of the construction
                                             of Γu to show that, under the given assumptions on p and q, the characters E7 [±ξ]
                                             occur with odd multiplicity in an induced character which cannot be realized over
                                             Q(ξ). By standard arguments on Schur indices, this implies that E7 [±ξ] cannot be
                                             realized over Q(ξ). At some stage, the proof relies on the fact that, in Lusztig’s
                                             parametrization of the irreducible characters of GF , the function ∆ occurring in
                                             [10], Main Theorem 4.23, takes value −1 on the labels corresponding to E7 [±ξ].
                                                Furthermore, we rely on some explicit computations in GF . However, we shall
                                             only use computations with the root system and the irreducible characters of the
                                             Weyl group of G, for which the CHEVIE system [6] is a convenient tool.

        2. Generalized Gelfand–Graev characters for type E7
   A short summary of the construction of generalized Gelfand–Graev characters
is given in [5], §2. Assume that q is a power of a “good” prime p 6= 2, 3. Let Φ
be the root system of G with respect to a fixed maximally split torus T . Let C
be the unipotent class of G whose weighted Dynkin diagram d : Φ → Z is given in
Table 1. (The notation in that table also defines a labelling of the simple roots in
the root system of G.) The class C is the “unipotent support” of the two cuspidal
unipotent characters of GF ; see [5], §4, and the references there.
        Table 1. The weighted Dynkin diagram for the unipotent support
        of the cuspidal unipotent characters in type E7

                      1             0         1         0         1        0
             E7        ✇             ✇         ✇         ✇         ✇        ✇
                      α1            α3   α4             α5        α6       α7


                                         0     ✇ α2

   Given the weight function d : Φ → Z specified by the diagram in Table 1, we
define unipotent subgroups
                         Y                            Y
                 Ud,2 :=      Xα     and     Ud,1 :=       Xα ,
                           α∈Φ+                               α∈Φ+
                           d(α)>2                             d(α)>1


where Xα is the root subgroup in G corresponding to the root α. (It is understood
that the products are taken in some fixed order.) The generalized Gelfand–Graev
character associated with an element in C F is obtained by inducing a certain linear
character from Ud,2F
                     . We have CG (u)/CG (u)◦ ∼ = Z/2Z for u ∈ C. Thus, C F splits
into two classes in the finite group GF . By Mizuno [13], Lemma 28, representatives
of these two GF -classes are given by
                y74 = x20 (1)x21 (1)x23 (1)x28 (1)x31 (1),
                y75 = x20 (1)x21 (1)x28 (1)x24 (1)x23 (1)x25 (1)x36 (ζ),
where ζ is a generator for the multiplicative group of Fq and where the subscripts
correspond to the following roots in Φ+ :
       20 : α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 ,               21 : α1 + α3 + α4 + α5 ,
       23 : α2 + α4 + α5 + α6 ,               24 : α3 + α4 + α5 + α6 ,
       25 : α4 + α5 + α6 + α7 ,               28 : α2 + α3 + 2α4 + α5 ,
       31 : α3 + α4 + α5 + α6 + α7 ,          36 : α2 + α3 + α4 + α5 + α6 + α7 .
(Attention: Here, we use the labelling of the roots as given by the CHEVIE system
[6], which is slightly different from that of Mizuno.) We note that both y74 and y75
             F
lie in C ∩ Ud,2 . Now let us fix
                                                      F
                              u ∈ {y74 , y75 } ⊆ C ∩ Ud,2 ;
the above expressions show that
                            Y
                       u=       xα (ηα )            where ηα ∈ Fq .
                             α∈Φ+
                             d(α)=2

Then we define a linear character ϕu : Ud,2 → C× by the formula
              Y                  X              
          ϕu         xα (ξα ) = χ         cα ηα ξα    for all ξα ∈ Fq ,
                 α∈Φ+                      α∈Φ+
                 d(α)>2                    d(α)=2


where cα ∈ Fq are certain fixed constants (independent of the ηα and ξα ) and where
χ : F+
     q → C
            ×
               is a fixed non-trivial character of the additive group of Fq ; see [5],
Definition 2.1, for more details. It will actually be convenient to choose χ in the
following special way. Let χ0 : F+ p → C
                                           ×
                                             be a fixed non-trivial character of the
additive group of Fp . Then we take χ to be
                                       χ := χ0 ◦ TrFq /Fp
where TrFq /Fp : F+    +
                  q → Fp is the trace map. Now we have
                             F     
                        IndG             F    F 1/2
                           U F ϕu = [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ]  · Γu ,
                                 d,2


where Γu is the generalized Gelfand–Graev character associated with u. We have
seen in [5], Corollary 4.3, that
                 
            
                  E7 [±ξ], Γu GF = 1  for suitable u ∈ {y74 , y75 }.
(Here, and throughout the paper, we denote by h , iA the standard inner product
on the character ring of a finite group A.)
  We will now refine the construction of Γu . The strategy for doing this has already
been outlined in [5], §4. For this purpose, we shall assume from now on that
                                  q is an even power of p.
Since G is simple of adjoint type, we have an Fq -isomorphism
                  ×
             h: k     · · × k ×} → T,
                | × ·{z                          (x1 , . . . , x7 ) 7→ h(x1 , . . . , x7 ),
                     7 factors

such that αi (h(x1 , . . . , x7 )) = xi for 1 6 i 6 7. In particular, we have T F =
{h(x1 , . . . , x7 ) | xi ∈ F×
                             q }. We shall set

                          t := h(ν 1/2 , 1, 1, ν 1/2 , 1, ν 1/2 , 1) ∈ T F
as in the proof of [5], Lemma 4.1, where ν is a generator for the multiplicative
group of Fp ⊂ Fq and ν 1/2 is a square root of ν in Fq . (The square root exists
since q is an even power of p.) Then t has the property that α(t) = ν for all roots
α involved in the expressions for y74 or y75 as products of root subgroup elements;
furthermore, we have α(t) = 1 for all roots α such that d(α) = 0. The element t
has order 2(p − 1) and H := hti normalizes Ud,2 . We set
                     s1 := h(−1, 1, 1, −1, 1, −1, 1) = tp−1 ∈ T F .
Note that α(s1 ) = 1 for all roots α ∈ Φ+ which are involved in the expressions of
y74 and y75 as products of root subgroup elements. Thus, s1 fixes the character
                                   F
ϕu and so we can extend ϕu to Ud,2   .hs1 i. Actually, there are two such extensions
                               ′
which we denote by ϕ̃u and ϕ̃u . Their values are determined by
       ϕ̃u (xs1 ) = ϕu (x)       and        ϕ̃′u (xs1 ) = −ϕu (x)                         F
                                                                             for all x ∈ Ud,2 .

The following result provides some crucial information concerning ψu and ψu′ .

Proposition 2.2. Recall that q is an even power of p. Then, with the above
notation, the following hold.
    (a) Both ψu and ψu′ are irreducible characters of Ud,2
                                                         F
                                                           .H.
    (b) ψu can be realized over Q.
    (c) ψu′ is rational-valued but cannot be realized over Q. In fact, ψu′ has non-
        trivial local Schur indices at ∞ and at the prime p.

Proof. (See also the argument of Ohmori [14], p. 154.) Let

where ξα ∈ Fq . Then, as in the proof of [5], Proposition 2.3, we have

                       ϕu (ti xt−i ) = χ(ν i γx )              for 1 6 i 6 2(p − 1).

In particular, this implies StabH (ϕu ) = hs1 i. Hence, by Clifford theory, the induced

  Next we prove (b). Using Mackey’s formula and relation (1), we have that

                       i=1

In particular, this shows that the values are rational integers. Thus, ψu + ψu′ is
rational-valued. Now assume, if possible, that ψu is not rational-valued. Then the
characters ψu and ψu′ must be algebraically conjugate. Consequently, ψu and ψu′
occur with the same multiplicity in every rational-valued character. Now, by the

since ϕ̃′u (s1 ) = −1. (Here, the symbol 1 stands for the unit character.) By a similar
argument, since ϕ̃u (s1 ) = 1, we also have

Thus, ψu and ψu′ do not occur with the same multiplicity in some rational-valued
character, a contradiction. Thus, our assumption was wrong and so both ψu and
ψu′ are rational-valued. But then the above multiplicity 1 formula implies that ψu
can be realized over Q, by a standard argument concerning Schur indices (see Isaacs
[8], Corollary 10.2).
    Finally, we prove (c). We begin by showing that the local Schur index at ∞ is
non-trivial. In other words, we must show that ψu′ cannot be realized over R. For
this purpose, by a well-known criterion due to Frobenius and Schur (see Isaacs [8],
Chapter 4), it is enough to show that
                               1      X
                              F
                                           ψu′ (g 2 ) = −1.

Now, in order to evaluate the above sum, we note that
                               1     X

                           |Ud,2      F      g∈Ud,2 .H

since ψu can be realized over Q. Thus, it will be enough to show that

           F                                     F
Let g ∈ Ud,2 .H and write g = xh where x ∈ Ud,2      and h ∈ H. Now the value of
the above induced character on g 2 is zero unless g 2 ∈ Ud,2
                                                         F
                                                             . Thus, we only need to
consider elements g = xh where h = 1 or h = s1 . So we must show that

                                                        ϕu (xs1 xs1 ) = 0.

               F
Now, since Ud,2    has odd order, the map x 7→ x2 defines a bijection of Ud,2    F
                                                                                     onto
itself. Hence the first sum evaluates to

                                                                                = 0.
                                                                                  Ud,2 .H
        F
     x∈Ud,2

Now consider the second sum. For this purpose, we note that α(s1 ) = 1 for all
roots α ∈ Φ+ which are involved in the expressions of y74 and y75 as products of
6                                             Geck


root subgroup elements. Thus, if x and γx are as in (1), then we have
                            X
                 γ(xs1 )2 =     cα ηα (α(s1 ) + 1)ξα = 2γx = γx2 .
                              α∈Φ+
                              d(α)=2


Using once more Mackey’s formula as at the beginning of this proof, we see that

             F
for all x ∈ Ud,2 . Consequently, the second sum also equals 0. Thus, we have shown
        ′
that ψu cannot be realized over R. We shall now use some general properties of
Schur indices; see Feit [3], §2, for references. First, since ψu′ is rational-valued but
ψu′ cannot be realized over R, the Schur index of ψu′ is 2 (by the Brauer–Speiser
theorem; see [3], 2.4). Furthermore, there exists at least one prime number ℓ such
that the ℓ-local Schur index of ψu′ is 2 (by the Hasse sum formula; see [3], 2.15).
Thus, it will be enough to show that the ℓ-local Schur index of ψu′ is 1, for every
prime ℓ 6= p. Let ℓ be such a prime. If ℓ 6= 2, then ψu′ is a character of ℓ-defect 0
     F
of Ud,2 .H. So the ℓ-local Schur index is 1 by [3], 2.10. Finally, if ℓ = 2, then ψu′
is a character of 2-defect 1 and, hence, lies in a block with a cyclic defect group of
order 2. Consequently, that block contains only two irreducible characters and so
ψu′ remains irreducible as a 2-modular Brauer character. This implies again that
the local Schur index is 1; see [3], 2.10.                                            

                          3. A subgroup of type D6 × A1
   Our next aim is to compute the multiplicity of E7 [±ξ] in Γ̃u and Γ̃′u ; see Def-
inition 2.1. We already know that the multiplicity of E7 [±ξ] in the sum Γ̃u + Γ̃′u
          F     F 1/2
equals [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] , for suitable u ∈ {y74 , y75 }. We shall now try to compute the
multiplicity in the difference Γ̃u − Γ̃′u . For this purpose, we take a closer look at
the semisimple element s1 and its centralizer. Let
         G1 := hT, Xα | α ∈ Φ1 i         where         Φ1 := {α ∈ Φ | α(s1 ) = 1}.
Using the CHEVIE function ReflectionSubgroup, we check that the root system
Φ1 has type D6 × A1 ; a system of simple roots in Φ1 is given by
                          Π1 = {α2 , α3 , α5 , α7 , α14 , α18 , α28 }
where
        α14 := α1 +α3 +α4 ,     α18 := α4 +α5 +α6 ,        α28 := α2 +α3 +2α4 +α5 .
(Here, the numbering of the roots is the same as that given by CHEVIE.) The
corresponding Dynkin diagram and the restriction of the weight function d to Π1
are given in Table 2. Furthermore, one can check, using CHEVIE (for example),
that
                     NW (W1 ) = {w ∈ W | w(Φ1 ) ⊆ Φ1 } = W1
where W1 := hwα | α ∈ Φ1 i ⊂ W is the Weyl group of G1 (and where we denote by
wβ the reflection with root β, for any root β ∈ Φ).
Lemma 3.1. We have CG (s1 ) = G1 ; in particular, CG (s1 ) is connected.
                      Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters of E7 (q)         7


Proof. By Carter [2], § 3.5, we have CG (s1 )◦ = G1 . Hence, G1 is a normal subgroup
in CG (s1 ). So it is enough to show that NG (G1 ) = G1 . Let g ∈ NG (G1 ). Then
gT g −1 is a maximal torus in G1 and so there exists some g1 ∈ G1 such that
gT g −1 = g1 T g1−1 . Thus, we have g1−1 g ∈ NG (T ) and so g ∈ G1 .NG (T ). Hence, we
may assume without loss of generality that g ∈ NG (T ) ∩ NG (G1 ). Now, for any
g ∈ NG (T ) ∩ NG (G1 ) and any α ∈ Φ1 , we have gXα g −1 = Xw(α) ⊆ G1 , where w is
the image of g in W = NG (T )/T . Thus, we have w(Φ1 ) ⊆ Φ1 and so w ∈ W1 (see
the above remarks). This implies g ∈ G1 , as required.                               

   Let C1 be the conjugacy class of y74 in G1 and denote by d1 : Φ1 → Z the
corresponding weighted Dynkin diagram. Using the identification results in [1],
Theorem 11.3.2, it is straightforward to check that, under the natural matrix rep-
resentation of a group of type D6 × A1 , the elements y74 and y75 correspond to
matrices with Jordan blocks of size 1, 1, 2, 5, 5 (where the block of size 2 comes
from the A1 -factor). Hence, using [2], §13.1, we see that d1 is given by the restric-
tion of d to Φ1 , as specified in Table 2. Furthermore, we notice that the above roots
can all be written as sums of roots in Π1 . Thus, we have
                                    y74 , y75 ∈ C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 ,
where Ud1 ,2 is the unipotent subgroup of G1 defined with respect to d1 .
Lemma 3.2. Let u ∈ {y74 , y75 }. Then we have dim B1u = 4 (where B1u denotes
the variety of Borel subgroups of G1 containing u) and
                                       = CG (u)/CG (u)◦ ∼
                      CG1 (u)/CG1 (u)◦ ∼                = Z/2Z.
Proof. Let u := y74 . The formula for dim B1u follows from [2], §13.1. To prove the
remaining statements, we note that
            s1 ∈ S := {h(x, x−2 , x−2 , x3 , x−2 , x, 1) | x ∈ k × } ⊆ CG1 (u).
Furthermore, one checks that Z(G1 ) = {t ∈ T | α(t) = 1 for all α ∈ Φ1 } = hs1 i.
Thus, since S is connected, we have Z(G1 ) ⊆ CG1 (u)◦ .
   Now let π : G1 → H1 be the adjoint quotient of G1 , where H1 is a semisimple
group of adjoint type D6 × A1 . Let ū be the image of u in H1 . Then, by Carter [2],
§13.1, we know that CH1 (ū)/CH1 (ū)◦ ∼
                                       = Z/2Z. Furthermore, π induces a surjective
homomorphism
                   CG1 (u)/CG1 (u)◦ ։ CH1 (ū)/CH1 (ū)◦ ∼
                                                         = Z/2Z
with kernel given by the image of Z(G1 ) in CG1 (u)/CG1 (u)◦ . Since Z(G1 ) ⊆

Proposition 3.3. Let u ∈ {y74 , y75 } ⊆ C ∩ Ud,2 . Then, as we already noted, we
                 F
have u ∈ C1 ∩ Ud1 ,2 and so the corresponding generalized Gelfand–Graev character
Γ1u of GF
        1 is well-defined. We have

              Γ̃u (ys1 ) − Γ̃′u (ys1 ) = Γ1u (y)           for all y ∈ GF
                                                                        1 unipotent.

where z runs over a set of representatives of the (Ud,2 .hs1 i, GF
                                                                 1 )-double cosets of G .

Let us fix such a double coset representative, z say. Assume that the value at ys1 of
the corresponding induced character in the above sum is non-zero. Then ys1 must
be GF                                                   F        z      F

               F
s1 must be G1 -conjugate to an element in that subgroup. Since hs1 i is a Sylow
                  F                                                        F

       1 and some x ∈ Ud,2 . Consequently, x

z ∈ xG1 c ∈ Ud,2 .G1 . Thus, z represents the trivial double coset and so we can
take z = 1. Using the fact that

                               Ud,2 .hs1 i ∩ GF    F
                                              1 = Ud1 ,2 × hs1 i

(where Ud1 ,2 ⊆ G1 is the unipotent subgroup defined with respect to the weighted
Dynkin diagram d1 : Φ1 → Z) we find that
                                     GF                      

where  ϕ1u denotes the restriction of ϕu to UdF1 ,2 . Since s1 is in the center of G1 , it
is readily checked that

By a completely analogous argument, we also obtain that

Thus, it remains to check that

                                      Γ1u = IndU F1 ϕ1u .
                                                       d1 ,2


For this purpose, we must show that                ϕ1u
                                             indeed is the linear character of UdF1 ,2
required in the definition of Γu . Now, the definition of Γ1u requires the choice of a
                                1

non-degenerate bilinear form and of an oppisition automorphism on the Lie algebra
of G1 . However, the Lie algebra of G1 is naturally contained in the Lie algebra of
G, with compatible Cartan decompositions. Thus, the chosen bilinear form and the
chosen opposition automorphism restrict to the Lie algebra of G1 , and this implies
that ϕ1u is the required linear character of UdF1 ,2 .                              
  A formula of this kind has been stated (without proof) by Kawanaka in [9],
Lemma 2.3.5; see also the Ph. D. thesis of Wings [16], §3.2.1.

Remark 3.4. Let g ∈ GF and write g = gs gu = gu gs where gs ∈ GF is semisimple
and gu ∈ GF is unipotent. Assume that gs is not conjugate to s1 in GF . Then we
have
                                   (Γ̃u − Γ̃′u )(g) = 0.
Indeed, if the value is non-zero, then g must be GF -conjugate to an element in
  F
Ud,2 .hs1 i. But then gs will also be GF -conjugate to an element in that subgroup.
Using a Sylow argument as in the above proof, we see that either gs = 1 or gs is
GF -conjugate to s1 , as claimed. Furthermore, if gs = 1, then it is readily checked
that Γ̃u (g) = Γ̃′u (g).
   Thus, in order to compute the scalar product of E7 [±ξ] with Γ̃u − Γ̃′u , it will be
enough to know the values of E7 [±ξ] on elements of the form ys1 where y ∈ GF         1
is unipotent. Furthermore, since E7 [ξ] and E7 [−ξ] are complex conjugate and
since Γ̃u and Γ̃′u are rational-valued, it will actually be enough to consider the sum
E7 [ξ] + E7 [−ξ]. Now, by Lusztig [10], Main Theorem 4.23, we have
                           E7 [ξ] + E7 [−ξ] = R512a − R512′a .
(Note that the function ∆ occurring in [10], 4.23, takes value −1 on the labels
corresponding to the characters E7 [±ξ].) Here, 512a , 512′a are the two irreducible
characters of W of degree 512 and R512a , R512′a are the corresponding “almost
characters”, as defined by Lusztig [10], (3.7). For any φ ∈ Irr(W ), we have
                                    1 X

here, Tw ⊆ G is an F -stable maximal torus obtained from T by twisting with w
and RTw ,1 is the Deligne–Lusztig generalized character associated with the trivial
character of TwF . Similarly, for any ψ ∈ Irr(W1 ), we denote by Rψ

         1 be a unipotent element. Then we have

Proof. The character formula for RTw ,1 (see [2], Theorem 7.2.8) shows that

Now, we have φ(w) = φ(w1 ) and |CW (w)| = |CW (w1 )| for all w1 ∈ W1 such that
w ∼ w1 . Thus, we have

Writing φ(w1 ) =     ψ    m(φ, ψ)ψ(w1 ), we obtain the desired expression.          

Proof. Immediate from Proposition 3.3, Remark 3.4 and Lemma 3.5.                    
   We now need some explicit information concerning the restriction of characters
from W to W1 . Using the CHEVIE function InductionTable, we compute that
     ResW
        W1 (512a ) ⊗ ε = ([21, 3] ⊠ 1) + sum of ψ where ψ ∈ Irr(W1 ) and aψ > 4,

     ResW      ′
        W1 (512a ) ⊗ ε = ([2, 31] ⊠ 1) + sum of ψ where ψ ∈ Irr(W1 ) and aψ > 4.

Here, 1 denotes the unit character on the A1 -factor of W1 and ε denotes the sign
character of W1 . The characters of the D6 -factor are denoted by [λ, µ] where λ and
µ are partitions such that |λ| + |µ| = 6. The a-invariant of a character is defined as
in Lusztig [10], (4.1); in CHEVIE, these a-invariants are obtained by the function
LowestPowerGenericDegrees. We have
                  aψ = 4        for ψ = [21, 3] ⊠ 1 and ψ = [2, 31] ⊠ 1.
With these explicit formulas, we can now prove the following result.
Proposition 3.7. Assume that the characteristic p is large enough, such that
Lusztig’s formula in [11], Theorem 7.5, for the values of a generalized Gelfand–
Graev holds for Γ1u . By [5], Corollary 4.3, there exists some u ∈ {y74 , y75 } such
that hE7 [±ξ], Γu iGF = 1. For this element u, we have
                            
                   
                             E7 [±ξ], Γ̃u − Γ̃′u GF = −1.
Proof. We have already mentioned in the remarks preceding Lemma 3.5 that
                             E7 [ξ] + E7 [−ξ] = R512a − R512′a .
Since Γ̃u and Γ̃′u are rational-valued (see Proposition 2.2), we have
              
                         1
                          
                E7 [±ξ], Γ̃u − Γ̃′u GF = E7 [ξ] + E7 [−ξ], Γ̃u − Γ̃′u GF
                                         2
                                         1
                         
                                       = R512a − R512′a , Γ̃u − Γ̃′u GF .
                                         2
Now let ψ ∈ Irr(W1 ) be a constituent in the restriction of 512a or 512′a from W
to W1 . Then, by Corollary 3.6, we must compute the scalar product hRψ , Γ1u iGF1 .
Let D denote the Alvis–Curtis–Kawanaka duality operation on the character ring
of GF
    1 ; see Lusztig [10], (6.8). We have D(Rψ ) = Rψ⊗ε and so

               hRψ , Γ1u iGF1 = hD(Rψ ), D(Γ1u )iGF1 = hRψ⊗ε , D(Γ1u )iGF1 .
                    Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters of E7 (q)          11


Now, in order to evaluate the above scalar product, it is enough to know the values
of Rψ⊗ε on the unipotent elements of GF    1 . By Shoji’s algorithm [15] and by [11],
Corollary 10.9, we know that Rψ⊗ε (y) = 0 if dim B1y < aψ⊗ε . On the other hand,
we have D(Γ1u )(y) = 0 if dim B1u < dim B1y . (This follows from [11]; see the remarks
in [4], (2.4).) Thus, the above scalar product is zero if aψ⊗ε > dim B1u = 4. Taking
into account the explicit information concerning the restrictions of 512a and 512′a
from W to W1 , we conclude that
              
                       1

Now [21, 3] ⊠ 1 and [2, 31] ⊠ 1 lie in the same family of characters of W1 ; see [10],
Chapter 4. The Fourier matrix (which has size 4 × 4) for that family shows that
                           R[21,3]⊠1 − R[2,31]⊠1 = −ρ1 − ρ2
where ρ1 and ρ2 are unipotent characters of GF  1 . Now, we can explicitly compute the
unipotent support of these two characters; see [11], §11, or [7], §3.C. This involves
the knowledge of the Springer correspondence for G1 . Using the description of that
correspondence in [2], §13.3, we find that ρ1 and ρ2 have unipotent support C1 .
Thus, by the formula in [7], Remark 3.8, we have
      
                              
                     
(2)    ρi , D(Γ1y74 ) + D(Γ1y75 ) GF = D(ρi ), Γ1y74 + Γ1y75 GF = 1 for i = 1, 2.
                                    1                               1

Note that CG1 (y74 )/CG1 (y74 )◦ ∼ = Z/2Z by Lemma 3.2 and that D(ρ1 ), D(ρ2 ) are
actual characters in the present situation; see [10], (6.8.2). Now we have u ∈
{y74 , y75 } and we would like to show that
                  
                 
           
(3)                 D(ρi ), Γ1u GF = ρi , D(Γ1u ) GF = 1 for i = 1, 2.
                                1                      1

This can be seen as follows. Fix i ∈ {1, 2}. Since D(ρi ) is an actual character, we
certainly have hD(ρi ), Γ1u iGF1 > 0. Hence, using (2), the latter scalar product equals
0 or 1. Assume, if possible, that the scalar product is zero. Then the scalar product
of −ρ1 − ρ2 with DG (Γ1u ) would be −1 or 0. Consequently, the scalar product in
(1) would be −1/2 or 0. Thus, the only possibility is that the scalar product in (1)
equals 0. But this would mean that
      
                                        
            
       E7 [±ξ], Γ̃u + Γ̃′u GF = [Ud,1
                                   F     F 1/2
                                      : Ud,2 ]                         F
                                                  E7 [±ξ], Γu GF = [Ud,1     F 1/2
                                                                          : Ud,2 ]
is an even number, which is not true. So, our assumption was wrong and (3) holds.
Inserting this into (1), we obtain the desired result.                         

                             4. Proof of Theorem 1.1
  By [5], Corollary 4.3, the Schur index of E7 [±ξ] is at most 2. Hence, we only
need to show that E7 [±ξ] cannot be realized over Q(ξ). Now, we have
                 hE7 [±ξ], Γu iGF = 1         for suitable u ∈ {y74 , y75 }.
So, using the formulas in Definition 2.1, we obtain that
          hE7 [±ξ], Γ̃u + Γ̃′u iGF = [Ud,1
                                       F      F 1/2
                                           : Ud,2 ] = qm           for some m > 1.
Combining this with Proposition 3.7 and using Frobenius reciprocity, this yields

Since p ≡ 1 mod 4, we also have q ≡ 1 mod 4 and so the above scalar product is
an odd number. Now assume, if possible, that E7 [±ξ] can be realized over Q(ξ).
                                     F
Then the restriction of E7 [±ξ] to Ud,2 .H can also be realized over Q(ξ). Thus, by
a standard argument on Schur induces ([8], Corollary 10.2), the Schur index of ψu′
over Q(ξ) divides the above odd number. Since the Schur index of ψu′ over Q(ξ) is
                                         be one. Thus, ψu′ can be realized over Q(ξ).
at most 2 (see Proposition 2.2), it must √
Now, √since q is a square, we have ξ = −1. Furthermore, since p ≡ 1 mod 4, we
have −1 ∈ Qp (the field of p-adic numbers). Hence ψu′ can be realized over Qp ,
contradicting Proposition 2.2(c). Thus, our assumption was wrong and so E7 [±ξ]
cannot be realized over Q(ξ).
