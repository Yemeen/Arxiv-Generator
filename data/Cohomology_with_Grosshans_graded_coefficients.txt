                                                      Cohomology with Grosshans graded
                                                                coefficients
                                                                     Wilberd van der Kallen

                                                                               Abstract
                                                      Let the reductive group G act on the finitely generated commuta-
                                                  tive k-algebra A. We ask if the finite generation property of the ring
                                                  of invariants AG extends to the full cohomology ring H ∗ (G, A). We
                                                  confirm this for G = SL2 and also when the action on A is replaced by
                                                  the ‘contracted’ action on the Grosshans graded ring gr A, provided
                                                  the characteristic of k is large.


                                             1    Introduction
                                             Consider a linear algebraic group or group scheme G defined over an al-
                                             gebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p. Let A be a finitely
                                             generated commutative k-algebra on which G acts rationally by k-algebra
                                             automorphisms. So G acts on Spec(A). One may then ask if the cohomology
                                             ring H ∗ (G, A) is finitely generated as a k-algebra.
                                                 We think of this as a question in invariant theory. Our question is not
                                             what combinations of G and A yield a finitely generated H ∗ (G, A). Instead
                                             we are interested in finding those G for which every A as above will give
                                             a finitely generated H ∗ (G, A). In particular, G should be such that for all
                                             these A the ring of invariants AG = H 0(G, A) is finitely generated. This
                                             is why we must restrict attention to geometrically reductive G. We believe
                                             no further restriction is needed, and our aim is to present some evidence for
                                             this. In characteristic zero there would be nothing to do. Indeed, suppose G
                                             is a reductive linear algebraic group over C. We are concerned with repre-
                                             sentations of the algebraic group, the so-called rational representations. The
                                             group is linearly reductive, meaning that all extensions of representations
                                             split (even when the representations are infinite dimensional). So there is

                                                                                    1
no higher rational cohomology and H ∗ (G, A) = AG . Thus our problem asks
nothing new in this case. That is why we now return to characteristic p.
Notice that in characteristic p there is one type of module or algebra for
which the invariants, including the higher invariants known as cohomology,
behave as in characteristic zero. They are the modules/algebras with good
filtration. They will serve as a natural tool in the sequel.
     Our proofs combine arguments and results from several earlier works.
As our question concerns ‘higher invariant theory’, it is clear that invariant
theory will play its part. On the other hand our work is a direct descendent
of the work of Evens for the case that G is a finite group, and the work
of Friedlander and Suslin for the case of finite group schemes. We try to
merge this strand with invariant theory and emphasize that in both cases G
happens to be geometrically reductive.
     Thus say G is geometrically reductive. Then we know by Nagata that
at least the ring of invariants AG = H 0 (G, A) is finitely generated. (As
explained in [4], Nagata’s proof [21] extends to group schemes.)
     By Waterhouse [28] a finite group scheme is geometrically reductive. If
G is a finite group scheme, then A is a finite module over AG and hence the
cohomology ring H ∗ (G, A) is indeed finitely generated by Friedlander and
Suslin [11]. (If G is finite reduced, see Evens [8, Thm. 8.1]. If G is finite and
connected, take C = AG in [11, Theorem 1.5, 1.5.1]. If G is not connected,
one finishes the argument by following [8] as on pages 220–221 of [11].)
     Note that if the geometrically reductive G is a subgroup of GLn ,
then GLn /G is affine, indGL    G
                                  n
                                    A is finitely generated, and H ∗ (G, A) =
              GL
H ∗ (GLn , indG n A). (Compare [21], [23], [13, Ch. II], [15, I 4.6, I 5.13].)
Therefore let us now assume G = GLn , or rather G = SLn to keep it semi-
simple. (The SLn case suffices, as H ∗ (GLn , A) = H ∗ (SLn , A)Gm for a GLn -
algebra A.)
     Grosshans [12] has introduced a filtration on A. The associated graded
ring gr A is finitely generated [12, Lemma 14]. There is a flat family with
general fibre A and special fibre gr A [12, Theorem 13]. Its counterpart in
characteristic zero was introduced by Popov [22]. Our first main result says

Theorem 1.1 If n < 6 or p > 2n , then H ∗ (SLn , gr A) is finitely generated
as a k-algebra.

Remark 1.2 In problems 3.10 and 3.11 we discuss how one could try to
remove the gr in the conclusion of the theorem.

                                       2
    Our second main result concerns the case n = 2, where we succeed in
removing the gr, using a family of universal cohomology classes which behaves
as if it is obtained by taking divided powers of the class e1 of Friedlander
and Suslin [11].

Theorem 1.3 (Cohomological invariant theory in rank one) Let A
be a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which SL2 acts rationally
by algebra automorphisms. Then H ∗ (SL2 , A) is finitely generated as a
k-algebra.

Remark 1.4 We know very little about the size of H ∗ (G, A), even in simple
examples. For instance, let p = 2 and consider the second Steinberg module
V = St2 of SL2 . The dimension of V is four. Its highest weight is three
times the fundamental weight. By the theorem H ∗ (SL2 , S ∗ (V )) is finitely
generated, where S ∗ (V ) denotes the symmetric algebra. But that is all we
know about the size of H ∗(SL2 , S ∗ (V )). Note that S ∗ (V ) does not have a
good filtration [5, p.71 Example], as H 1 (SL2 , S 2 (V )) 6= 0.


2      Recollections
For simplicity we stay with the important case G = SLn until 3.13. We choose
a Borel group B + = T U + of upper triangular matrices and the opposite
Borel group B − . The roots of B + are positive. If λ ∈ X(T ) is dominant,
then indG B − (λ) is the dual Weyl module ∇G (λ) with highest weight λ. In a
good filtration of a G-module the layers are of the form ∇G (µ). As in [27]
we will actually also allow a layer to be a direct sum of any number of copies
of the same ∇G (µ). If M is a G-module, and m ≥ −1 is an integer so that
H m+1 (G, ∇G (µ) ⊗ M) = 0 for all dominant µ, then we say as in [10] that M
has good filtration dimension at most m. The case m = 0 corresponds with
M having a good filtration. We say that M has good filtration dimension
precisely m, notation dim∇ (M) = m, if m is minimal so that M has good
filtration dimension at most m. In that case H i+1 (G, ∇G (µ) ⊗ M) = 0 for
all dominant µ and all i ≥ m. In particular H i+1 (G, M) = 0 for i ≥ m. If
there is no finite m so that dim∇ (M) = m, then we put dim∇ (M) = ∞.

Lemma 2.1 Let 0 → M ′ → M → M ′′ → 0 be exact. Then

    1. dim∇ (M) ≤ max(dim∇ (M ′ ), dim∇ (M ′′ )),

                                       3
  2. dim∇ (M ′ ) ≤ max(dim∇ (M), dim∇ (M ′′ ) + 1),

  3. dim∇ (M ′′ ) ≤ max(dim∇ (M), dim∇ (M ′ ) − 1),

  4. dim∇ (M ′ ⊗ M ′′ ) ≤ dim∇ (M ′ ) + dim∇ (M ′′ ).

2.2    Filtrations
If M is a G-module, and λ is a dominant weight, then M≤λ denotes the
largest G-submodule all whose weights µ satisfy µ ≤ λ in the usual partial
order [15, II 1.5]. Similarly M<λ denotes the largest G-submodule all whose
weights µ satisfy µ < λ. As in [27], we form the X(T )-graded module
                                     M
                         grX(T ) M =       M≤λ /M<λ .
                                      λ∈X(T )


Each M≤λ /M<λ , or M≤λ/<λ for short, has a B + -socle (M≤λ/<λ )U = MλU of
weight λ. We view M U as a B − -module through restriction (inflation) along
the homomorphism B − → T . Then M≤λ/<λ embeds naturally in its ‘good
filtration hull’ hull∇ (M≤λ/<λ ) = indG     U
                                       B − Mλ . This good filtration hull has the
same B + -socle and is the injective hull in the category Cλ of G-modules N
that satisfy N = N≤λ . Compare [27, 3.1.10].
     Let us apply this in particular to our finitely generated commutative k-
algebra with G action A. We get an X(T )-graded algebra grX(T ) A. We
convert it to a Z-graded algebraPthrough an additive height function ht :
X(T ) → Z, defined by ht(γ) = 2 α>0 hγ, α    bi, the sum being over the positive
roots. (Our ht is twice the one used by Grosshans, because we prefer to get
even degrees rather than just integer degrees.) The Grosshans graded algebra
is now                                   M
                                 gr A =     gri A,
                                        i≥0

with                                   M
                            gri A =             A≤λ/<λ .
                                      ht(λ)=i

It embeds in a good filtration hull, which Grosshans calls R, and which we
call hull∇ (gr A),
                                      M M
             hull∇ (gr A) = indG   U
                               B− A =          hull∇ (A≤λ /A<λ ).
                                            i   ht(λ)=i


                                        4
Grosshans shows that AU , gr A, hull∇ (gr A) are finitely generated with
hull∇ (gr A) finite over gr A. Mathieu did a little better in [19]. His argu-
ment shows that in fact hull∇ (gr A) is a p-root closure of gr A. That is,


Lemma 2.3 For every x ∈ hull∇ (gr A), there is an integer r ≥ 0, so that
  r
xp ∈ gr A.

Proof It suffices to take x ∈ hull∇ (A≤λ /A<λ ) for some λ. If λ = 0, then
                      G
hull∇ (A≤λ
         L/A<λ ) = A = gr0 A. So say λ > 0 and consider the subalgebra
S = k ⊕ i>0 hull∇ (A≤iλ /A<iλ ) of hull∇ (gr A), with its subalgebra S ∩ gr A.
Apply [27, Thm 4.2.3] to conclude that the p-root closure of S ∩ gr A in S
has a good filtration. As it contains all of S U , it must be S itself.     ✷

Example 2.4 Consider the multicone [16]
                                   +
                                                            M
    k[G/U] = indG        G      B        G
                U k = indB + indU k = indB + k[T ] =                  ∇G (λ).
                                                       λ   dominant
It is its own Grosshans graded ring. Recall [16] that it is finitely generated
by the sum of the ∇(̟i ), where ̟i denotes the ith fundamental weight.
Together with the transfer principle AU ∼
                                        = (k[G/U] ⊗ A)G , see [13, Ch Two],
this gives finite generation of AU .


3     Proof of Theorem 1.1
                          r
Choose r so big that xp ∈ gr A for all x ∈ hull∇ (gr A). We may view
gr A as a finite hull∇ (gr A)(r) -module, where the exponent (r) denotes an rth
Frobenius twist [15, I 9.2].

3.1    Key hypothesis
We assume that for every fundamental weight ̟i the symmetric algebra
S ∗ (∇(̟i )) has a good filtration.
     The hypothesis in theorem 1.1 is explained by

Lemma 3.2 If n < 6 or p > 2n , then the key hypothesis is satisfied.


                                       5
                                                            P
Proof We follow [1, section 4]. If p > 2n , then p > i dim(∇(̟i )), so
∧j (∇(̟i )) has a good filtration for all j by [1], so S ∗ (∇(̟i )) has a good
filtration by [1]. If n < 6, then by symmetry of the Dynkin diagram (con-
tragredient duality) it suffices to consider ̟1 and ̟2 . But S ∗ (∇(̟1 )) has a
good filtration for every n because ∧j (∇(̟1 )) has a good filtration for all j.
And S ∗ (∇(̟2 )) has a good filtration for every n by Boffi [3]. (Thanks to
J. Weyman and T. Jozefiak for pointing this out.)                             ✷

Example 3.3 (J. Weyman) If p = 2 and n ≥ 6, there is a submodule with
highest weight ̟6 in S 2 (∇(̟3 )). (If n = 6, read zero for ̟6 , as we are
working with SL6 rather than GL6 .) With a character computation this
implies that S 2 (∇(̟3 )) does not have a good filtration. The submodule in
question is generated by a highest weight vector which is a sum of ten terms
(e1 ∧ eσ(2) ∧ eσ(3) )(eσ(4) ∧ eσ(5) ∧ eσ(6) ). One sums over the ten permutations
σ of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 that satisfy σ(2) < σ(3) and σ(4) < σ(5) < σ(6).

    We want to view S ∗ (∇(̟i )) as a graded polynomial G-algebra with good
filtration. Let us collect the properties that we will use in a rather artificial
definition.

Definition 3.4 Let D be a diagonalizable group scheme [15, I 2.5]. We
say that P is a graded polynomial G × D-algebra with good filtration, if
the following holds. First of all P is a polynomial algebra over k in finitely
many variables. Secondly, these variables are homogeneous of non-negative
integer degree, thus making P into a graded k-algebra. There is also given
an action of G × D on P by algebra automorphisms that are compatible with
the grading, with G × D acting trivially on the degree zero part P0 of P .
This P0 is thus the polynomial algebra generated by the variables of degree
zero. The variables of positive degree generate their own polynomial algebra
P c , which we also assume to be G × D invariant. Thus P = P0 ⊗k P c . And
finally, P c is an algebra with a good filtration for the action of G. Then of
course, so is P .

Example 3.5 Our key hypothesis makes that one gets a graded polynomial
G × D-algebra with good filtration by taking for D any subgroup scheme of
T , with T acting on P = S ∗ (∇(̟i )) through its natural X(T )-grading: On
S j (∇(̟i )) we make T act with weight j̟i .



                                       6
     If Pi are graded polynomial G×Di -algebras with good filtration for i = 1,
2, then P1 ⊗ P2 is a graded polynomial G × (D1 × D2 )-algebra with good
filtration.

Definition 3.6 If P is a graded polynomial G × D-algebra with good fil-
tration, then by a finite graded P -module M we mean a finitely generated
Q-graded module for the graded polynomial ring, together with a G × D
action on M which is compatible with the grading and with the action on
P . It is not required that the action is trivial on the degree zero part of M.
We call M free if it is free as a module over the polynomial ring. We call M
extended if there is a finitely generated Q-graded P0 -module V with G × D
action, so that M = V ⊗P0 P as graded P -modules.

Lemma 3.7 Let P be a graded polynomial G×D-algebra with good filtration,
and let M be a finite graded P -module.

  1. There is a finite free resolution

                        0 → Fs → Fs−1 → · · · → F0 → M.

  2. Every finite free P -module has a finite filtration whose quotients are
     extended.

  3. dim∇ (M) < ∞.

  4. H i (G, M) is a finite P G -module for every i ≥ 0.

Proof Take a finite dimensional graded G × D-submodule V of M that
generates M as a P -module. Then F0 = V ⊗k P is free and it maps onto
M. As M has finite projective dimension [20, 18C], we may repeat until the
syzygy is projective. But a projective module over a polynomial ring is free
by Quillen and Suslin [17].
    Now consider a free P -module F . Let P+ be the ideal generated by the
Pi with i > 0. If F is free of rank t, then F/P+ F is free of rank t over P0 .
Choose homogeneous elements e1 , . . . , et in F so that their classes form a
basis of F/P+ F . Then the ei generate F (cf. [14, 6.13 Lemma 5]), so they
also form a basis of F . Let Fm be the component of lowest degree in F ,
assuming F 6= 0. The ei that lie in Fm form a basis of Fm over P0 . So Fm


                                         7
generates a free, extended submodule P Fm of F and the quotient F/P Fm is
free of lower rank.
     To show that dim∇ (M) < ∞, it suffices to consider the case of an ex-
tended module M = V ⊗P0 P . As V ⊗P0 P = V ⊗k P c , it suffices to check
that V has finite good filtration dimension. But V is a finitely generated
P0 -module and thus has only finitely many weights. Therefore the argu-
ment used in [10] to show that finite dimensional G modules have finite good
filtration dimension, applies to V .
     Finally let M be any finite graded P -module again. As G is reductive by
Haboush [15, 10.7], it is well known that H 0 (G, M) is a finite P G -module,
because (SP∗ (M))G is finitely generated. So we argue by dimension shift.
We claim that for s sufficiently large the module M ⊗ Sts ⊗ Sts has a good
filtration. It suffices to check this for the extended case M = V ⊗P0 P and
then one can use again that V has only finitely many weights, so that one
may choose s so large that all weights of V ⊗ k−(ps −1)ρ are anti-dominant.
Then V ⊗ Sts = indG      B + (V ⊗ k−(ps −1)ρ ) has a good filtration and so does
M ⊗ Sts ⊗ Sts . Then H i (G, M) is the cokernel of H i−1 (G, M ⊗ Sts ⊗ Sts ) →
H i−1 (G, M ⊗ Sts ⊗ Sts /M) for i ≥ 1.                                        ✷

                                               r
   Recall that we choose r so big that xp ∈ gr A for all x ∈ hull∇ (gr A). Let
Gr denote the r-th Frobenius kernel. We will need multiplicative structure
on a Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence. See for instance [2], translating
from modules over a Hopf algebra to comodules over a Hopf algebra.

Proposition 3.8 Assume the key hypothesis 3.1. With r as indicated, the
spectral sequence

               E2ij = H i (G/Gr , H j (Gr , gr A)) ⇒ H i+j (G, gr A)

stops, i.e. Es = E∞ for some s < ∞.
In fact, H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) has finite good filtration dimension.
Moreover, E2∗∗ is a finite module over the even part of E20∗ .

Proof By [11, Th 1.5, 1.5.1] the ring H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) is a finite module
over the algebra

                                                          ∗       #    a−1
SLn , it follows from [1, 4.3] that the algebra      a=1 S ((gln ) (2p     )) is a
graded polynomial G × {1}-algebra with good filtration. So we now try to
replace hull∇ (gr A) by a similarly nice algebra. That is, we seek a graded
polynomial G × D-algebra P with good filtration and a surjection P D →
hull∇ (gr A) of graded G-algebras. This is where the key hypothesis comes
in. Let v be a weight vector in hull∇ (gr A)U = AU . If v has weight zero,
we may map x to v, where x is the variable in a polynomial ring k[x] with
trivial grading and trivial G × T action. If v has weight λ 6= 0, take for
D the scheme theoretic kernel of λ and observe that by our hypothesis the
X(T )-graded algebra
                                   n−1
                                   O
                              P =      S ∗ (∇(̟i ))
                                     i=1

is a graded polynomial G × D-algebra    L with good filtration, if we give ∇(̟i )
degree ht(̟i ). We have P D =               j Pjλ , where Pjλ denotes the summand
Nn−1 mi                     P
   i=1 S (∇(̟i )) with         i mi ̟i = jλ. Choose a weight vector x of weight
λ in Pλ (for the G action). The map from the polynomial ring k[x] to
hull∇ (gr A)U which sends x to v extends uniquely to a G equivariant algebra
map P D → hull∇ (gr A) because Pjλ = (Pjλ)≤jλ . (The first subscript in the
right hand side refers to a T action associated with the X(T )-grading, the
second to the G action on P .) Compare [27, 4.2.4]. As AU is finitely gener-
ated, we may combine finitely many such maps P (i)D(i) → hull∇ (gr A) into
one surjective map P D → hull∇ (gr A), with D the product of the D(i) and P
the tensor product of the P (i). If we let the linearly reductive D act on P ⊗P D
H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) through its action on P , then H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) is just the
direct summand, as a G-module, consisting of the D-invariants. So in order
to show that H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) has finite good filtration dimension, it suffices
to show that PN   ⊗P D H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) has finite good filtration dimension. We
now view P ⊗ ra=1 S ∗ ((gln )# (2pa−1 )) as a graded polynomial G × D-algebra
with good filtration. (Collect the bigrading into a single   Nr total  grading.) The
                                (−r)
                   ∗
algebra P ⊗P D H (Gr , gr A)         is a finite graded P ⊗ a=1 S ((gln )# (2pa−1 ))-
                                                                    ∗

module. (We need a Q-grading on P ⊗P D H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) because of the
twist.) By Lemma 3.7 such a P -module has finite good filtration dimension.
Therefore there are only finitely many i with E2i∗ 6= 0 and the spectral se-
quence stops. By   N  the same lemma H i (G, P ⊗P D H ∗ (Gr , gr A)(−r) ) is finite
                      r
over H 0 (G, P ⊗ a=1 S ∗ ((gln )# (2pa−1 ))). Taking     ND-invariants  again, we see
                                                           r
that E2 is a finite module over H (G/Gr , (P ⊗ a=1 S ((gln ) (2pa−1 )))(r) ).
        ∗∗                              0            D          ∗      #

But this ring acts by way of the the even part of E20∗ .                         ✷

3.9    End of proof of theorem 1.1
Look some more at the spectral sequence of Proposition 3.8. We argue partly
as in Evens’ proof of his finite generation theorem [2, 4.2], [8]. As we have
already observed, it follows from [11] that H ∗ (Gr , gr A) is noetherian over its
finitely generated even degree part. By the proposition E2 is noetherian over
the even degree part of E20∗ , which is finitely generated because G/Gr is reduc-
tive. Or, recall from the proof of the proposition that
                                                     Nr the∗E2 term  is finite over
the finitely generated k-algebra H (G/Gr , (P ⊗ a=1 S ((gln ) (2pa−1 )))(r) ).
                                    0             D                #

Now the E2 term is a differential graded algebra in characteristic p, so the
pth power of an element of the even part passes to the next term in the
spectral sequence. Therefore E3 is also noetherian over its finitely generated
even degree part. As the spectral sequence stops, we get by repeating this
argument that E∞ is finitely generated. But then so is the abutment.             ✷

Problem 3.10 There is a spectral sequence

                     E1ij = H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A),

and the theorem says that E1 is finitely generated. The generators are in
bidegree (0, 0) or (i, j) with i + j > 0, i < 0. We would like this spectral
sequence to stop too. It would suffice to know that if J is a G-stable ideal
in a ring like A, then the even part of H ∗ (G, A/J) is integral over the image
of the even part of H ∗ (G, A). Of course this integrality would be implied
by finite generation of H ∗ (G, SA∗ (A/J)). But recall that Nagata proves first
that H 0 (G, A/J) is integral over H 0 (G, A). So one could hope for a direct
proof.
                                                           L
Problem 3.11 If M is a vector space, let Γ∗ (M) = m (S m (M # ))# denote
its divided power algebra. It is probably too much to ask for a divided power
structure on the even part of the bigraded algebra H ∗ (GLn , Γ∗ ((gln )(2)(1) )),
extending the divided power structure [7, Appendix A2], [24] on the graded
algebra H 0 (GLn , Γ∗ ((gln )(2)(1) )). But such a structure would be very helpful,
as it would explain and enrich the supply of universal cohomology classes
from [11]. And H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A) would then undoubtedly stop.
See our treatment of the rank one case below.


                                        10
Problem 3.12 To improve on the conditions of theorem 1.1, rather than
on its conclusion, one should try and prove the following. If our finitely
generated A has a good filtration and M is a finite A-module on which G
acts compatibly, then H ∗ (G, M) is finite over AG . Of course this would again
be implied by finite generation of H ∗ (G, SA∗ (M)).

Remark 3.13 Let G be a semi-simple group defined over k, and let V be a
tilting G-module [6] of dimension n. Choose a basis in V and assume that the
representation is faithful, so that G can be identified with a subgroup of SLn .
Assume p > n/2. Then S ∗ ((gln )# ) has a good filtration as a G-module [1,
4.3]. Also assume for every fundamental weight ̟i of G that the symmetric
algebra S ∗ (∇(̟i )) has a good filtration. This happens for instance when p
exceeds the dimensions of the fundamental representations of G. Let A be
a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which G acts rationally by
k-algebra automorphisms. Then again H ∗ (G, gr A) is finitely generated as a
k-algebra. The proof is the same as the proof of theorem 1.1.


4     Divided powers
Let W2 (k) = W (k)/p2W (k) be the ring of Witt vectors of length two over k,
see [25, II §6]. One has an extension of algebraic groups

                  1 → gl(1)
                        n → GLn (W2 (k)) → GLn (k) → 1,

whence a cocycle class e1 ∈ H 2 (GLn , gl(1)
                                         n ). We call it the Witt vector class
for GLn . Analogously there are Witt vector extensions and Witt vector
classes for other groups that are originally defined over the integers, and for
Frobenius kernels in them.

Remark 4.1 Observe that if xα : Ga → SLn is a root homomorphism cor-
responding to the root α, then the restriction of e1 to Ga is non-trivial. In
fact one may restrict further to the Frobenius kernel Ga1 . This Ga1 acts
trivially on gl(1)                                           (1)
                  n , and the T -equivariant projection of gln onto its pα weight
space is thus also Ga1 -equivariant. Altogether we get an image β of e1 in
H 2 (Ga1 , (gl(1)     T
              n )pα ) . It is just the Witt vector class of Ga1 . It is well known
that this class is non-trivial, compare [15, I 4.22, I 4.25], [11, §6]. Also note
that the image of β in H 2 (Ga1 , gl(1)
                                      n ) under the map induced by the inclusion
      (1)             (1)
of (gln )pα into gln is the same as the restriction of e1 to Ga1 .

                                       11
Lemma 4.2 The Witt vector class for GLn coincides with the universal co-
homology class e1 of Friedlander and Suslin, up to a non-zero scalar factor.

Proof Using [11, Remark 1.2.1, Corollary 3.13] we see it suffices to take
r = j = 1 and q = 2 in [11, Theorem 4.5].                              ✷

4.3    Divided powers in rank one.
If R is a commutative k-algebra, and M is a finite dimensional vector
space over k, then the divided power algebra R ⊗ Γ∗ (M) = Γ∗R (R ⊗ M)
is a ring with divided powers ([7, Appendix A2]). We write ∆i,j for
the component Γi+j (M) → Γi (M) ⊗ Γj (M) of the comultiplication map
Γ∗ (M) → Γ∗ (M) ⊗ Γ∗ (M). So ∆i,j is the dual of the multiplication map
S i (M # ) ⊗ S j (M # ) → S i+j (M # ). If v ∈ M has divided powers v [i] ∈ Γi (M),
then ∆i,j (v [i+j] ) = v [i] ⊗ v [j] . Put G = GLn and define T , B + , B − as
usual. Actually n will be two, but we optimistically keep writing n. Let
r ≥ 1. As Gr acts trivially on gl(r)    n , there is a divided power structure on
H (Gr , Γ (gln )) = H (Gr , k) ⊗ Γ∗ (gl(r)
   even       ∗    (r)       even
                                                  n ), with the m-th divided power
operation going from H 2a (Gr , Γb (gl(r)n  )) to H 2am (Gr , Γbm (gl(r)
                                                                     n )) for b ≥ 1.


  It would be nice to extend the next theorem toLarbitrary n. We do not
know how to put a divided power structure on       mH
                                                        2m
                                                           (GLn , Γm (gl(1)
                                                                        n )).
Nevertheless we feel the theorem is named appropriately.

Theorem 4.4 (Divided powers in rank one) Let n = 2.                     There are
classes c[m] ∈ H 2m (GLn , Γm (gl(1)
                                 n )) so that

  1. c[1] is the Witt vector class e1 ,

  2. (∆i,j )∗ (c[i + j]) = c[i] ∪ c[j] for i, j ≥ 1.

Proof Let α be the negative root, and let xα : Ga → GLn be
its root homomorphism. By Kempf vanishing H 2m (GLn , Γm (gl(1)           n )) =
   2m      m      (1) T
H (Ga , Γ (gln )) , see [15, II 4.7c]. So we restrict to Ga along xα . As
Ga acts trivially on Γ∗ ((gl(1)
                              n )pα ), we also have a divided power structure on
H (Ga , Γ ((gln )pα )) = H even (Ga , k)⊗Γ∗ ((gl(1)
   even      ∗      (1)
                                                   n )pα ). Take the m-th divided
             even        ∗   (1)     T
power in H (Ga , Γ ((gln )pα )) of the Witt vector class of Ga and map it
to H 2m (Ga , Γm (gl(1)   T                          (1)          (1)
                      n )) using the inclusion of (gln )pα into gln . One lands in



                                          12
H 2m (B − , Γm (gl(1)  ∼ 2m (G, Γm (gl(1) )). This gives the desired class c[m].
                  n )) = H                n
Indeed (∆i,j )∗ (c[i + j]) = c[i] ∪ c[j] holds in the context of the divided power
algebra H even (Ga , Γ∗ ((gl(1)
                            n )pα )) = H
                                          even
                                               (Ga , k) ⊗ Γ∗ ((gl(1)
                                                                 n )pα ) and thus the
result follows by functoriality of ∆i,j and of cup product.                        ✷

4.5     Other universal classes
If M is a finite dimensional vector space over k and r ≥ 1, we have a nat-
ural homomorphism between symmetric algebras S ∗ (M #(r) ) → S ∗ (M #(1) )
                                    r−1
induced by the map M #(r) → S p (M #(1) ) which raises an element to the
power pr−1 . It is a map of bialgebras. Dually we have the bialgebra map
            r−1
π r−1 : Γp ∗ (M(1)) → Γ∗ (M(r)) whose kernel is the ideal generated by
                      r−1                           r−1
Γ1 (M (1) ) through Γp −1 (M (1) ). So π r−1 maps Γp a (M(1)) onto Γa (M(r)).
                                                                             (j)
Notation 4.6 We now introduce analogues of the classes er and er of Fried-
lander and Suslin [11, Theorem 1.2, Remark 1.2.2]. We write π∗r−1 (c[apr−1 ]) ∈
     r−1                                                      r−1
H 2ap (G, Γa (gl(r)
                n )) as cr [a]. Next we get cr [a]
                                                   (j)
                                                       ∈ H 2ap (G, Γa (gln(r+j) ))
by Frobenius twist.

Lemma 4.7 The ci [a](r−i) enjoy the following properties (r ≥ i ≥ 1)
                                                                       i−1
   1. There is a homomorphism of algebras S ∗ (gln#(r) ) → H 2p ∗ (Gr , k) given
      on S a (gln#(r) ) = H 0 (Gr , S a (gln#(r) )) by cup product with the restriction
      of ci [a](r−i) .
                                                       r−1
   2. For r ≥ 1 the restriction of cr [1] to H 2p (G1 , gl(r)
                                                           n ) is nontrivial, so
      that cr [1] may serve as the universal class er in [11, Thm 1.2].

Proof 1. By theorem 4.4 we have (∆a,b )∗ (ci [a + b]) = (∆a,b π r−1 )∗ (c[(a +
b)pr−1 ]) = (π r−1 ⊗ π r−1 )∗ (∆apr−1 ,bpr−1 )∗ (c[(a + b)pr−1 ]) = (π r−1 ⊗
π r−1 )∗ (c[apr−1 ] ∪ c[bpr−1 ]) = ci [a] ∪ ci [b] and thus (∆a,b )∗ (ci [a + b](r−i) ) =
ci [a](r−i) ∪ ci [b](r−i) by pull back along a Frobenius homomorphism. Put
R = H even (Gr , k) and restrict from G to Gr . We view H even (Gr , Γ∗ (gl(r)        n ))
as Γ∗R (R ⊗ gl(r) n  )).  Now    the  cup product   agrees with the    usual   R-valued
pairing between S ∗ (gln#(r) ) and Γ∗R (R ⊗ gl(r)    n ).  Thus if x ∈ S a (gln#(r) ),
            #(r)
y ∈ S b (gln ), then (xy) ∪ (ci [a + b](r−i) ) = (x ⊗ y) ∪ ((∆a,b )∗ (ci [a + b](r−i) )) =
(x ∪ ci [a](r−i) )(y ∪ ci [b](r−i) ).
                                                               r−1
2. In fact if we restrict cr [1] as in remark 4.1 to H 2p (Ga1 , (gl(r)       n )p r α ) =
    2pr−1                 (r)
H         (Ga1 , k) ⊗ (gln )p α , then even that restriction is nontrivial. That is
                               r




                                           13
because the Witt vector class generates the polynomial ring H even (Ga1 , k),
see [15, I 4.26].                                                          ✷

Corollary 4.8 Let n = 2, r ≥ 1. Further let A be a commutative k-algebra
with SLn action and J an invariant ideal in A so that the algebra A/J is
finitely generated. Then H 0 (SLn , H ∗ ((SLn )r , A/J)) is a noetherian module
over a finitely generated subalgebra of H even (SLn , A).

Proof We may assume A is finitely generated. Put C = H 0 ((SLn )r , A)).
Then C contains the elements of A raised to the power pr , so C is also a
finitely generated algebra and A/J is a noetherian module over it. By [11,
Thm 1.5] H ∗ ((SLn )r , A/J) is a noetherian module over the finitely generated
algebra
                            O r
                        R=       S ∗ ((gl(r) #
                                         n ) (2p
                                                 a−1
                                                     )) ⊗ C.
                           a=1

Then, by invariant theory [13, Thm. 16.9], H 0 (SLn , H ∗((SLn )r , A/J)) is a
noetherian module over the finitely generated algebra H 0 (SLn , R). By lemma
4.7 we may take the algebra homomorphism R → H ∗ ((SLn )r , A/J) of [11] to
be based on cup product with our ci [a](r−i) . But then the map H 0 (SLn , R) →
H ∗ ((SLn )r , A/J) factors, as a linear map, through H even (SLn , A).       ✷

4.9    The contraction
Let A be a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which SLP  n acts ratio-
nally. Recall that A comes with an increasing filtration A≤i = ht(λ)≤i A≤λ
whose associated graded is the ring gr A. Let A be the subring of the poly-
nomial ring A[t] generated by the subsets ti A≤i . This ring A, denoted D by
Grosshans, is the coordinate ring of a flat family with general fibre A and
special fibre gr A [12, Theorem 13].

4.10     The special fibre
There is a Phomomorphism of P    graded algebras A → gr A with kernel tA,
mapping ti ht(λ)=i A≤λ onto ht(λ)=i A≤λ /A<λ by ‘dropping ti ’. By corol-
lary 4.8 the even part of E20∗ in proposition 3.8 is noetherian over a finitely
generated subalgebra R of H even (SLn , A). Therefore proposition 3.8 implies



                                      14
in the usual way ([11, Lemma 1.6]) that in fact the abutment H ∗ (SLn , gr A)
is noetherian over R.

4.11     The general fibre
One gets a homomorphism A → A by substituting a nonzero scalar for
t. Let us
        P use ithe substitution t 7→ 1. On A we put the filtration with
A≤m = i≤m t A≤i . Then the associated graded gr A is just A itself. The
map A → A is compatible with the filtrations, so we get a map of spectral
sequences from
             E(A) :    E1ij (A) = H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A)
to
             E(A) :    E1ij (A) = H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A).
Note that by the construction of the Grosshans filtration H 0 (G, gr−i A) van-
ishes for i 6= 0. Further E1∗∗ (A) is finitely generated by theorem 1.1 and
therefore there are for each m only finitely many non-zero E1m−i,i (A). This
makes that, even though the spectral sequence is a second quadrant spectral
                                                                ∗∗
sequence, the abutment will be finitely generated as soon as E∞    (A) is.
Theorem 4.12 (Cohomological invariant theory in rank one) Let A
be a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which SL2 acts rationally by
algebra automorphisms. Then H ∗ (SL2 , A) is finitely generated as a k-algebra.

Proof We combine the above. The spectral sequence
             E(A) :    E1ij (A) = H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A)
is pleasantly boring: It does not just degenerate, even its abutment is the
same as its E1 . The spectral sequence E(A) is a module over it [18].
In particular, E(A) is a module over the finitely generated subring R of
H even (SLn , A) over which E1∗∗ (A) is noetherian by 4.10. (Yes, the homomor-
phism R → E1∗∗ (A) agrees with the homomorphism E1∗∗ (A) → E1∗∗ (A).) So
the usual argument (see proof of [11, Lemma 1.6] or [9, Lemma 7.4.4]) shows
                              ∗∗
that E(A) stops and that E∞      (A) is noetherian over R.                  ✷
Corollary 4.13 Let A be a finitely generated commutative k-algebra on
which SL2 acts rationally by algebra automorphisms. Assume that A has
a good filtration. Let M be a finitely generated A module with a compatible
SL2 action. Then M has finite good filtration dimension.

                                      15
Proof Write G = SL2 . If we tensor A with the multicone k[G/U] of
example 2.4, then the result is a finitely generated G-acyclic k-algebra
A ⊗ k[G/U] over which we have a finitely generated module M ⊗ k[G/U].
As H ∗ (G, SA⊗k[G/U
             ∗
                     ] (M ⊗ k[G/U])) is finitely generated by the theorem,
  i
H (G, M ⊗ k[G/U]) vanishes for i >> 0. But this means that M has fi-
nite good filtration dimension.                                         ✷
