                                                    We generalize certain parts of the theory of group rings to the twisted case. Let
                                                    G be a finite group acting (possibly trivially) on a field L of characteristic coprime
                                                    to the order of the kernel of this operation. Let K ⊆ L be the fixed field of this
                                                    operation, let S be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions K, maximal ideal
                                                    generated by π and integral closure T in L. We compute the colength of T ≀ G in a
                                                    maximal order in L≀G. Moreover, if S/πS is finite, we compute the S/πS-dimension
                                                    of the center of T ≀ G/Jac(T ≀ G). If this quotient is split semisimple, this yields a
                                                    formula for the number of simple T ≀ G-modules, generalizing Brauer’s formula.

0       Introduction

0.1     Outline
Let G be a finite group acting on a field L with fixed field K. The twisted group ring
L ≀ G carries the multiplication (σy)(τ z) = στ y τ z, where σ, τ ∈ G, y, z ∈ L (1 ).
We denote by N the kernel of the operation of G on L. If N = G, then K = L and L ≀ G
is nothing but the untwisted classical group ring KG. If N = 1, then L ≀ G has the only
simple module L, and is isomorphic to EndK L.
If the characteristic of L and the order of N are coprime, then L ≀ G is semisimple, and
even separable over K. Many of the apparent difficulties we shall encounter vanish if
the characteristic of L and the order of G are coprime. For instance, in this case the
Plancherel formula (1.16) is immediate.
The Wedderburn isomorphism sends an element of L ≀ G to the tuple of its operations
on the simple modules, such an operation being considered as an endomorphism over
the respective L ≀ G-linear endomorphism skew field. The Plancherel formula yields a
Fourier inversion formula for this isomorphism. Schur relations may then be deduced
from composition of the Wedderburn isomorphism with its Fourier inversion. A theory of
characters and a Brauer-Nesbitt theorem ensue.
Let S ⊆ K be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions K, maximal ideal generated
by π and residue field S̄ := S/πS of characteristic p ≥ 0. The π-adic valuation of an
element y ∈ K is denoted by v(y). Let T ⊆ L be the integral closure of S in L, and
denote T̄ := T /πT . Choosing T ≀ G-lattices inside the simple L ≀ G-modules, we may
restrict the Wedderburn isomorphism to a full embedding of T ≀ G into a tuple of matrix
rings over certain extensions of S. We calculate the colength of this embedding, that is,
the S-linear length of its cokernel.
Now suppose S̄ to be finite. The question for the number of indecomposable projec-
tive T ≀ G-modules leads to the question for the number of simple T̄ ≀ G-modules. If
T̄ ≀ G/Jac(T̄ ≀ G) is a split semisimple S̄-algebra, then this number coincides with the S̄-
linear dimension of Z(T̄ ≀ G/Jac(T̄ ≀ G)). This dimension in turn is given by a sum of
certain vectorspace dimensions, indexed by the p′ -classes of G. In the untwisted case,
each of these dimensions equals 1. Thus we recover a theorem of Brauer.


0.2     Motivation
The untwisted group ring SG has the principal module S, endowed with the trivial G-
operation. This module is projective if and only if the order of G is invertible in S.
The twisted group ring T ≀ G has the principal module T , endowed with the Galois
operation of G. This module is projective if and only if the order of N is invertible in S
    1
    This ring is also known as skew group ring of G with coefficients in L, see e.g. [12, p. 59]. Using the
terminology twisted group ring of [9, §28], we should mention that there are more general twisted group
rings still, involving 2-cocycles of G with coefficients in L∗ .
                                                                                                   3


and the extension T /S is tamely ramified (Speiser, E. Noether, cf. 2.4).
Therefore, wildness of T /S corresponds to a nontrivial homological behaviour of T over
T ≀ G, which one is led to study. This seems to be more easily accessible than the related
homological behaviour of T over SG. For instance, we have Ext∗T ≀G (T, T ) ≃ Ext∗SG (S, T ),
and in particular cases it is possible to calculate the left hand side in order to obtain the
right hand side. Here, we will restrict our considerations to some general properties of
twisted group rings, however.


0.3     Known Results
Beautiful results on the classical case N = G abound. It might be worthwhile to attempt
to extend certain of them to the twisted case. For example, so far there is no theory on
induction and restriction that allows to independently vary the group and the ring (cf.
[12, ch. 4], [9, §§ 10, 11, 19, 20]) (2 ).
On the other hand, there are several results for the case N = 1. The theorem of
Auslander-Goldman states that T ≀ G is isomorphic to (S)|G| if and only if T /S is
unramified and all occurring residue field extensions are separable [9, 28.5]. The theorem
of Auslander-Rim states that T ≀ G is hereditary if and only if T /S is tamely ramified
[9, 28.7].
If we admit wild ramification, or if nontrivial 2-cocycles enter, the situation gets more
involved. Still, we assume N = 1.

   • Wilson’s theorem calculates the locally free class group of OL ≀ G to be the class
     group of a maximal OK -order containing it, provided OL /OK is a finite extension
     of Dedekind domains giving rise to an extension L/K of global fields with Galois
     group G [10, 50.64, 49.33, 49.32].

   • Williamson gives a criterion for π-principal heredity of T ≀f G, where f is a 2-
     cocycle of G with values in T ∗ [28, 3.5]. In contrast to the above-mentioned the-
     orems, it may occur that T ≀f G is hereditary, and even maximal, whereas T /S is
     wildly ramified [27, 2.5].

   • Benz and Zassenhaus showed that T ≀f G is contained in a unique minimal hered-
     itary overorder, S assumed to be complete [1].

   • Cliff and Weiss showed how invariants of this hereditary overorder depend on the
     inertia and ramification indices of T /S, and the Schur index of L ≀f G [8].

   • If [L : K] = 2, Chalatsis and Theohari-Apostolidi classified the indecompos-
     able OL ≀ G-lattices [6, Th. 2].

   • Weber described the image of the Wedderburn embedding for T = Z(p) [ζpm ], G =
     Cp and S = Z(p) [ζpm−1 ] [25].

   For this purpose, it might be useful to consider a larger class of rings with group operation than
merely Galois extensions of fields – cf. section 1.3.

For N arbitrary, Nakayama and Shoda investigated twisted group rings L ≀ G over a
field L such that the order of G is invertible in L, relating the representations of L ≀ G
and KN [15]. Omitting this invertibility condition, Bonami investigated centers and
radicals in [2].
Moreover, the ring K ≀f G has been studied thoroughly, where f is a 2-cocycle with
coefficients in the trivial G-module K ∗ ; one reason being its connection to Clifford theory
(cf. [9, 11.19, 11.20]). See also [24, (10.5)].


0.4    Results
Let g := |G|, n := |N| and h := [L : K], so nh = g. Let {Xi | i ∈ [1, k]} be a complete
set of nonisomorphic simple L ≀ G-right modules and let Ki := EndL≀G Xi . Let xi denote
the dimension of Xi as a right module over Ki , let ri denote the degree [Ki : K] and let
d2i denote the degree of Ki over its center. We have xi di /h ∈ Z (1.14). Let Vi ⊆ Xi be a
finitely generated T ≀ G-module such that KVi = Xi and such that Vi is free as a module
over Si := EndT ≀G Vi .
The colength of an embedding of S-modules is defined to be the Jordan-Hölder multiplicity
of S̄ in its quotient. If S̄ is finite, then colength = log|S̄| (index).
Let Si+ := {y ∈ Ki | TrKi /K (ySi ) ⊆ S} and let δSi /S be the colength of Si ⊆ Si+ .
Let T + := {y ∈ L | TrL/K (yT ) ⊆ S} and let δT /S be the colength of T ⊆ T + .

In particular, this integer is positive or zero.
The essential ingredient for (2.15) is the Plancherel formula (1.16). Using an analogous
central Plancherel formula (1.40), we obtain a central colength formula (2.25).
Schur relations allow to derive a Brauer-Nesbitt theorem. Let t be the maximal elementary
divisor exponent of the Gram matrix of the trace bilinear form on T induced by TrL/K .
Note that v(xi ) ≤ v(g) + t − v(di ) (2.21).
Theorem (3.1). Let i ∈ [1, k]. Suppose that K = Ki and that v(xi ) = v(g) + t. Then the
reduction Vi /πVi of the simple Λ-lattice Vi is a simple T̄ ≀ G-module.
Moreover, we shall count simple modules.
Theorem (1.29, 3.14).
 (i) The K-linear dimension of the center Z(L ≀ G) equals the number of conjugacy
     classes of N. In particular, if L ≀ G is split semisimple over K, then this number
     equals the number of isoclasses of simple L ≀ G-modules.

 (ii) Let T̄0 := T /Jac(T ). Let

                     Vσ := S̄h(y σ − y)z, y ρ − y | y, z ∈ T̄0 , ρ ∈ CG (σ)i ⊆ T̄0 .

      Let Cl(G, p′) be a set of representatives of p′ -classes of G. We have
                                                                    X
                        dimS̄ Z((T ≀ G)/Jac(T ≀ G)) =                          dimS̄ (T̄0 /Vσ ) .
                                                                 σ∈Cl(G,p′ )


      In particular, if T ≀ G/Jac(T ≀ G) is split semisimple over S̄, then this number equals
      the number of isoclasses of simple T ≀ G-modules, or, which is the same, the number
      of isoclasses of indecomposable projective T ≀ G-modules.

If T̄0 is a field, and if σ is not contained in the kernel N0 of the operation of G on T̄0 , then
T̄0 /Vσ = 0. This indicates a similarity of (ii) to (i).

1.1     The Plancherel formula
Definition 1.1 Let C be a commutative ring, acted upon by a group G with fixed ring
B := FixG C, an element τ ∈ G sending an element y ∈ C to y τ . The twisted group ring
C ≀ G is defined as follows. As a right C-module, it is free on the underlying set of the
group G. The multiplication is defined by
                                       !                 !                                      !
                                                                                     τ
                           X               X                       X         X

                          σ∈G              τ ∈G                    ρ∈G       τ ∈G


where yσ , zτ ∈ C for σ, τ ∈ G. Or, less formally, we extend (σy)(τ z) = (στ )(y τ z) B-
linearly. Note that C ≀ G is a B-algebra.

Notation 1.2 Let G be a finite group acting on a field L with fixed field K := FixG L.
Let H be the image of the operation map G - Aut fields L, i.e. H = Gal(L/K), and let
N denote the kernel of this operation map. The orders are denoted by

                                           h := |H| = [L : K]
                                           g := |G|
                                           n := |N| ,

so g = hn. Let u ∈ L be such that TrL/K (u) = 1. Choose a K-basis (yl )l∈[1,h] of L, and let
(yl∗)l∈[1,h] be its dual basis with respect to TrL/K , i.e. TrL/K (yl ym
                                                                       ∗
                                                                         ) = ∂l,m for l, m ∈ [1, h].
Whenever useful, we assume y1 = 1.

Lemma 1.3 (Maschke, cf. [9, 28.7]) The K-algebra L ≀ G is semisimple if and only if
n is invertible in K.
                                                                         f
Suppose n to be invertible in K. Given an epimorphism of L ≀ G-modules X - X ′′ , we
                                     i0
choose an L-linear coretraction X ′′ - X and let
                                            i
                                X ′′        -       X
                                                       X
                                x′′         -       n−1 (x′′ σ)i0 · uσ −1 ,
                                                             σ∈G

which is L ≀ G-linear and satisfies if = 1X ′′ .
Conversely, suppose L≀G to be semisimple. Since L≀G - L : σy - y is an epimorphism,
it has a coretraction, which is necessarily of the form L - L ≀ G : 1 - z σ∈G σ for some
                                                                         P

z ∈ L. Composition yields n · TrL/K (z) = 1.


Henceforth, we assume n to be invertible in K. Now, alternatively, semisimplicity en-
sues from the following lemma [20, 7.18, 7.20]
                                                                                                     7


Lemma 1.4 The K-algebra L ≀ G is separable.
We have to show that the (L ≀ G)o ⊗K (L ≀ G)-linear epimorphism

                            (L ≀ G)o ⊗K (L ≀ G)                  -   L≀G
                                  σu ⊗  vρ                       -   σuvρ

is split, where σ, ρ ∈ G, u, v ∈ L. Let i∈I ξi ⊗ ηi ∈ L ⊗K L ≃                    L be the element that
                                          P                                   Q
                                                                              H
satisfies i∈I ξi ηiλ = ∂1,λ u for λ ∈ H. Then
          P


                         L≀G        -               (L ≀ G)o ⊗K (L ≀ G)

                                                κ∈G, i∈I

is a coretraction as sought for.

Lemma 1.5 (Dedekind) Equipped with the operation y · (σz) := y σ z, where y, z ∈ L,
σ ∈ G, the field L becomes an absolutely simple module over L ≀ G, called the principal
module. We have EndL≀G L = K. The module L is the simple module of the block L ≀ H
of L ≀ G, unique up to isomorphism.
Consider the map
                                               ωH
                                   L≀H         -          EndK L
                                     σy        -          (z - z σ y).
Both source and target are of dimension h2 over K. Injectivity of ωH is the content of
Dedekind’s Lemma.

Definition 1.6 Let

                    (σy, τ z) := ∂σ,τ −1 TrL/K (y τ z) = n1 TrK (u(−)σyτ z)

define a K-bilinear form on L ≀ G, where σ, τ ∈ G, y, z ∈ L, and where ξ(−)ξ ′ denotes
the K-linear endomorphism of L ≀ G that sends η to ξηξ ′, where ξ, ξ ′ ∈ L ≀ G. This bilinear
form is symmetric, associative and nondegenerate.

Notation 1.7 Let {Xi | i ∈ [1, k]} be a complete set of nonisomorphic simple L ≀ G-right
modules and let Ki := EndL≀G Xi be the respective endomorphism skew field. Let xi
denote the dimension of Xi as a left module over Ki , let ri denote the degree [Ki : K].
Choose X1 = L, whence K1 = K. Choose a maximal commutative subfield Ei of Ki that
is separable over K, and let ci := [Z(Ki ) : K] and di := [Ei : Z(Ki )] = [Ki : Ei ] [20,
7.15]. In particular, ri = ci d2i . So altogether,
                            ci            di         di                  ri
                       (K ⊆ Z(Ki ) ⊆ Ei ⊆ Ki ) = (K ⊆ Ki ) .

Denote the operation of L ≀ G on Xi by
                                               ωi
                                    L≀G         -     EndKi Xi .

The Wedderburn isomorphism, of K-algebras, reads
                                           ω        Y
                                 L≀G       -
                                           ∼              EndKi Xi
                                                  i∈[1,k]
                                     ξ      -     (ξωi)i∈[1,k] .

In particular, gh = i∈[1,k] ri x2i . Note that we may interpret ω1 , up to isomorphism, as
                    P

the surjective ring morphism L ≀ G - L ≀ H induced by G - H.
Let trKi/Z(Ki ) : Ki - Z(Ki ) denote the reduced trace [20, 9.6a, 9.3], and let

                       trKi /K := TrZ(Ki )/K ◦ trKi /Z(Ki ) : Ki - K .

Remark 1.8 The next aim is to provide the Plancherel formula (1.16), which is needed
in section 2. Note that if h was assumed to be invertible in L, then the following con-
siderations would simplify considerably, for then we would be able to write (σy, τ z) =
1
g
  TrK ((−)σyτ z). In our situation, however, we have to split up everything and to keep
track of the various identifications.

Notation 1.9 (auxiliary) Let F be a finite galois extension of K that contains L and
that contains Ei for all i ∈ [1, k]. Given i ∈ [1, k], we let Θi be the set of K-linear
embeddings of Z(Ki ) into F , so in particular |Θi| = ci . For each ϑ ∈ Θi , we choose a
prolongation ϑ̂ : Ei - F of ϑ.
                                                            (xi )
By choice of a Ki -linear basis, we identify Xi = Ki                , considered as a row of EndKi Xi =
(Ki )xi .
Given µ ∈ H, we let eµ ∈ F ⊗K L ≃               F be mapped to (∂µ,λ )λ under this isomorphism.

Remark 1.10 Suppose given i ∈ [1, k]. We have an isomorphism of Ei -algebras
                                                   ∼-

(cf. [20, pf. of 7.15, pf. of 7.11]). Therefore, we have an isomorphism of F -algebras
                                           ∼-
                        F ⊗K Ki                             EndF (F ϑ̂⊗Ki )

                                                                              ϑ̂
where we denote F ϑ̂⊗Ki := F ⊗Ei Ki with respect to Ei  - F , and where f ϑ̂(−)w
denotes the F -linear endomorphism of F ϑ̂⊗Ki that sends f ′ ⊗ w ′ to f f ′ ⊗ w ′w (cf. [20,

Lemma 1.11 Given i ∈ [1, k], w ∈ Ki and ϑ ∈ Θi , we have
                          X

Using an Ei -linear basis of Ki as an F -linear basis of F ϑ̂⊗K Ki , we see, denoting by (−)w
the Ei -linear multiplication endomorphism of Ki , that

                                  TrF (1 ϑ̂(−)w) = (TrEi ((−)w))ϑ̂
                                                 = (trKi /Z(Ki ) (w))ϑ
by definition of the reduced trace [20, 9.6a, 9.3, pf. of 7.15], cf. (1.10).

Lemma 1.12 Representatives for the isoclasses of simple F ⊗K L ≀ G-modules are given
by F ϑ̂⊗Xi , where i ∈ [1, k], ϑ ∈ Θi . Note that Xi is a left Ei -module by restriction from
Ki . Given f ∈ F and ξ ∈ L ≀ G, f ⊗ ξ acts on F ϑ̂⊗Xi as
                                       (f ⊗ ξ)ωi,ϑ := f ϑ̂⊗(ξ)ωi ,
                                             ωi,ϑ
giving the component F ⊗K L ≀ G               -      EndF F ϑ̂⊗Xi of the Wedderburn isomorphism.
A block of (L ≀ G)ω splits under F ⊗K − into

Now, f ⊗ ϕ corresponds to (f ⊗ ϕa,b )a,b∈[1,xi ] , then to ((f ϑ̂(−)ϕa,b )a,b∈[1,xi ] )ϑ , hence finally
to (f ϑ̂⊗ϕ)ϑ .

Lemma 1.13 Given i ∈ [1, k], ϑ ∈ Θi and ϕ ∈ EndKi Xi , we have

                                          TrF (1 ϑ̂⊗ϕ) = trKi /K TrKi ϕ .

In fact,
                              TrF (1 ϑ̂⊗ϕ)        =                                     TrF (1 ϑ̂(−)ϕa,a )

Lemma 1.14 Suppose given i ∈ [1, k] and ϑ ∈ Θi . We have xi di /h ∈ Z. Moreover, given
z ∈ Z(Ki ) ⊆ EndKi Xi , we have
                                                              

We decompose F ϑ̂⊗Xi = ⊕λ∈H (F ϑ̂⊗Xi )eλ as F -vectorspaces. Since (F ϑ̂⊗Xi )eλ ≃
(F ϑ̂⊗Xi )eσ−1 λ for σ ∈ G via multiplication with σ, using eµ σ = σeσ−1 µ , the F -linear
dimension of (F ϑ̂⊗Xi )eµ is given by xi di/h. Now,

                         TrF ((eµ )ωi,ϑ ) =    λ∈H TrF ((eµ )ωi,ϑ |(F ϑ̂ ⊗Xi )eλ )

                                          = TrF ((eµ )ωi,ϑ |(F ϑ̂⊗Xi )eµ )
                                          = xi di /h .

Lemma 1.15 Given m ≥ 1 and A, B ∈ (F )m , we have TrF (A(−)B) = TrF (A)TrF (B),
where A(−)B denotes the F -linear endomorphism of (F )m that sends C ∈ (F )m to ACB,
and where TrF (A) denotes the trace of A as an element of (F )m .

Proposition 1.16 (Plancherel formula) Given ξ, η ∈ L ≀ G, we have

1.2       Conclusions
Corollary 1.17 The quotient xi di /h ∈ Z is invertible in K for any i ∈ [1, k].
If xi di /h = 0 in K, then the bilinear form (−, =) on L ≀ G would be degenerate by (1.16).
This is not the case, and so the result follows. Cf. (1.14).

In particular, ε1 = n−1              ν.

To evaluate ε1 , it suffices to remark that for y ∈ L and σ ∈ G, the K-linear trace of (yσ)ω1
is given by {σ ∈ N}TrL/K (y), as to be calculated as L-linear trace on L ⊗K L ≃ λ∈H L

      and it remains to be shown that l∈[1,h] yl∗,λ yl = ∂λ,1 . Since the left hand side is indepen-
                                         P
      dent of the choice ofQthe basis, we may tensor with L⊗K − and use the primitive idempotent
      basis of L ⊗K L ≃ µ∈H L, which is self dual. Orthogonality of these idempotents yields
      the result, for λ 6= 1 permutes them without fixed points.


      Question 1.24 Suppose N = 1. Given f ∈ H 2 (G, L∗ ), there is a central simple K-algebra
      L ≀f G (denoted (L/K, f ) in [20, 29.6]). If f is trivial, (1.18) or (1.23) allow to deduce an
      orthogonal primitive idempotent decomposition. I do not know such a decomposition in
      the general case, nor a workable description of the simple module (as an L-vectorspace with
      compatible G-operation, say). Cf. [20, 29.22, 32.19], [26, 2.4].



1.3     A Morita equivalence

Lemma 1.25 Considering L ≀ G as a left module over LN, we have an isomorphism

Since both source and target are of dimension gh over L, it suffices to prove injec-
tivity. Suppose given an element σ∈G, i∈Iσ yσ,i ⊗ zσ,i σ that is mapped to zero. From

Corollary 1.26 L ⊗K L ≀ G is Morita equivalent to LN.
Concerning the situation over K, cf. (1.34, 1.36, 1.37).


Corollary 1.27 The field L(ζexp(N ) ) is a splitting field for L ≀ G over K.
By (1.25), we have L(ζexp(N ) ) ⊗K L ≀ G ≃ (L(ζexp(N ) )N)h , and L(ζexp(N ) ) is a splitting field
for N by [22, 12.3, cor. to th. 24]. Cf. also (1.36).

1.4    The center of L ≀ G
Let ClGN ⊆ N denote a set of representatives of the G-orbits of N by conjugation. Given
σ ∈ N, we let hσ := h/|CG (σ)N/N| = g/|CG (σ)N|. Let (yσ,i )i∈[1,hσ ] be a K-linear basis
of Lσ := FixCG (σ) L ⊆ L, where σ ∈ ClG
                                      N.

Suppose given σ∈G σtσ ∈ Z(L≀G). For any y ∈ L, we have y(                                        σtσ )−(             σtσ )y =

we conclude that tσρ = tρσ for all σ ∈ N. Letting ρ ∈ CG (σ), we conclude that tσ ∈ Lσ for
all σ ∈ ClG
          N.


Corollary 1.29 ([15, Satz 2]) The K-linear dimension of the center Z(L ≀ G), i.e.
 l∈[1,k] dimK Z(Kl ), equals the number of conjugacy classes of N.
P

First proof. We let G act on the set of conjugacy classes of N, the G-orbits being repre-
sented by the N-orbits of the elements of ClG                                           G
                                             N . The stabilizer of the N-orbit of σ ∈ ClN
in G is given by CG (σ)N. But the dimension of Z(L ≀ G) over K is given by
                                     X              X
                                            hσ =            g/|CG (σ)N|,
                                    σ∈ClG
                                        N          σ∈ClG
                                                       N


which is the sum of the orbit lengths of this operation, indexed by representatives of orbit
representatives.
                                                                                        (1.26)
Second proof. We have dimK Z(L ≀ G) = dimL Z(L ⊗K L ≀ G) = dimL Z(LN).

Corollary 1.30 If K = Ki for all i ∈ [1, k], the number of irreducible modules of L ≀ G
is given by number of conjugacy classes of N.

Corollary 1.31 Given i ∈ [1, k], we have χi (σy) = 0 if σ 6∈ N. If σ ∈ N, then
                                                                                −1
                                    yl∗,ρχi (yl σ) =                  yl∗ χi (ylρ σ) .
                           X                                    X

                          l∈[1,h]                           l∈[1,h]


for ρ ∈ G.
The primitive central idempotent εi described in (1.22) is contained in Z(L ≀ G), so that
the result follows by (1.28).
14


Assumption 1.32 For all ν ∈ N, we have CG (ν) · N = G.
This assumption holds if N = 1, if N = G, or if N ≤ Z(G).

Lemma 1.33 (cf. [2, p. 21]) If (1.32) holds, then Z(KN) = Z(L ≀ G).
                                         ρ
Consider a basis element ρ∈CG (σ)\G σ ρ yσ,i of L ≀ G as in (1.28). Since Lσ = K by (1.32),
                             P

we may assume yσ,i = 1. By (1.32), the G-orbits and the N-orbits on N coincide. Thus
our basis element equals the class sum ρ∈CN (σ)\N σ ρ ∈ Z(KN).
                                        P


Corollary 1.34 If (1.32) holds, and if moreover all endomorphism rings of simple mod-
ules of KN and of L ≀ G are commutative, then KN and L ≀ G are Morita equivalent.
Concerning the situation after scalar extension over K to L, cf. (1.26). Cf. also (1.36,
1.37).


1.5    (Counter)examples
      Example 1.35 Suppose given a prime p ≥ 3, and let ζp2 be a primitive p2 th root of unity
                                                                   p
      over Q. Let πp2 ∈ Q(ζp2 ) be defined by πp2 := j∈[1,p−1] (ζpj2 − 1). Let ζp := ζpp2 .
                                                    Q

      Consider the operation of Cp2 on Q(πp2 ) given by composition of the surjection Cp2 - Cp
      with the operation of the Galois group over Q. Let σ be a generator of Cp2 , let z ∈ Q(πp2 ).
      The principal module is given by

                                   Q(πp2 ) ≀ Cp2      -     EndQ Q(πp2 )
                                               σ      -     (y - y σ )
                                               z      -     (y - yz) .

      Moreover, Q(ζp2 ) becomes a module by means of

                                 Q(πp2 ) ≀ Cp2      -     EndQ(ζp ) Q(ζp2 )
                                             σ      -     (y - y σ ζp2 )
                                             z      -     (y - yz),

      where Cp2 operates on Q(ζp2 ) via composition of the surjection Cp2 - Cp with the opera-
      tion of the Galois group Cp of Q(ζp2 ) over Q(ζp ), so that σ maps ζp2 to ζp1+p
                                                                                   2  . The element
      σ p is mapped to the multiplication with
                                                             p
                                                               
                                                           p+ 2 p
                                 NQ(ζp2 )/Q(ζp ) (ζp2 ) = ζp2       = ζpp2 .
                      2
      In particular, σ p is mapped to the identity.
      We claim that Q(ζp2 ) is a simple module not isomorphic to Q(πp2 ), more precisely, we
      claim its endomorphism ring to be equal to Q(ζp ). Since such an endomorphism is re-
      quired to commute with Q(πp2 ) and with σ p , it is determined by the image y of 1. Then
      commutativity with σ yields y = y σ . As Wedderburn isomorphism, we obtain
                                                   ω
                                  Q(πp2 ) ≀ Cp2    -
                                                   ∼    (Q)p × (Q(ζp ))p ,

      since this surjection is actually an isomorphism for dimension reasons. So in this case QCp
      and Q(πp2 ) ≀ Cp2 are in fact Morita equivalent, as shown by construction of the progenerator
      Q(πp2 ) ⊕ Q(ζp2 ) (cf. 1.34).
                                                                                                           15


      Example 1.36 Let G = S3 , N = C3 , L = Q(i), K = Q, where i(1,2) = −i. We note that
      (1.32) fails, since CG ((1, 2, 3)) = N . According to (1.28), the center of Q(i) ≀ S3 has the
      basis (1, (1, 2, 3)+ (1, 3, 2), i(1, 2, 3)− i(1, 3, 2)). Thus we have an isomorphism of Q-algebras
                                             √             ∼-
                             Q      ×     Q( 3)                    Z(Q(i) ≀ S3 )
                                                                   1
                             1      ×     0                -
                                                                   3 (1 + (1, 2, 3) + (1, 3, 2))
                                                                   1
                             0      ×     1                -
                                                                   3 (2 − (1, 2, 3) − (1, 3, 2))

      In particular, Z(L ≀ G) is not isomorphic to Z(KN ) (cf. 1.33 and 1.34). Moreover, K(ζ|G| )
      is not a splitting field for the K-algebra L ≀ G (but cf. 1.27).


      Example 1.37 Let G = Q8 = hi, j | i4 , j 4 , i2 = j 2 , ij = ji3 i be the quaternion group with
      8 elements, N = hi2 i ≤ Z(G), L = Q(ζ8 ), K = Q, ζ8i = ζ8−1 , ζ8j = ζ83 . We remark that
      (1.32) is fulfilled. We have an idempotent

                                                  1 − i2 1 + ζ8 j

2     Locally integral
Notation 2.1 Let S ⊆ K be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions K, maximal
ideal generated by π and residue field S̄ := S/πS of characteristic p ≥ 0. The π-adic
valuation of an element y ∈ K is denoted by v(y). Let T ⊆ L be the integral closure
of S in L. Note that T is a principal ideal domain. Let π s S := TrL/K (T ). We have
                                                                                                  17


πT = i∈[1,d] qei , where the qi ⊆ T denote the maximal ideals, forming a single Galois
       Q

orbit, and where e is the ramification index of π in T [16, I.§9]. Recall that π is said to
be tamely ramified in T if T /qi is separable over S̄ for some (hence for all) i ∈ [1, d], and
if, in addition, the ramification index e of π in T is not divisible by p. Otherwise, it is
said to be wildly ramified.


2.1    Projectivity

Lemma 2.2 (Maschke locally) For S-free T ≀ G-modules X and Y , we have
π s n · Ext1T ≀G (Y, X) = 0. In particular, if ε is a central idempotent of L ≀ G, we have
π s nε ∈ T ≀ G.
Let u0 ∈ T be such that TrL/K (u0 ) = π s . Consider an extension

                                                          f
                                0       -   X   -   E      -   Y    -      0
                                                                     i0             f
of T ≀ G-modules. We choose a T -linear coretraction Y               -E        to E - Y and let
                                            i
                                    Y       -   E
                                                X
                                    y       -         (yσ)i0 · u0 σ −1 ,
                                                σ∈G


which is T ≀ G-linear and satisfies if = π s n · 1Y .
                                                     f
Applying this construction to the epimorphism T ≀G - εT ≀G given by left multiplication
with ε, the map i sends ε to an element of the form ξ = ξε ∈ T ≀ G. Composition with f
                   ε central
yields π s nε = εξε = ξε ∈ T ≀ G.


Corollary 2.3 Given i ∈ [1, k], σ ∈ G and l ∈ [1, h], we have π s xihdi yl∗ χi (yl σ) ∈ T .
Apply (2.2) to (1.22).


Proposition 2.4 (Speiser, E. Noether, see [11, I.§3, Th. 3])
The following assertions are equivalent.

  (i) As a module over T ≀ G, T is projective.

 (ii) As a module over SG, T is projective.

(iii) The prime p does not divide n, and the trace TrL/K maps T onto S.

 (iv) The prime p does not divide n, and π is tamely ramified in T .

Assertion (i) implies (ii) since T ≀ G is free over SG. We claim that (ii) implies (i). Given
a split SG-linear epimorphism (SG)(i) - T , we obtain a split T ≀ G-linear epimorphism
18


(T ≀ G)(i) - T ⊗SG T ≀ G when tensoring with T ≀ G over SG. But the T ≀ G-linear
epimorphism (the counit of the tensor adjunction)

                                   T ⊗SG T ≀ G          -    T
                                   y ⊗ σz               -    yσz
                                   1 ⊗ z                    z

is T ≀ G-linearly split as indicated.
We claim equivalence of (i) and (iii). As a module over T ≀ G, T is projective if and only
if the T ≀ G-linear epimorphism
                                              η
                                      T ≀G    - T

                                          1   - 1

                                        ϕ
is split by some coretraction T ≀G  T . Amongst the T -linear maps from T to T ≀G, those
are T ≀ G-linear that send 1 to y σ∈G σ for some y ∈ T . But this map is a coretraction
                                   P

to η if and only if n · TrL/K y = 1.
We claim equivalence of (iii) and (iv). Reducing modulo π, the surjectivity of the trace
in question is equivalent to the nonvanishing of the S̄-linear trace on some factor T /qei of
T̄ . This trace in turn equals e times the trace on T /qi , by a filtration argument. Finally,
the trace on T /qi does not vanish if and only if T /qi is separable over S̄.

Remark 2.5

  (i) If the equivalent conditions of (2.4) are fulfilled, then T ≃SG SH [9, 32.1].

 (ii) If N = 1, another proof of (2.4), (iii ⇒ i) can be obtained by [9, 28.7], and by
      noting that T ≃ ( σ∈G σ)T ≀ G ⊆ T ≀ G is a right ideal.
                       P



2.2     The Wedderburn colength
      We give a formula for the colength of the Wedderburn embedding of twisted group rings
      (2.15), following basically the method of Plesken [19] (that G. Nebe taught me).


Notation 2.6 For each i ∈ [1, k], we choose a finitely generated T ≀ G-module Vi ⊆ Xi
such that KVi = Xi and such that Si := EndT ≀G Vi is a maximal order in Ki (cf. 2.7). In
particular, we choose V1 = T ⊆ L = X1 , so that S1 = S. Note that Si is finitely generated
free as a module over S, and that KSi = Ki , since Si = EndS Vi ∩ Ki ⊆ EndK Xi . Note
that Vi is free as a module over Si [20, 18.7 (i)], of rank xi . We fix Si -linear bases for Vi ,
i ∈ [1, k], and write Si - (resp. Ki -) linear endomorphisms of Vi (resp. of Xi ) as matrices
over Si (resp. over Ki ), i.e. as elements of (Si )xi (resp. of (Ki )xi ). In particular, we identify
EndSi Vi = (Si )xi .

Remark 2.7 The required choice of Vi ⊆ Xi can be achieved as follows. Let Si be a
maximal order in Ki (1.4), [20, 7.18 (ii), 10.4]. The S-subalgebra Ξ of EndK Xi generated
                                                                                                    19


by Si and the image of T ≀ G therein, is finitely generated as a module over S. Let Vi be
a finitely generated Ξ-submodule of Xi such that KVi = Xi . Since Si ⊆ EndT ≀G Vi ⊆ Ki ,
maximality of Si yields Si = EndT ≀G Vi .

Notation 2.8 Given a finitely generated torsion S-module M, we denote by l(M) the
length of M in the sense of Jordan-Hölder. Given an inclusion of S-modules N ⊆ M such
that M/N is a finitely generated torsion S-module, the colength of N in M is defined to
be the length l(M/N), i.e. the multiplicity of S̄ in M/N.
We write shorthand
                                           A := L ≀ G
                                           Λ := T ≀ G .
The K-bilinear form on A defined in (1.6) restricts to an S-bilinear form on Λ. For an
S-submodule U ⊆ A, we let

                               U ♯ := {y ∈ A | (y, U) ⊆ S} ⊆ A

be its dual S-submodule.

Lemma 2.9 For a finitely generated S-submodule U of A such that KU = A, the module
U ♯ is also a finitely generated S-submodule of A such that KU ♯ = A. In this case, we
obtain
                                       U = U ♯♯ .
Therefore U - U ♯ is an antiinvolution of the lattice U f of finitely generated S-submodules
of A such that KU = A. In particular, given U, V ∈ U f , U ⊆ V , we have l(V /U) =
l(U ♯ /V ♯ ).
We choose two S-linear bases (ui)i∈[1,gh] and (u′i )i∈[1,gh] of U such that (ui , u′j ) = ∂i,j zi for
some zi ∈ K ∗ , i, j ∈ [1, gh]. We obtain S-linear bases (zi−1 ui)i∈[1,gh] and (zi−1 u′i )i∈[1,gh] of
U ♯ . With respect to these bases, we have (zi−1 ui , zj−1 u′j ) = ∂i,j zi−1 , i, j ∈ [1, gh]. Hence by
the same argument, applied to this situation, we obtain U ♯♯ = U.

Notation 2.10 Suppose given i ∈ [1, k]. Let

                                Si+ := {y ∈ Ki | trK (ySi ) ⊆ S} .

The colength of Si in Si+ is denoted by

                                        δSi /S := l(Si+ /Si ) .

Furthermore, let
                               T + := {y ∈ L | TrL/K (yT ) ⊆ S}
                              δT /S := l(T + /T )

We use (1.16) to apply the bilinear form on the right hand side of the Wedderburn
isomorphism to a tuple of matrices with only one nonzero matrix which in turn has only
one nonzero entry, and an arbitrary tuple.

Let

3     Modular

3.1     Brauer-Nesbitt
Corollary 3.1 (to 1.19) Let i ∈ [1, k]. Suppose that K = Ki and that v(xi ) = v(g) + t
(cf. 2.19, 2.21). Then the reduction Vi /πVi is a simple T̄ ≀ G-module.
Assume Vi /πVi to have a nontrivial submodule. Choose an S-linear basis of Vi such that
v ((σyl )ωi; xi ,1 ) > 0 for all σ ∈ G, l ∈ [1, h]. Then
                             g (1.19)
                                                   (σyl )ωi; xi ,1 · (yl∗σ −1 )ωi; 1,xi .
                                           X
                                  =
                             xi       l∈[1,h], σ∈G

Now the left hand side has valuation −t, whereas the right hand side has valuation > −t.
This contradicts our assumption, and therefore Vi /πVi is simple.

Remark 3.2 The S̄-algebra T̄ ≀ G is semisimple if and only if e = 1, T /q1 is separable
over S̄ and p does not divide n. We have e = 1 if and only if t = 0.
For the necessity of these three conditions, we consider the split epimorphisms T̄ - T̄0 ,
which implies that e = 1, and T̄ ≀ G - T̄ , which then implies that T /q1 is separable over
S̄ and that p does not divide n (cf. 2.4).
First of all, if e = 1 and T /q1 is separable over S̄, then TrT̄ /S̄ (T̄ ) = S̄ (cf. 2.4). Sufficiency
now follows as in (2.2), using an element ū0 ∈ T̄ such that TrT̄ /S̄ (ū0 ) = 1.
We have t = 0 if and only if T + = T , i.e. if and only if the discriminant of T /S is invertible
in S. By [16, III.2.12], this holds if and only if e = 1.

Remark 3.3 Let i ∈ [1, k]. If T̄ ≀ G is semisimple and if K = Ki , then the reduction
Vi /πVi is a simple T̄ ≀ G-module.
By (3.1), we have to show that v(xi ) = v(h) + v(n) + t. Now t = 0 and v(n) = 0 by (3.2),
v(xi ) ≥ v(h) by (1.14) and v(xi ) ≤ v(h) by (2.21).

      Question 3.4 Suppose T̄0 ≀ G to be semisimple. For instance, this is the case if T̄ ≀ G is
      semisimple (3.2). Then Jac(T̄ ≀ G) = Jac(T )(T̄ ≀ G), being a nilpotent ideal with semisim-
      ple quotient. Are the isoclasses of simple T̄ ≀ G-modules represented by Vi /Jac(T )Vi for
      i ∈ [1, k] ? Cf. [9, §28, ex. 5].



3.2    Counting simple modules
      The arguments in this section are an adaption of Brauer’s proof of the classical case
      [3, 3B].


Notation 3.5 Recall from (2.1) that we write S̄ = S/πS.
Assume S̄ to be finite, and let S̄ =: pa =: q.
On the other hand, in this section we may admit n · 1K = 0.
Denote T̄ := T /πT and q̄i := qi /πT . Note that T̄ ≃                                     T̄qi ≃                  T /qei .

      have an injective S̄-linear map

from former notation, we let Cl(G) be a system of representatives of conjugacy classes of G,
and let Cl(G, p′ ) := {σ ∈ Cl(G) | o(σ) 6≡p 0} ⊆ Cl(G) be the subset of p′ -representatives.
Given σ ∈ Cl(G), we define the subspace

Case eτj 6= ej . Then eτj = ej ′ for some j ′ 6= j since τ preserves primitive idempotents.
Therefore, τ y = τ yej ≡[Λ̄,Λ̄] ej τ y = τ yeτj = 0.

note that CG (σ q ) = CG (σ), and so Vσqµ = Vσ . Since z - z q is an automorphism on T̄0 ,
the endomorphism it induces on T̄0 /Vσ is an automorphism, too.

Theorem 3.14 We have

Corollary 3.15 The number of isoclasses of simple Λ̄-modules is less than or equal to
z(Λ).

Corollary 3.16 Suppose Λ̄/Jac(Λ̄) to be split semisimple over S̄, i.e. suppose all simple
Λ̄-modules to be absolutely simple. Then the number of isoclasses of simple Λ̄-modules is
given by z(Λ).

We may reformulate (3.16) to an assertion on T ≀ G.

Corollary 3.17 Suppose all simple T ≀ G-modules to be absolutely simple. Then the
number of isoclasses of indecomposable projective T ≀ G-modules is given by z(T ≀ G).

Remark 3.18 (particular cases) We drop the finiteness assumption on S̄.

  (i) The T̄ ≀ G-module T̄0 is simple, with endomorphism ring EndT̄ ≀G T̄0 ≃ FixCH (q1 ) T /q1 .
      If T /q1 is separable over S̄, then T̄0 is absolutely simple, i.e. EndT̄ ≀G T̄0 = S̄. Cf.
      (3.21).

 (ii) If G is a p-group, then T̄0 is the only simple Λ̄-module, up to isomorphism. In
      particular, if S̄ is finite, (3.14) yields dimS̄ T̄0 /V1 = dimS̄ FixG T̄0 .

 (iii) If S̄ is finite, and if G acts trivially on T̄0 , then z(Λ) = |Cl(G, p′ )| · dimS̄ T̄0 (3.14).

 (iv) Suppose d = 1. Write N0 for the kernel of the operation of G on T̄0 . If σ ∈ G is
      not contained in N0 , then T̄0 /Vσ = 0. Cf. (1.29).

  (v) Suppose G to be a p′ -group. Then T̄0 ≀ G is semisimple. In particular, if in addition
      T /S is unramified, then Λ̄ = T̄ ≀ G is semisimple.

 (vi) The isoclasses of simple modules of Λ̄ = T̄ ≀ G correspond bijectively to the isoclasses
      of simple modules of T̄0 ≀ G via composition of the operation with T̄ ≀ G - T̄0 ≀ G.
      Moreover, we have an isomorphism (T̄ ≀ G)/Jac(T̄ ≀ G) ∼- (T̄0 ≀ G)/Jac(T̄0 ≀ G).

(vii) If e = 1 and if T /q1 is separable over S̄, then V1 has codimension 1 in T̄0 .

(viii) The S̄-linear dimension of a T̄ ≀ G-module is divisible by dimS̄ T̄0 = h/e.

Ad (i). Firstly, EndT̄ ≀G T̄0 ≃ FixG T̄0 . Now the projection of FixG T̄0 to T /q1 is injective
and surjects onto FixCH (q1 ) T /q1 . If the extension T /q1 over S̄ is separable, we obtain a
surjection of CH (q1 ) onto Gal((T /q1 )/S̄) [16, I.9.4].
Ad (ii). Any Λ̄-module M contains a fixed point different from 0. In fact, passing to a
cyclic module, we may assume it to be finite, of cardinality divisible by p. Since p divides
the length of a nontrivial G-orbit, the claim follows. Cf. [22, prop. 26].
Let m ∈ M be a nonzero fixed point. Then m · T̄ is a submodule of M. Hence, if M is
simple, M is isomorphic to a quotient of T̄ . But the only simple quotient of T̄ is T̄0 .
                                                                                                         29


Ad (iv). By assumption, there exists a y ∈ T̄0 such that y σ − y 6= 0. The subspace Vσ of
T̄0 contains the ideal generated by y σ − y. Since now T̄0 is a field, this implies Vσ = T̄0 .
Ad (v). Given an epimorphism of Λ̄-modules, we may choose a T̄0 -linear coretraction,
for T̄0 is semisimple. The sum over the G-conjugates divided by |G| yields a Λ̄-linear
coretraction.
Ad (vi). The kernel of T̄ ≀ G - T̄0 ≀ G is a nilpotent ideal, thus contained in Jac(T̄ ≀ G).
Ad (vii). By tameness of T /S, (2.4) and [9, 32.1] show that T̄0 |S̄H ≃ S̄H. Under such an
isomorphism, V1 corresponds to the augmentation ideal.
Ad (viii). We are reduced to consider a simple T̄ ≀G-module X. Let ej correspond to (∂j,i)i
under T̄0 ∼- i∈[1,d] T /qi . We may decompose X as a T̄0 -module into X = j∈[1,d] Xej .
                Q                                                            L

Since G acts transitively on {ej | j ∈ [1, d]}, we have for each j ∈ [1, d] an element
σ ∈ G that induces Xe1 ∼- Xej by multiplication. Since Xe1 is a module over T /q1 ,
d · dimS̄ T /q1 = dimS̄0 T̄0 divides dimS̄ X.


3.3      Examples
       When we count simple modules, we shall tacitly count them up to isomorphism. We use
       Maple, Magma and the Meat Axe version of M. Ringe [21].

       Example 3.19 We continue (1.36).

      p = 2. Let S = Z(2) and T = Z(2) [i]. Since T̄0 ≃ F2 , the simple T̄ ≀ G-modules are given by
             the two simple F2 S3 -modules (3.18 iii).
      p = 3. Let S = Z(3) and T = Z(3) [i]. Now T̄ = T̄0 = F3 [i] ≃ F9 . We obtain V1 = F3 hii and
             V(1,2) = F3 [i]. Therefore z(Z(3) [i] ≀ S3 ) = 1, and thus T̄0 is the unique (absolutely)
             simple T̄ ≀ G-module (3.18 i).

       Example 3.20 Let K = Q. Let γ be a root of the irreducible polynomial

                       µ(X) = X 6 − 3X 5 + 7X 4 − 9X 3 + 7X 2 − 3X + 1 ∈ Q[X] ,

       and let L = Q(γ). Then Z[γ] is the ring of algebraic integers in the Galois extension L/K.
       We have Gal(L/K) ≃ S3 . Thus there is an operation of S4 on L, where

                                                γ (1,2)    = 1−γ
                                            γ (1,2,3,4)    = 1/γ .

      p = 2. Let S = Z(2) and T = Z(2) [γ]. We have µ(X) ≡2 (X 3 + X + 1)(X 3 + X 2 + 1), hence
             T̄ = T̄0 ≃ F8 × F8 . Let Fx = x2 for x ∈ F8 . The operation of S4 on T̄0 is given by

                                       F8   ×    F8         -     F8   ×   F8
                                                          (1,2)
                                        x ×      y          -      y   ×   x
                                                      (1,2,3,4)
                                        x ×      y          -     Fy   ×   F2 x .

             Let α ∈ F8 with α3 + α + 1 = 0. Then V1 = F2 h1 × 1, α × 0, α2 × 0, 0 × α, 0 × α2 i (cf.
             3.18 vii), and V(1,2,3) = T̄0 . Altogether, z(T ≀ G) = 1. Therefore, T̄0 = T̄ is the only
             (absolutely) simple T̄ ≀ G-module (3.14, 3.18 i).
30


      p = 3. Let S = Z(3) and T = Z(3) [γ]. We have µ(X) ≡3 (X 2 + 1)(X 2 + X − 1)(X 2 − X − 1),
             hence T̄ = T̄0 ≃ F9 × F9 × F9 . Let Fx = x3 for x ∈ F9 . The operation of S4 on T̄0 is
             given by
                              F9 × F9 × F9            - F9 × F9 × F9
                                                         (1,2)
                                   x ×    y    × z          -        y    ×   x       × Fz
                                                        (1,2,3,4)
                                   x ×    y    × z          -       Fx ×      z       × y.
             Choose ι ∈ F9 with ι2 + 1 = 0. Then V1 = F3 h1 × −1 × 0, 0 × 1 × −1, ι × 0 × 0, 0 × ι ×
             0, 0 × 0 × ιi (cf. 3.18 vii). Moreover, V(1,2)(3,4) = F3 hι × 0 × 0, 0 × 1 × −1, 0 × ι × −ιi.
             Finally, V(1,2) = V(1,2,3,4) = T̄0 . Altogether, z(T ≀ G) = 4. It turns out that there are
             three simple T̄ ≀ G-modules, two of dimension 6 and endomorphism ring F3 , and one of
             dimension 12 and endomorphism ring F9 . In particular, the center of T̄ ≀ G/Jac(T̄ ≀ G)
             is isomorphic to F3 × F3 × F9 . It is of dimension 4 over F3 , as predicted by (3.14).
     p = 31. Let S = Z(31) and T = Z(31) [γ]. We have µ(X) ≡31 (X − 2)2 (X + 15)2 (X + 1)2 , hence
             T̄ ≃ F31 [ε] × F31 [ε] × F31 [ε], where ε2 = 0. In particular, T̄0 ≃ F31 × F31 × F31 . The
             operation of S4 on T̄0 is given by

                             F31    ×    F31   × F31        -       F31   × F31        ×   F31
                                                          (1,2)
                                x ×      y     × z          -         z   ×       y    ×   x
                                                        (1,2,3,4)
                                x ×      y     × z          -        y    ×       x    ×   z.

             We obtain V1 = F31 h1 × −1 × 0, 1 × 0 × −1i, V(1,2) = F31 × 0 × F31 , V(1,2)(3,4) =
             F31 h1 × 0 × −1i, V(1,2,3) = T̄0 and V(1,2,3,4) = F31 × F31 × 0. Altogether, z(T ≀ G) = 5.
             In fact, there are 5 absolutely simple T̄ ≀ G-modules, four of dimension 3 and one of
             dimension 6.


       Example 3.21 Let G = H = C2 = hci, let L = Q(X), let X c = −X, so that K = Q(X 2 ).
       Let p := 2Z[X 2 ] ⊆ Z[X 2 ], let S = Z[X 2 ]p , hence T = Z[X]p . We obtain S̄ = F2 (X 2 ) and
       T̄ = T̄0 = F2 (X). In particular, c acts trivially on T̄0 , so EndT̄ ≀G T̄0 = F2 (X). Therefore, T̄0
       is simple, but not absolutely simple over the S̄-algebra T̄ ≀ G.
