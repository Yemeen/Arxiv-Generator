                                                     Abstract. Using the polytopes defined in an earlier paper, we show
                                                     in this paper the existence of degeneration of a large class of Schubert
                                                     varieties of SLn to toric varieties by extending the method used by
                                                     Goncuilea and Lakshmibai for a miniscule G/P to Schubert varieties in
                                                     SLn .




                                                                               Introduction
                                                In this paper, we complete our programme stated in [2] to prove the
                                             existence of degenerations of certain Schubert varieties of SLn into toric
                                             varieties, thus generalizing the results of Goncuilea and Lakshmibai [4]. For
                                             example, we are able to settle all the Schubert varieties in SL3 here.
                                                The essential idea is that we use the polytopes defined in [2] to construct
                                             a distributive lattice, and extend the method used by Goncuilea and Lak-
                                             shmibai [4] for miniscule G/P to Schubert varieties in SLn . Although they
                                             also prove the existence of degenerations for SLn /P (and also Kempf va-
                                             rieties) in the same paper, their approach is different from the one for a
                                             miniscule G/P .
                                                Since all the ingredients used here are based on standard monomials, we
                                             expect that it can be adapted in the other types. However, the difficult
                                             part is to construct a suitable distributive lattice and we shall make it more
                                             precise below.
                                                Let G = SLn+1 , B be a Borel subgroup and W be the Weyl group of
                                             G which is the symmetric group of n + 1 letters. Let αi , i = 1, · · · , n, be
                                             the corresponding set of simple roots so that hαi , α∨ j i = ai,j where (ai,j )i,j
                                             is the Cartan matrix, si the corresponding simple reflections in W and let
                                             ωi be the corresponding fundamental weights. Denote also by ℓ(−) and 
                                             the length function and the Bruhat order on W .
                                                Recall that for w ∈ W , the Demazure module Ew (λ) is the b-module
                                             U (b)vwλ , where b is the Lie algebra of B, U (b) its envelopping algebra
                                             and vwλ a vector of extremal weight
                                                                              Pn       wλ of the irreducible representation
                                             V (λ) of highest weight λ =         i=1 i ωi , ki ≥ 0. Under certain condi-

sum ni=1 ki ∆i = { ni=1 kj=1        xij | xij ∈ ∆i } is equal to the dimension of
Ew (λ). The polytopes ∆1 , . . . , ∆n define a toric variety X equipped with
n line bundles Li , i = 1, . . . , n (see [10]). The aim of this paper is to de-
generate the Schubert variety S(w) = BwB/B equipped with line bundles
Lωi = BwB ×B Cωi into X equipped with Li .
  We consider the homogeneous coordinate   Ln       ring of
                                                          Lna multicone over Sw .
This multicone is the Bτ B-orbit of              Cv ωi in   i=1 V (ω  ), and its co-

     P ring is R = λ dominant H (Sw , Lλ ), where Lλ = i=1 Lωi with

is surjective and its kernel IPis a multigraded ideal generated by elements
of degree (k1 , . . . , kn ) with i ki = 2. On the other hand, we encounter
an analogous situation considering the toric variety X defined by the poly-
topes ∆1 , . . . , ∆n . Let BP  k1 ,... ,kn be the vector space
                                                            L over C generated by

lattice points in polytopes ∆i , i = 1, . . . , n.
    The basic idea is that one can put a structure of a distributive lattice
on the set H, of lattice points of ∆1 , . . . , ∆n . This distributive lattice,
denoted H equipped with operations ∨, ∧, is such that for α, β ∈ H we
have α + β = α ∨ β + α ∧ β. Hence that the algebra C[H]/I(H), where
I(H) is the homogeneous ideal generated by xα xβ = xα∨β xα∧β , is the ring
S. Therefore using theorem 2.5 proved in [4], one obtains a flat deformation
of R to C[H]/I(H) which is the homogeneous coordinate ring of a multicone
over the toric variety X.
    The paper is organized as follows. In section 1, we recall results from [2].
The theorem of degeneration of [4] is stated in section 2. Sections 3,4 and
5 are devoted to showing that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied.
Finally in section 6, we discuss briefly which Schubert varieties fall into our
context.
    We shall use the above notations throughout this paper.

                          1. Distributive lattice on W w
   For a fundamental weight ωi , i = 1, . . . , n, let Wωi be the subgroup of the
Weyl group W , stabilizing ωi , that is Wωi = {τ ∈ W | τ (ωi ) = ωi }. Denote
the quotient W/Wωi by Wi . The set Wi can, on the one hand, be identi-
fied with the subset of W consisting of elements τ such that τ  τ sαj for
                                                   2
j 6= i, i.e. the set of minimal representatives and, on the other hand, with
the set of i-tuples (r1 , . . . , ri ) such that 0 ≤ r1 < · · · < ri ≤ n. The con-
nection between these two identifications is that (r1 , . . . , ri ) corresponds to
s(r1 , 1)s(r2 , 2) · · · s(ri , i) where s(a, b) = sa sa−1 · · · sb . The induced Bruhat
order on Wi , which we shall also denote by  can be expressed under the
above identifications by a = (a1 , . . . , ai )  b = (b1 , . . . , bi ) if and only if
ak ≤ bk , 1 ≤ k ≤ i. Furthermore, Wi becomes a distributive lattice (for
generalities on distributive lattices, see [5] or section 2 of [4]) under  where
                      a ∨ b = (max{a1 , b1 }, . . . , max{ai , bi })
                                                                                  (1.1)
                  and a ∧ b = (min{a1 , b1 }, . . . , min{ai , bi }).
   Recall (see for example [2]) that any w ∈ W has a unique factorization in
the form s(a1 , b1 )s(a2 , b2 ) · · · s(ak , bk ) with 1 ≤ a1 < a2 < · · · < ak ≤ n. We
shall be interested in the w’s satisfying b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bk .
   For an element w ∈ W , let Wiw = {τ ∈ W`                i | τ  w}, where w is the
representative of w in Wi . Denote by W w := ni=1 Wiw . Let us recall the
following partial order from section 8 of [2].
Definition 1.1. Let i ≤ j and w = s(a1 , b1 ) · · · s(ak , bk ), with 1 ≤ a1 <
· · · < ak ≤ n and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bk . For φ = (r1 , . . . , ri ) ∈ Wiw , we define
                 φ̆ := (0, 1, . . . , j − i − 1, r̆j−i+1 , . . . , r̆j ) ∈ Wjw
where r̆k = max{k − 1, rk−j+i }, j − i + 1 ≤ k ≤ j and for τ = (t1 , . . . , tj ) ∈
Wjw , let
                        τ̃ := (tj−i+1 , . . . , tj ) ∈ Wiw .
We say that φ w τ if φ̆  τ , or equivalently if φ  τ̃ , and we define
τ ∨ φ := τ ∨ φ̆ ∈ Wjw and τ ∧ φ := τ̃ ∧ φ ∈ Wiw (see Eq. 1.1).
  A simple consequence of the definition is the following lemma.
Lemma 1.2. Let w be as in definition 1.1. Then together with the above
operations, W w is a distributive lattice.
   An essential property of this partial order is the following theorem proved
in [2].
Theorem 1.3. We have φ w τ in W w if and only if there exist liftings φ′ ,
τ ′ in W of φ, τ such that φ′  τ ′  w.
  As we shall see in the next sections, this is used extensively in the proof.
Remark 1.4. In [2], we constructed for each fundamental weight ωi , a
polytope
Pn        ∆w i such that the number
                                P of lattice points in the Minkowski sum
      k  ∆ w is equal to dim E ( n k ω ). The set of vertices of the poly-
  i=1  i   i                  w   i=1 i i
tope ∆i is indexed by the set Wiw and these are the only lattice points of ∆i .
Moreover considering φ, τ ∈ W w as vertices, we have φ + τ = φ ∨ τ + φ ∧ τ .
The polytopes ∆i have also the important property that they canPbe trian-
gulized by simplices of minimal volume so that a lattice point of ni=1 ki ∆i
can be written as the sum of k1 lattice points of ∆1 and k2 lattice points
                                              3
of ∆2 and so on. This property gives information on the generators of the
toric ideal defined by the ∆i .
   We shall end this section by proving certain facts concerning τ ∨ φ and
τ ∧ φ which will be needed throughout the paper. These are generalizations
of certain results obtained in [4]. Let us suppose that w is as in definition 1.1.
Lemma 1.5. Let j ≥ i and φ ∈ Wiw , τ ∈ Wjw be two non-comparable
elements in W w . Let σ = τ ∨ φ and κ = τ ∧ φ. Then τ (ωj ) + φ(ωi ) =
σ(ωj ) + κ(ωi ).
Proof. This is just a direct consequence of the fact that φ + τ = φ ∨ τ + φ ∧ τ
in the polytope described in remark 1.4, see [2].
   It is also a straightforward computation by using the fact that if τ =
(t1 , . . . , tj ), then
                                          j
                                          X
                         τ (ωj ) = ωj −         (αk + · · · + αtk ).
                                          k=1




Lemma 1.6. Let j ≥ i and φ ∈ Wiw , τ ∈ Wjw with σ = τ ∨ φ and κ = τ ∧ φ.
Then, we have the following
  1. if si1 · · · sik τ = σ and ℓ(σ) = ℓ(τ ) + k, then si1 · · · sik κ̆ = φ̆ with
     ℓ(κ̆) + k = ℓ(φ̆); or equivalently si1 · · · sik κ = φ.
  2. if sj1 · · · sjl φ̆ = σ with ℓ(σ) = ℓ(φ̆) + l, then sj1 · · · sjl κ̆ = τ with ℓ(τ ) =
     ℓ(κ̆) + l.
  3. The sets {αip } and {αjq } has empty intersection and sip , sjq commute.

Proof. Note that as a consequence of Definition 1.1, we have σ = τ ∨ φ̆
and κ̆ = τ ∧ φ̆. Using lemmas 7.17 and 7.18 of [4], we conclude that there
exist αi1 , . . . , αik and αj1 , . . . , αjl all simple enjoying the properties stated
above.

                        2. Theorem on degeneration
  Let us recall some basic facts on standard monomials.
  Let φ ∈ Wi and φ = sir · · · si1 be a reduced expression for φ. Then the
vector Qφ := X−αir · · · X−αi1 vωi is an extremal weight vector in V (ωi ) of
weight φ(ωi ). It is shown in [9] that Qφ is independent of the choice of
reduced expression of φ. Further, we have the following lemmas from [9]:
Lemma 2.1. The set {Qτ | τ ∈ Wi , τ  w} is a Z-basis for EZ,w (ωi ).
  Let {Pτ | τ ∈ Wi } be the Z-basis of VZ∗ (ωi ) dual to {Qτ | τ ∈ Wi }. Then
the set {Pτ | τ ∈ Wi , τ  w} is a Z-basis for H 0 (SZ (w), LZ,ωi ) = EZ,w
                                                                       ∗ (ω ).
                                                                           i

Lemma 2.2. Let σ ≻ κ ∈ Wi and σ = sir · · · si1 κ and ℓ(σ) − ℓ(κ) = r.
Then we have Pκ = (−1)r X−αi1 · · · X−αir Pσ .
                                            4
  For a field k, let us denote the canonical image of Pw in H 0 (G/Pi , Lωi )
by pw , w ∈ Wi .
Definition 2.3. [9] A monomial pτr,kr · · · pτr,1 pτr−1,kr−1 · · · pτ1,1 , where τi,j ∈
                                                                             P
Wiw , is called homogeneous of degree (k1 , . . . , kr ) and of total degree rj=1 kj .
   It is called standard on S(w) if for each i, j, there exists τ̃i,j ∈ W , whose
class in Wi is τi,j , and τ̃1,1  · · ·  τ̃r,kr  w in W . In other words
pτr,kr · · · pτ1,1 is standard on S(w) if τ1,1 w · · · w τr,kr w w.

Theorem 2.4. [9]
 1. Let w ∈ W . Then, denoting w the representative of w in Wi , for
    τ ∈ Wi , pτ |S(w) 6= 0 if and only if τ  w. Furthermore, {pτ | τ ∈ Wiw }
    is a k-basis for H 0 (S(w), Lωi ).
 2. The standardNmonomials on S(w) of degree (k1 , . . . , kn ) form a basis
    of H 0 (S(w), ni=1 L⊗k ωi ).
                              i


   Let H be a finite distributive lattice. Denote by P = k[xα , α ∈ H] and
I(H) ⊂ P the ideal generated by the binomials {xα xβ −xα∨β xα∧β | α, β ∈ H
non-comparable}.
            L
   Let R = λ dominant H 0 (S(w), Lλ ) be the homogeneous coordinate ring
of a multicone over Sw . By the previous theorem, R has a basis indexed by
standard monomials on S(w). Thus we have the surjective map π : P → R
sending xα 7→ pα where we have H is the set of standard monomials on
S(w). Let I = ker π which is an ideal generated by relations in total degree
2 of the form
                                     X
                             pτ pφ −     cθψ pθ pψ                     (2.1)
where pτ pφ is non standard and the pθ pψ ’s are standard. These are called
straightening relations.
Theorem 2.5. [4] Assume that W w is a distributive lattice such that the
ideal I is generated by the straightening relations of the form
                                      X
                              pτ pφ −    cθψ pθ pψ                 (2.2)
where τ , φ are non-comparable and θ  ψ. Further, suppose that we have
  1. cτ ∨φ,τ ∧φ = 1, i.e. pτ ∨φ pτ ∧φ occurs on the right-hand side of eq. 2.2
     with coefficient 1.
  2. τ, φ ∈]ψ, θ[= {γ ∈ W w | ψ  γ  θ} for every pair (θ, ψ) appearing on
     the right-hand side of eq. 2.2.
  3. There exist integers n1 , . . . , nd ≥ 1 and an embedding of distributive
     lattices
                                       [n
                         ι : W w ֒→       C(n1 , . . . , nd )
                                       d=1
      where C(n1 , . . . , nd ) is the set of d-tuples (i1 , . . . , id ) with 1 ≤ ij ≤
      nj , such that for every pair (θ, ψ) appearing on the right-hand side of
                    ˙
      eq. 2.2, ι(τ )∪ι(φ)           ˙
                            = ι(θ)∪ι(ψ)   where ∪˙ denotes the disjoint union.
                                          5
Then there exists a flat deformation whose special fiber is P/I(W w ) and
whose general fiber is R.
   By lemma 1.2, if w is as in definition 1.1, then W w is a distributive lattice.
In the next sections, we shall prove that all the conditions of the theorem are
satisfied. Let us assume in the next sections that w is as in definition 1.1.

                     3. Condition (2) of Theorem 2.5
Theorem 3.1. ([8], [9]) Let i ≤ j, τ ∈ Wjw , φ ∈ Wiw and pτ pφ be a non
standard monomial on S(w). Let the corresponding straightening relation be
given by
                                         N
                                         X
                               pτ pφ =         cl pθl pψl .                      (3.1)
                                         l=1
Then τ, φ ≺w θl , ψl ≺w τ, φ for all l such that cl 6= 0.
Proof. The proof given here is just a generalization of the proof of propo-
sition 2.5 of [6]. Among the θi choose a minimal one, which we denote by
θ. Let us reindex the θl so that θ = θl for 1 ≤ l ≤ s. Note that since θ is
minimal we have θl 6 θ for s < l ≤ N . Since pθl pψl is standard, we can
         (l) (l)                   (l)     (l)                      (l)
choose κ1 , κ2 ∈ W such that κ2  κ1  w, the class of κ1 in Wj is θl
                    (l)                         S        (l)
and the class of κ1 in Wi is ψl . Let Z1 = sl=1 S(κ1 ) and restrict eq. 3.1
to Z1 . Then pθl pψl |Z1 is standard on Z1 for 1 ≤ l ≤ s and pθl pψl |Z1 ≡ 0
for s < l ≤ N . By the linear independence of standard monomials, eq. 3.1
                                                                              (l)
restricted to Z1 is not zero. Hence pτ pφ |Z1 6= 0. This implies that τ, φ ≺ κ1 .
According to Theorem 1.3 (or Lemma 8.12 of [2]) we have τ, φ w θ; note
that τ (or φ) can not be equal to θ, because pτ pφ is non standard. ¿From
this argument we deduce that τ, φ ≺w θl for all l.
   Let σ = τ ∨φ ∈ Wjw and κ = τ ∧φ ∈ Wiw . Now θl ∈ Wjw and ψl ∈ Wiw . By
weight consideration, we have σ(ωj ) + κ(ωi ) = θl (ωj ) + ψl (ωi ). Furthermore
τ, φ ≺w θl implies that σ w θl , or equivalently σ  θl since both belong to
Wj . Therefore θl (ωj ) ≤ σ(ωj ), which implies that κ(ωi ) ≤ ψl (ωi ). Therefore
ψl  κ. In other words ψl w κ ≺w τ, φ.

Corollary 3.2. Let the Pnotations be as in Lemma 1.5. Then in the straight-
ening relation pτ pφ =  cθψ pθ pψ , either σ ≺w θ or θ = σ, ψ = κ.
Proof. ¿From Theorem 3.1, we know that for any pair (θ, ψ) on the right-
hand side, σ w θ and ψ w κ. Moreover if σ = θ, then due to weight
considerations, i.e. θ(ωj ) + ψ(ωi ) = σ(ωj ) + κ(ωi ), we see that κ = ψ.

                         4. Condition (3) of Theorem 2.5
                                        `n
  Considering the set W w :=                   w
                                         i=1 Wi , we noted at the beginning of
                                w
Section 1 that each set Wi can be identified with the subset of i-tuples
(a1 , . . . , ai ) where 0 ≤ a1 < · · · < ai ≤ n and (a1 , . . . , ai ) is smaller than
                                          6
                                                            S
the representative of w in Wi . Hence we have ι : W w ֒→ nd=1 C(n1 , . . . , nd ).
For simplicity, we shall denote ι(τ ) also by τ . We want to prove the following
lemma:
Lemma 4.1. Let τ, φ be two non-comparable elements in W w . Then for
any (θ, ψ) appearing on the right-hand side of the straightening relation 2.2,
  ˙ = τ ∪φ.
θ ∪ψ     ˙

Proof. Let τ = (t1 , . . . , tj ), φ = (r1 , . . . , ri ), θ = (a1 , . . . , aj ) and ψ =
(b1 , . . . , bi ). A necessary condition for pθ pψ to appear on the right-hand side
of eq. 2.2 is τ (ωj ) + φ(ωi ) = θ(ωj ) + ψ(ωi ). Here, we shall prove that this
condition immediately implies the assertion, i.e. {t1 , . . . , tj }∪{r   ˙ 1 , . . . , ri } =
                     ˙
{a1 , . . . , aj , }∪{b1 , . . . , bi }. The proof is by induction on i + j.
   The fact that τ (ωj ) + φ(ωi ) = θ(ωj ) + ψ(ωi ) implies (see the proof of
lemma 1.5)
              j
              X                       i
                                      X
                (αk + · · · + αtk ) +   (αl + · · · + αrl ) =
              k=1                           l=1                                         (4.1)
                             j
                             X                       i
                                                     X
                               (αk + · · · + αak ) +   (αl + · · · + αbl )
                             k=1                            l=1

Note that
                      max{t1 , . . . , tj , r1 , . . . , ri } = max{tj , ri }
and that
                     max{a1 , . . . , aj , b1 , . . . , bi } = max{aj , bi }.
Then due to the equality in eq. 4.1, we must have max{tj , ri } = max{aj , bi }.
There are four cases to consider.
   • Case (1) tj = aj ≥ bi . This implies that αj + · · · + αtj = αj + · · · + αaj .
Hence denoting τ ′ = (t1 , . . . , tj−1 ) and θ ′ = (a1 , . . . , aj−1 ), eq. 4.1 implies
that τ ′ (ωj−1 ) + φ(ωi ) = θ ′ (ωj−1 ) + ψ(ωi ). By induction we are done.
   • Case (2) tj = bi > aj . Let m be the smallest number such that aj−m >
bi−m (if such an m less than i − 1 does not exist, let m = i). Note that
bi−m+1 ≥ aj−m+1 > aj−m > bi−m . Set
      τ ′ = (t1 , . . . , tj−1 ) ∈ Wj−1 ,
      θ ′ = (a1 , . . . , aj−m , bi−m+1 , bi−m+2 , . . . , bi−1 ) ∈ Wj−1 ,
      ψ ′ = (b1 , . . . , bi−m , aj−m+1 , aj−m+2 , . . . , aj ) ∈ Wi if m 6= i and
      ψ ′ = (aj−i+1 , . . . , aj ) if m = i.
Since i ≤ j, we have i − k − 1 ≤ j − k − 1 ≤ aj−k for 0 ≤ k < i. Therefore
ψ ′ ∈ Wi . Using the fact that for 0 ≤ k < m, we have i − k − 1 ≤ j − k − 1 ≤
aj−k ≤ bi−k , then
  (αj−k + · · · + αaj−k ) + (αi−k + · · · + αbi−k ) =
      (αj−k + · · · + αaj−k + αaj−k +1 + · · · + αbi−k ) + (αi−k + · · · + αaj−k )
                                                                              (4.2)
                                                  7
¿From eqs. 4.1 and 4.2, we can conclude that τ ′ (ωj−1 ) + φ(ωi ) = θ ′ (ωj−1 ) +
ψ ′ (ωi ). The rest follows by induction.
    • Case (3) ri = bi ≥ aj is similar to case (1).
    • Case (4) ri = aj > bi is similar to case (2).

  In fact, we have proved:
Lemma 4.2. Let j ≥ i, τ, θ ∈ Wj , φ, ψ ∈ Wi be such that τ (ωj ) + φ(ωi ) =
                        ˙ = τ ∪φ.
θ(ωj ) + ψ(ωi ). Then θ ∪ψ    ˙

                    5. Condition (1) of Theorem 2.5
Proposition 5.1. Let τ, φ ∈ W w be two non-comparable elements. Then
in the straightening relation 3.1, pτ ∨φ pτ ∧φ occurs with coefficient ±1.
Proof. As before, denote σ = τ ∨ φ, κ = τ ∧ φ. Note that τ, φ ≺w σ (that
is there exist liftings τ̃ , φ̃, σ̃ in W such that τ̃ , φ̃  σ̃  w). Corollary 3.2
implies that the restriction of eq. 3.1 to the Schubert variety S(σ̃) is pτ pφ =
apσ pκ , where a 6= 0. Since standard monomial basis is characteristic free,
this holds in any characteristics. Hence a = ±1.

   So now we have to prove that a = 1. Since the irreducible representation
V (ωi + ωj ), appears as a direct sum in the decomposition in V (ωj ) ⊗ V (ωi )
into irreducible representations, we have an imbedding V (ωi +ωj ) ֒→ V (ωj )⊗
V (ωi ). Note that since the weight space of weight ωi +ωj is one-dimensional,
the element vωj ⊗ vωi belongs to V (ωi + ωj ). The imbedding above induces
a projection H 0 (G/B, Lωi ) ⊗ H 0 (G/B, Lωj ) → H 0 (G/B, Lωi ⊗ Lωj ). For
simplicity we shall denote the image of f ⊗ g under this projection by f g.
We shall construct a basis for EZ,w (ωi + ωj ) which is a “rank two” version
of the one given in [9].
   In the following let i ≤ j (that is no element of Wiw can be bigger than
an element of Wjw ) and recall from lemma 2.1 that, for φ ∈ Wi , we have
denoted by Qφ an extremal weight vector in VZ (ωi ) of weight φ(ωi ).
   Let Σ(w) := {(τ, σ) ∈ Wjw × Wiw | there exist liftings τe, σ
                                                              e in W such that
σ
e  τe  w}.
Definition 5.2. Let w be as in Definition 1.1. Let κ ∈ Wiw , σ ∈ Wjw be
such that (σ, κ) ∈ Σ(w) and let σ = sir · · · si1 κ̆ where r = ℓ(σ)− ℓ(κ̆). Define
Eκ̆,κ := Qκ̆ ⊗ Qκ ∈ VZ (ωj ) ⊗ VZ (ωi ) and define Eσ,κ := X−αir · · · X−αi1 Eκ̆,κ .

  Note that Eκ̆,κ is an extremal weight vector since κ̆ is the image of κ (the
minimal representative in W ) in Wj . It is also clear that Eσ,κ is a weight
vector of weight κ(ωi ) + σ(ωj ).
Proposition 5.3. Let w ∈ W be as in definition 1.1. Then Eσ,κ does not
depend on the choice of reduced expression and the set {Eσ,κ | κ ∈ Wiw , σ ∈
Wjw , κ w σ} is a Z-basis for the Demazure module EZ,w (ωi + ωj ).
                                         8
Proof. Let σ = sir · · · si1 κ̆ = sjr · · · sj1 κ̆. Denote by φ = sjr−1 · · · sj1 κ̆. Then
we have σ = sjr φ. Now if ir = jr , then we proceed by induction on the
length of σ. Otherwise, let k be the largest integer such that jr = ik . We
have φ ∨ κ̆ = σ, thus by lemma 1.6, we have that sjr commute with sil for
l ≥ k. Thus
    X−αir · · · X−α1 Eκ̆,κ = X−αik X−αir · · · X−αik+1 X−αik−1 · · · X−αi1 Eκ̆,κ
By induction, Eφ,κ = X−αjr−1 · · · X−αj1 Eκ̆,κ . Therefore the right-hand side
is X−αjr Eφ,κ and we have proved that the definition of Eσ,κ does not depend
on the choice of the reduced expression.
   We are left to show that these elements form a basis for EZ,w (ωi + ωj ).
   We claim that Eσ,κ ∈ EZ,w (ωi + ωj ). It is clear that Eκ̆,κ ∈ EZ,κ (ωi + ωj ).
Now, since w satisfies the condition of definition 1.1, we have w  sir · · · si1 κ,
thus
           Eσ,κ ∈ X−αir · · · X−αi1 EZ,κ (ωi + ωj ) ⊂ EZ,w (ωi + ωj ).
We have therefore our claim.
   Now by the definition of Eσ,κ , we have
                                            X
                      Eσ,κ = Qσ ⊗ Qκ +           Qu ⊗ Qv
                                                (u,v)∈I

where I ⊂ Wj × Wi and for each (u, v) ∈ I, we have u ≺ σ in Wj , v ≻ κ in
Wi and σ(ωj ) + κ(ωi ) = u(ωj ) + v(ωi ). It is now clear that the Eσ,κ ’s are
independant.
   Further, one deduces from the expression for Eσ,κ above that the Z-
submodule generated by the Eσ,κ ’s is a direct summand of the tensor product
VZ (ωj )⊗VZ (ωi ). Finally, by standard monomial theory, the cardinal of Σ(w)
is the rank of EZ,w (ωi + ωj ). So the result follows.
  We can now prove that a = 1.
Corollary 5.4. Let the   notations be as in Lemma 1.5, then in the straight-
                        PN
ening relation pτ pφ = l=1 cl pθl pψl , the term pσ pκ occurs on the right hand
side with coefficient 1.
Proof. Recall from the proof of 5.3 that
                                                 X
                        Eσ,κ = Qσ ⊗ Qκ +                  Qu ⊗ Qv
                                                (u,v)∈I

where I ⊂ Wj × Wi and for each (u, v) ∈ I, we have u ≺ σ in Wj , v ≻ κ in
Wi and σ(ωj ) + κ(ωi ) = u(ωj ) + v(ωi ).
   Let us apply pτ pφ to Eσ,κ . Then from the explicite expression of Eσ,κ
above, this is either 0 or 1 depending if Qτ × Qφ appears in the right hand
side or not.
   On the other hand, if we replace pτ pφ by the right hand side of the
straightening relation, then it is clear from Theorem 3.1 that the same eval-
uation yields aσ,κ . But this is non zero from Proposition 5.1. So it must be
1.
                                            9
                                 6. Consequence
  As an immediate consequence, we have:
Theorem 6.1. Let w be as in definition 1.1. Then there exists a flat de-
formation whose special fiber is a toric variety and whose general fiber is
S(w).
Proof. By theorem 2.4, there exists a flat deformation whose general fiber
is S(w) and whose special fiber is a variety defined by a binomial ideal
associated to a distributive lattice. This latter is toric as shown in [3].

Remark 6.2. If we look closely at the proofs, then we realize that theo-
rem 2.4 can be replaced by the following.
  Suppose that W w admits a structure of distributive lattice such that
  1. the partial order corresponds to standardness, cf theorem 1.3;
  2. weights are preserved, cf lemma 1.5;
  3. lemma 1.6 is satisfied.
Then there exists a flat deformation whose special fiber is a toric variety and
whose general fiber is S(w).
   In particular, consider the bijection Θ of W defined by si 7→ sn+1−i
induced by the non trivial Dynkin diagram automorphism. This induces a
bijection between Wi and Wn+1−i which preverses the induced Bruhat order.
Now let w be as in Definition 1.1, then Θ induces a structure of distributive
lattice on W Θ(w) . It is easy to check that the same proof works. Thus we
have,
Theorem 6.3. Let w or Θ(w) be as in definition 1.1. Then there exists a
flat deformation whose special fiber is a toric variety and whose general fiber
is S(w).

Remark 6.4. As noticed in [2], we can extend our results to the following
elements. Let 0 ≤ k1 < k2 < · · · < kr+1 ≤ n + 1, and for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, let Si
be the subgroup of W generated by the reflections ski +1 , · · · ski+1 −1 .
   Now suppose that w = w1 · · · wr where wi ∈ Si . Then it is clear that wi
and wj commute if i 6= j and it follows easily that if each wi satisfies the
condition of theorem 6.3, i.e. either wi or Θ(wi ) is as in definition 1.1, then
the conclusion of the same theorem holds for w.
   For example, the element s1 s2 s5 s4 satisfies the above conditions.
   Our results apply to all the elements of W in the case of SL3 thus giving
a more general proof to [1]. However, in the case of SL4 , there are precisely
4 elements for which the condition of the theorem is not satisfied. Namely,
they are s1 s3 s2 , s2 s1 s3 , s2 s1 s3 s2 and s1 s2 s3 s2 s1 . The main problem in these
cases is that standardness is not transitive in all the obvious “orderings”.
