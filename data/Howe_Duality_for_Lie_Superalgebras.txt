                                                       gl(m|n). In the former case we find as well explicit formulas for the high-

                                                Howe duality is a way of relating representation theory of a pair of reductive Lie
                                             groups/algebras [H1, H2]. It has found many applications to invariant theory, real
                                             and complex reductive groups, p-adic groups and infinite-dimensional Lie algebras
                                             etc.
                                                As an example we consider one of the fundamental cases—the (gl(m), gl(n))
                                             Howe duality. The symmetric algebra S(Cm ⊗ Cn ) and the skew-symmetric al-
                                             gebra Λ(Cm ⊗ Cn ) admit remarkable multiplicity-free decompositions under the
                                             natural actions of gl(m) × gl(n). The highest weight vectors of gl(m) × gl(n)
                                             inside the symmetric algebra are given by products of certain determinants (see
                                             (2.2)) and form a free abelian semi-group while those inside the skew-symmetric
                                             algebra are given by Grassmann monomials, cf. [H2, KV, GW].
                                                Our present paper is devoted to the study of Howe duality for Lie superalgebras
                                             and its applications. It is by now a well established fact that one should put
                                             the Grassmann variables on the same footing as Cartesian variables and hence
                                             it is natural to consider the supersymmetric algebra, which is a mixed tensor
                                             of symmetric and skew-symmetric algebras. In this paper we give a complete

description of the Howe duality in a symmetric1 algebra under the action of a
dual pair of general linear Lie superalgebras and find explicit formulas for the
highest weight vectors inside our symmetric model. A dual pair consisting of a
general linear Lie superalgebra and a general linear Lie algebra was discussed in
[H1]. We also study in detail some other multiplicity-free actions of the general
linear Lie superalgebras as specified below.
   Our motivation is manifold. First, our work is motivated by an attempt to
unify the Howe duality in the symmetric and skew-symmetric models [H2] which
have many differences and similarities. Specialization of our results gives rise to
the Howe duality for general linear Lie algebras in both symmetric and skew-
symmetric models. Secondly, we are motivated by our study of the duality in the
infinite-dimensional setup (see the review [W] and references therein) and our
work in progress on its generalization to the superalgebra case. We realize that
we have to understand the finite-dimensional picture better first in order to have
a more complete description of the infinite-dimensional picture. Thirdly, there
exists a new type of Howe duality which is of pure superalgebra phenomenon
which is treated in [CW].
   Let us discuss the contents of the paper. The generalization of Schur duality
for the superspace was given by Sergeev [Se]. For lack of an analog in the super
setup of the criterion of multiplicity-free action in terms of the existence of a
dense open orbit of a Borel subgroup (cf. [V] and [H2]), we use Sergeev’s result
to derive the decomposition of the symmetric algebra S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) with respect
to the action of the sum of two general linear Lie superalgebras gl(p|q) × gl(m|n).
We see that a representation of gl(p|q) is paired with a representation of gl(m|n)
parameterized by the same Young diagram. On the other hand one can show
that our Howe duality for superalgebras implies Sergeev’s Schur duality as well.
We also obtain an explicit multiplicity-free decomposition of a skew-symmetric
algebra Λ(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) as gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-modules. In particular it follows
that gl(p|q) and gl(m|n) when acting on S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) and respectively on
Λ(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) are mutual (super)centralizers. A remarkable phenomenon is the
complete reducibility of the symmetric model under the action of the dual pair,
which is quite unusual for Lie superalgebras.
   In a purely combinatorial way, Brini, Palareti and Teolis [BPT] were indeed
the first to obtain an explicit decomposition of S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) under the action
of gl(p|q) × gl(m|n). In addition, their combinatorial approach exhibits explicit
bases parameterized by so-called left (or right) symmetrized bitableuax between
two “standard Young diagrams” (see [BPT] for definition). However, Brini et al
did not identify the highest weights for these gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-modules inside
S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ).

     In this paper we will freely suppress the term super. So in case when a superspace is
involved, the terms symmetric, commute etc. mean supersymmetric, supercommute etc unless
otherwise specified.

   We also obtain an explicit decomposition into irreducible gl(m|n)-modules
of the symmetric algebra S(S 2 Cm|n ) and respectively skew-symmetric algebra
Λ(S 2 Cm|n ) of the symmetric square of the natural representation of gl(m|n).
These results unifies and generalizes several classical results and they can be
proved in an analogous way as in the classical case [H2, GW].
   Associated to the Howe duality and the above gl(m|n)-module decompositions,
we obtain, by taking characters, various combinatorial identities involving the
so-called hook Schur functions. Being generalization of Schur functions, these
hook Schur functions have been studied in [BR]. The decompositions mentioned
above in turn provide the representation theoretic realization of the corresponding
combinatorial identities. For example, the (gl(m|n), gl(p|q))-duality gives rise
to a combinatorial identity for the hook Schur functions which generalizes the
Cauchy identity for Schur functions, cf. [H2]. Specializations and variations of
these combinatorial identities are well known and other proofs can be found in
Macdonald [M].
   However it is a much more difficult problem to find explicit formulas for the
highest weight vectors of gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-modules inside the symmetric algebra.
We first find formulas for the highest weight vectors in the case for q = 0 (and so
for n = 0 by symmetry). A main ingredient in the formulas for the highest weight
vectors is given by the determinant of a matrix which involves both Cartesian
variables xij ’s and Grassmann variables η i ’s of the form:
                               1                    
                                 x1 x21 · · · xr1
                               x12 x22 · · · xr2 
                                                    
                               ..     ..          . 
                               .       . · · · .. 
                               1                    
                              xm x2m · · · xrm  .
                               1
                                      η2 · · · ηr 
                                                     
                              η
                               .       ..         . 
                               ..       . · · · .. 
                                 η1 η2 · · · ηr
We remark that the rows involving Grassmann variables are the same but the
determinant is nonzero (one needs to overcome some psychological barriers). Note
that when m = r the Grassmann variables disappear and the above determinant
reduces to those mentioned earlier which occur in the formulas for highest weight
vectors in the symmetric algebra case of the classical Howe duality. When m = 0,
the Cartesian variables disappear and the above determinant is equal to (up to
a scalar multiple) a Grassmann monomial which shows up in the formulas for
highest weight vectors in the classical skew-symmetric algebra case.
  We show that the gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) highest weight vectors form an abelian
semigroup in the case when p = m. However in contrast to the Lie algebra case
this semigroup is not free in general. We find that the generators of the semigroup
are given by highest weight vectors associated to rectangular Young diagrams of
4                    SHUN-JEN CHENG AND WEIQIANG WANG

length not exceeding m + 1. This way we are able to find explicit formulas for all
highest weight vectors in the case when q = 0 (or m = 0), or p = m.
   In the general case the highest weight vectors no longer form a semigroup. We
find a nice way to overcome this difficulty by introducing some extra variables
which, roughly speaking, help us to reduce the general case to the case p = m.
Then we use a simple method to get rid of the extra variables to obtain the
genuine highest weight vectors we are looking for.
   In contrast to the Howe duality in the Lie algebra setup, it is difficult to
check directly the highest weight condition of the vectors we have obtained. We
use instead the multiplicity-free decomposition of the symmetric algebra to get
around this difficulty. As highest weight constraint we obtain interesting non-
trivial polynomial identities typically involving various minors of a matrix.
   We also find explicit formulas for the highest weight vectors appearing in the
gl(m|n)-module decomposition of S(S 2 Cm|n ). These highest weight vector for-
mulas, which constitute a mixture of determinants and Pfaffians, have somewhat
similar features as those found in the Howe duality for the general linear Lie
superalgebras.
   A formula for highest weight vectors in the decomposition of S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) as
gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) modules may also be obtained in principle using the combina-
torial approach of Brini et al [BPT], and in this way the highest weights for these
gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) modules can be identified. However this way one can neither
expect to obtain formulas as explicit as ours, nor can one see the semigroup struc-
ture of the set of the highest weight vectors which is the guiding principle for us
to find these vectors. It is also interesting to see whether our results concerning
the decomposition of S(S 2 Cm|n ) (and respectively Λ(S 2 Cm|n )) and the highest
weight vectors in these models may also be obtained with extra insights from the
combinatorial approach in [BPT] as well.
   The plan of the paper goes as follows. In Section 2 we review the classical dual
pairs of general linear Lie algebras and Schur duality. In Section 3 we present
various multiplicity-free actions for Lie superalgebras and obtain the correspond-
ing symmetric function identities. Section 4 is devoted to the construction of the
gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) highest weight vectors inside S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ). More precisely,
in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, and Section 4.3, we find explicit formulas of highest
weight vectors in the case q = 0, p = m, and the general case, respectively. Finally
in Section 5 we construct the gl(m|n) highest weight vectors inside S(S 2 Cm|n ).

   In this section we will review some classical multiplicity-free actions of the
general linear Lie algebra. We begin with the classical gl(m) × gl(n)-duality, cf.
Howe [H2].
   Let λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λl ) be a partition of the integer |λ| = λ1 + . . . + λl , where
λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λl > 0. The integer |λ| is called the size, l is called the length (denoted
by l(λ)), and λ1 is called the width of the partition λ. Let λ′ denote the Young
diagram obtained from λ by transposing. We will often denote λ1 by t and write
λ′ = (λ′1 , λ′2 , . . . , λ′t ). For example, the Young diagram

stands for the partition (5, 3, 2, 1) and its transpose is the partition (4, 3, 2, 1, 1).
   Given a partition λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λl ) satisfying l ≤ m, we may regard λ as a
highest weight of gl(m) by identifying λ with the m-tuple (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λl , 0, . . . , 0)
by adding m − l zeros to λ. We denote the irreducible finite-dimensional highest
weight module of gl(m) by Vmλ .
   Consider the natural action of the complex general linear Lie groups GL(m)
and GL(n) on the space Cm ⊗ Cn . If we identify Cm ⊗ Cn with Mmn , the space of
all m × n matrices, then the actions of GL(m) and GL(n) are given by left and
right multiplications:
                      (g1 , g2 )(T ) = (g1t )−1 T g2−1                                                 g1 ∈ GL(m), g2 ∈ GL(n), T ∈ Mmn .
The Lie algebras gl(m) and gl(n) act on Cm ⊗ Cn accordingly. Denoting by
S(Cm ⊗ Cn ) the symmetric tensor algebra of Cm ⊗ Cn with an induced action of
gl(m)×gl(n), we have the following multiplicity-free decomposition of S(Cm ⊗Cn )
as a gl(m) × gl(n)-module:
                                                                                                                 X

where the sum above is over Young diagrams λ of length not exceeding min(m, n).
   One can find an explicit formula for the gl(m) × gl(n) highest weight vectors
in this decomposition. Let us denote a basis of Cm by x1 , x2 , . . . , xm and a basis
of Cn by x1 , x2 , . . . , xn . Then the vectors xji := xi ⊗ xj , for i = 1, . . . , m and
j = 1, . . . , n form a basis for Cm ⊗ Cn so that we may identify S(Cm ⊗ Cn )
with C[x11 , . . . , xn1 , . . . , x1m , . . . , xnm ]. Using this identification the standard Borel
subalgebra of gl(m) is a sum of the Cartan subalgebra generated by

                                   n
                                   X            ∂
                                         xji        ,    1 ≤ i ≤ m,

and the nilpotent radical generated by

                                 n
                                 X               ∂

  Let ǫi for i = 1, . . . , m (respectively ǫ̃j for j = 1, . . . , n) be the fundamental
weights corresponding to the Cartan subalgebra of gl(m) (respectively gl(n))

That is, ∆r is the highest weight vector for Λr (Cm ) ⊗ Λr (Cn ) inside S(Cm ⊗ Cn ),
the tensor product of the r-th fundamental representations of gl(m) and gl(n).
  Let λ be a Young diagram as in (2.1) with length not exceeding min(m, n).
The set of highest weight vectors in S(C m ⊗ Cn ) form an abelian semigroup,
and the product ∆λ′1 ∆λ′2 · · · ∆λ′t is a highest weight vector for the irreducible
representation in S(C m ⊗ Cn ) corresponding to the Young diagram λ.
  On the other hand, the skew-symmetric algebra Λ(Cm ⊗ Cn ) admits an in-
duced gl(m) × gl(n) action. Following Howe [H2], we have the multiplicity-free
decomposition

where the summation runs over Young diagrams λ of length not exceeding m and
of width not exceeding n.
   Denote by ηij , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n the standard basis for Cm ⊗ Cn in
the consideration of skew-symmetric algebra. The highest weight vector for the
                              ′
gl(m) × gl(n)-module Vmλ ⊗ Vnλ inside Λ(Cm ⊗ Cn ) is given by
                    η11 η12 · · · η1λ1 η21 η22 · · · η2λ2 . . . ηl1 ηl2 · · · ηlλl
where l is the length of λ.
  Intimately related to the Howe duality is the Schur duality, which we review be-
low. Consider the standard representation of GL(m) on Cm . It induces an action
on the k-th tensor power ⊗k Cm . Now the symmetric group Sk in k letters acts
on ⊗k Cm in a natural way. These two actions commute and we may thus decom-
pose ⊗k Cm into a direct sum of irreducible GL(m) × Sk -module. Recalling that
the irreducible representations of symmetric group Sk admit parameterization by
Young diagrams of weight k, Schur duality states that

where the summation is over Young diagrams λ of size k and of length not ex-
ceeding m. Here Mkλ is the irreducible representation of Sk corresponding to the
Young diagram λ.

   Further well known examples of a multiplicity-free action of gl(m) that are
of interest to us are as follows: consider the action of gl(m) on the symmetric
square S 2 Cm and skew-symmetric square Λ2 Cm . We have an induced action
on their respective symmetric algebras S(S 2Cm ) and S(Λ2 Cm ). Explicitly, the
decomposition of these spaces as gl(m)-modules is as follows (cf. [H2], [GW]):
                                           X
(2.3)                         S(S 2 Cm ) ∼
                                         =     Vm2λ ,
                                              l(λ)≤m
                                                X
                                S(Λ2 Cm ) ∼
                                                                ′
(2.4)                                     =             Vm(2λ) .
                                              l(λ)≤ m
                                                    2

Explicit formulas for the highest weight vectors in either cases are well known
(cf. [H2]) and are given in Remark 5.1.
   One may also consider the decompositions of the skew-symmetric algebra of
S C and Λ2 Cm . In order to describe the highest weights that appear in these
  2 m

decompositions we need a few terminology. The Young diagram associated to the
partition λ = (k + 1, 1, , . . . , 1) of length k ≥ 1 is called a (k + 1, k)-hook. We will
sometimes also call this (k + 1, k)-hook a hook of shape (k + 1, k). Assuming that
k > l we may form a new Young diagram by “nesting” the (l+1, l)-hook inside the
(k+1, k)-hook. The resulting partition of length k is (k+1, l+2, 2, . . . , 2, 1, . . . , 1),
where 2 appears l − 1 times and 1 appears k − l − 1 times. Similarly a sequence
of hooks of shapes (k1 + 1, k1), . . . , (ks + 1, ks ) with ki > ki+1 for i = 1, . . . , s − 1
may be nested, and the resulting partition has length k1 . In consistency with the
terminology used we call the partition (k, 1, . . . , 1) of length k + 1 a hook of shape
(k, k+1) or a (k, k+1)-hook. Nesting of hooks of shapes (k1 , k1 +1), . . . , (ks , ks +1)
with ki > ki+1 for i = 1, . . . , s − 1 is done in an analogous fashion.
   Now we can state the following multiplicity-free decompositions of gl(m)-
modules (cf. [H2], [GW]):
                                                  X
(2.5)                                Λ(S 2 Cm ) ∼
                                                =     Vmλ ,
                                                   λ
                                                 X
(2.6)                              Λ(Λ2Cm ) ∼
                                            =           Vmµ ,
                                                   µ

where λ (respectively µ) is over all partitions with l(λ) ≤ m (respectively l(µ) ≤
m) such that λ (respectively µ) is obtained by nesting a sequence of (k + 1, k)-
hooks (respectively of (k, k + 1)-hooks).

        3. Multiplicity-free Actions of the general linear Lie
                              superalgebra
  Let Cm|n denote the superspace of superdimension m|n. Recall that this means
that Cm|n is a Z2 -graded space, where the even subspace has dimension m and the
odd subspace has dimension n. The space of linear maps from Cm|n to itself can be

regarded as the space of (m+n)×(m+n) matrices with an induced Z2 -gradation,
which gives it a natural structure as a Lie superalgebra, denoted by gl(m|n). We
have a triangular decomposition gl(m|n) = gl(m|n)−1 + gl(m|n)0 + gl(m|n)1 ,
where gl(m|n)±1 denote the set of upper and lower triangular matrices and
gl(m|n)0 denotes the set of diagonal matrices. Given an m + n tuple of complex
numbers (a1 , . . . , am ; b1 , . . . , bn ), we associate an irreducible gl(m|n)-module Vm|n
of highest weight (a1 , . . . , am ; b1 , . . . , bn ) (with respect to the standard Borel sub-
algebra gl(m|n)0 + gl(m|n)1 ). It is well known (cf. e.g. [K]) that the module Vm|n
is finite-dimensional if and only if (a1 , . . . , am ; b1 , . . . , bn ) satisfies the conditions
ai − ai+1 , bj − bj+1 ∈ Z+ , for all i = 1, . . . , m − 1 and j = 1, . . . , n − 1.
   Let Cp|q and Cm|n denote complex superspaces of superdimensions p|q and m|n,
respectively. We will now describe a duality between the Lie superalgebras gl(p|q)
and gl(m|n). Our starting point is Schur duality for Lie superalgebra gl(m|n).
   Schur duality for the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) was studied in [Se]. Below we
will recall the main result for the convenience of the reader. Let Cm|n denote
the standard gl(m|n)-module. We may, as in the classical case, consider the k-
th tensor power ⊗k Cm|n which admits a natural action of the Lie superalgebra
gl(m|n). On the other hand the symmetric group Sk acts naturally on ⊗k Cm|n
by permutations with appropriate signs (corresponding to the permutations of
odd elements in Cm|n ). It is easy to check that the actions of gl(m|n) and Sk
commute with each other, cf. Sergeev [Se] (also see Berele-Regev [BR] for a more
detailed study).
Theorem 3.1 (Sergeev). As a gl(m|n) × Sk -module we have
                                 X
                       ⊗k Cm|n ∼

                                     Vm|n ⊗ Mkλ ,
                                               λ

where λ is summed over Young diagrams of size k such that λm+1 ≤ n, Mkλ
                                                               λ
is the irreducible Sk -module parameterized by λ, and Vm|n       denotes the irreducible
gl(m|n)-module with highest weight (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λm ; hλ1 −mi, . . . , hλ′n −mi), where
                                                             ′

we denote hli = l for l ∈ Z+ and hli = 0, otherwise.
  The symmetric algebra S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) is by definition equal to the tensor
product of the symmetric algebra of the even part of Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n and the skew-
symmetric algebra of the odd part of Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n . It admits a natural gradation
                                     X
                  S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) =      S k (Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n )
                                             k≥0

by letting the degree of the basis elements of Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n be 1. The natural
actions of gl(p|q) on Cp|q and gl(m|n) on Cm|n induce commuting actions on the
k-th symmetric algebra S k (Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ). Indeed gl(p|q) and gl(m|n) are mutual
centralizers in gl(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ). We obtain the following theorem by an analogous
argument as in [H2].

well-known fact that Mkλ is a self-contragredient module.

Remark 3.1. 1. This theorem (except the explicit formula for the highest weights)
     was first obtained in Brini et al [BPT] in a combinatorial approach. It is
     also obtained independently recently by Sergeev.
  2. When n = q = 0, we recover the (gl(p), gl(m))-duality in the symmetric
     algebra case. When q = m = 0 we recover the (gl(p), gl(n))-duality in the
     skew-symmetric algebra case.
  3. One can easily show that the (gl(m|n), gl(k))-duality implies the (gl(m|n), Sk )
     Schur duality (Theorem 3.1), using an argument of Howe (cf. 2.4, [H2]).
     The next corollary is immediate from Theorem 3.2.
Corollary 3.1. The image of the action of the universal enveloping algebras of
gl(p|q) and gl(m|n) on S k (Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) are double commutants.

n. Here the highest weight of the module Vp|q                        (respectively Vm|n     ) is given by
(λ1 , . . . , λp ; hλ′1 − pi, . . . , hλ′q − pi) (resp. (λ′1 , . . . , λ′m ; hλ1 − mi, . . . , hλn − mi)).

                 Λk (Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) ∼

                                  λ

where λ in the previous line is summed over all Young diagrams satisfying the
conditions λp+1 ≤ q and λ′m+1 ≤ n. The second to last equality follows from the
following well known facts: Mkλ is a self-contragredient module and tensoring the
                                                           ′
module Mkλ with the sign character yields the module Mkλ .

Remark 3.2. Of course it follows from Theorem 3.3 that the image of the action
of the universal enveloping algebras of gl(p|q) and gl(m|n) on Λk (Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) are
also double commutants.
  The following corollary turns out to be very useful later on in order to check
that a given vector is indeed a highest weight vector inside S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ).
Corollary 3.2. Assume a vector v ∈ S(Cp|q ⊗Cm|n ) has the weight λ with respect
to gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) associated to a Young diagram λ satisfying λp+1 ≤ q and
12                   SHUN-JEN CHENG AND WEIQIANG WANG

λm+1 ≤ n. If v is a highest weight vector for gl(p|q), then it is for gl(m|n) as
well.
Proof. Since v is a highest weight vector for gl(p|q) with weight λ, it belongs
to the subspace W of S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) which consists of vectors with weight λ
annihilated by the standard Borel in gl(p|q). By Theorem 3.2, W is isomorphic
    λ
to Vm|n as a gl(m|n)-module. There exists a unique vector (up to scalar multiple)
    λ
in Vm|n which has weight λ, which is the highest weight vector. By assumption v
has weight λ as a gl(m|n)-module, so it is a highest weight vector for gl(m|n).
   The description of highest weight vectors of the irreducible gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-
modules in the symmetric algebra turns out to be much more subtle than in the
classical Howe duality case and we will deal with this question in Section 4.
   Next consider the symmetric square S 2 Cm|n of the natural representation of
gl(m|n). The following theorem can be proved by an analogous argument as in
[H2]. This result was also obtained independently recently by Sergeev. We omit
the proof since it is in any case parallel to the proof of Theorem 3.5 below.
Theorem 3.4. The symmetric algebra of the symmetric square of the natural
representation Cm|n of the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) is a completely reducible
multiplicity-free gl(m|n)-module. More precisely we have the following decom-
position
                                              X
                            S k (S 2 Cm|n ) =    λ
                                                Vm|n ,
                                             λ
where the summation is over all partitions λ into even parts of size 2k and λm+1 ≤
n.
   Now S 2 Cm|n reduces to S 2 Cm in the case when n = 0, and to Λ2 Cn in the
case when m = 0, the symmetric and skew-symmetric square of the natural rep-
resentation of gl(m) and gl(n), respectively. Thus one obtains as a corollary the
classical multiplicity-free decompositions of their respective symmetric algebras,
namely (2.3) and (2.4). Again the question of obtaining explicit formulas for the
highest weight vectors inside S(S 2 Cm|n ) is substantially more subtle than in the
non-super case. We will give these in Section 5.
Theorem 3.5. The skew-symmetric algebra of the symmetric square of the nat-
ural representation Cm|n of the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) is a completely reducible
multiplicity-free gl(m|n)-module. More precisely we have the following decompo-

                                                Vm|n ,
                                             λ
where the summation is over all partitions λ of size 2k, which are obtained by
nesting (l + 1, l)-hooks with λm+1 ≤ n.

Proof. Our argument follows closely the one given in the proof of Theorem 4.4.2 in
[H2] with Theorem 3.1 replacing the classical Schur duality. Let Dk denote the the
subgroup of S2k , which preserves the partition {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, . . . , {2k − 1, 2k}}
of 2k. Note that Dk is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Sk and (Z2 )k , where
Z2 acts by interchanging 2j − 1 with 2j and Sk acts by permuting the pairs. Let
sign ∼ denote the character on Dk which is trivial on (Z2 )k , but transforms by
the sign character on Sk . We observe that
                                                  2k
                                                  O
                           Λ2k (S 2 Cm|n ) ∼

Thus using Theorem 3.1 we obtain
                         X                        X
       Λ2k (S 2 Cm|n ) ∼
                       =     λ
                           (Vm|n    λ Dk ,sign∼ ∼
                                 ⊗ M2k )        =    λ
                                                    Vm|n     λ Dk ,sign∼
                                                         ⊗ (M2k )        .

                                           λ Dk ,sign∼
Now by Theorem A1.4 of [H2] the space (M2k   )          is non-zero if and only if
λ is constructed from nesting hooks of types (l + 1, l), in which case it is one-
dimensional.
  Similarly we obtain as a corollary the classical multiplicity-free decompositions
(2.5) and (2.6).
                                        λ
Remark 3.3. The character of Vm|n           is defined as the trace of the action of the
                                                                          λ
diagonal matrix diag(x1 , . . . , xm ; y1, . . . , yn ) in gl(m|n) on Vm|n     and according to
[BR] is given by so-called hook Schur functions HSλ (x, y) (see [BR] for definition).
Thus, comparing the characters of both sides of Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3,
respectively, with x = (x1 , . . . , xp ), y = (y1 , . . . , yq ), u = (u1 , . . . , um) and v =
(v1 , . . . , vn ) we obtain the following combinatorial identities:
     X                              Y
            HSλ (x, y)HSλ (u, v) =      (1 − xi uk )−1 (1 − yj vl )−1 (1 + xi vl )(1 + yj uk ),

where 1 ≤ i ≤ p, 1 ≤ j ≤ q, 1 ≤ k ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ n with summation in the
first identity over λ such that λp+1 ≤ q and λm+1 ≤ n and in the second one over
λ such that λp+1 ≤ q and λ′m+1 ≤ n. Now putting y = v = 0 in the first identity
we obtain the classical Cauchy identity, while putting respectively y = u = 0 the
dual Cauchy identity (see e.g. [M]):

Remark 3.4. Similarly Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.5 give rise to the following
combinatorial identities (x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) and y = (y1 , . . . , yn )):
        X                   Y                                      Y

where in the first identity the sum is over all partitions λ with even rows such that
λm+1 ≤ n and in the second over all partitions µ that can be obtained by nesting
(k + 1, k)-hooks such that µm+1 ≤ n and 1 ≤ i, i′ ≤ m, 1 ≤ j, j ′ ≤ n. Putting
either x = 0 or y = 0 in these two identities we obtain the following classical

     4. Construction of highest weight vectors in S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n )
     This section is devoted to the construction of the highest weight vectors of
gl(p|q) × gl(m|n) inside the symmetric algebra of Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n . We will divide this
section into several cases. Before we embark on this task we will set the notation
to be used throughout this section.
     We let e1 , . . . , ep ; f 1, . . . , f q denote the standard homogeneous basis for the
standard gl(p|q)-module. Here ei are even, while f j are odd basis elements.
Similarly we let e1 , . . . , em ; f1 , . . . , fn denote the standard homogeneous basis for
the standard gl(m|n)-module. The weights of ei , f j , el and fk are denoted by ǫ̃i ,
δ̃j , ǫl and δk , for 1 ≤ i ≤ p, 1 ≤ j ≤ q, 1 ≤ l ≤ m and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, respectively.
We set
(4.1)          xil := el ⊗ ei ; ξlj := el ⊗ f j ; ηki := fk ⊗ ei ; ykj := fk ⊗ f j .

We will denote by C[x, ξ, η, y] the polynomial superalgebra generated by (4.1).
The commuting pair of gl(p|q) and gl(m|n) may be realized as first order differ-
ential operators as follows (1 ≤ i, i′ ≤ p; 1 ≤ l, l′ ≤ q and 1 ≤ s, s′ ≤ m; 1 ≤

With these conventions, we may thus identify S(Cp|q ⊗ Cm|n ) with the polynomial
superalgebra C[x, ξ, η, y] (as gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-modules).
4.1. Highest Weight Vectors: the Case q = 0. In this section we will describe
the highest weight vectors for gl(p) × gl(m|n) in the symmetric algebra S(Cp ⊗
Cm|n ), i.e. q = 0 case. The space S(Cp ⊗ Cm|n ) is identified with C[x, η], and
(4.4) and (4.5) reduce to

respectively. Now by Theorem 3.2 a highest weight representation Vpλ ⊗ Vm|n        λ
                                                                                      of
gl(p) × gl(m|n) appears in the decomposition of S k (Cp ⊗ Cm|n ) if and only if λ is
of size k and of length at most p such that λm+1 ≤ n.
   We will consider two cases separately, namely m ≥ p and m < p.
   We begin with the case of m ≥ p. Here the condition λm+1 ≤ n is an empty
condition. So we are looking for homogeneous polynomials of degree k in C[x, η],
annihilated by all vectors of (4.6) and (4.7), and having gl(p)- and gl(m|n)-weight
λ of length not exceeding p. If λ is such a weight, then λ′i ≤ p, where we recall that
λ′ = (λ′1 , . . . , λ′t ) denotes the transpose of λ. It is easy to see that the product
∆λ′1 · · · ∆λ′t is annihilated by all vectors of (4.6) and (4.7), where we recall that
∆r is defined in (2.2). It is straightforward to check that its weight is exactly λ.
Theorem 4.1. In the case when m ≥ p, all gl(p)×gl(m|n) highest weight vectors
in C[x, η] form an abelian semigroup generated by ∆r , for r = 1, . . . , p. The
highest weight vector associated to the weight λ is given by the product ∆λ′1 · · · ∆λ′t .
   We now consider the case p > m. In this case the condition λm+1 ≤ n is no
longer an empty condition. Obviously the highest weight vectors associated to
Young diagrams λ with λm+1 = 0 can be obtained just as in the previous case.
   Now suppose λ is a diagram of length exceeding m. Let λ′1 , λ′2 , . . . , λ′t denote
its column lengths as usual. We have p ≥ λ′1 ≥ λ′2 . . . ≥ λ′t and m ≥ λ′n+1 . For
m ≤ r ≤ p, the following determinant of an r × r matrix plays a fundamental
role in this paper:

That is, the first m rows are filled by the vectors (x1j , . . . , xrj ), for j = 1, . . . , m,
in increasing order and the last r − m rows are filled with the same vector
(ηk1 , . . . , ηkr ). Since the matrix entries involve Grassmann variables ηki , we must
specify what we mean by the determinant. By the determinant of a matrix

expression σ∈Sr (−1)p(σ) a1 a2 · · · ar , where p(σ) is the length of σ in the
symmetric group Sr . In general it is not true that detA = detAt .
Remark 4.1. The determinant (4.8) is always nonzero. It reduces to (2.2) when
m = r, and reduces to (up to a scalar multiple) ηk1 · · · ηkr when m = 0.
  Now let λ be a diagram of length at most p such that λm+1 ≤ n. It is thus of
the following shape:

Now the second diagram in (4.9) has length not exceeding m, so its associ-
ated highest weight vector is given by the product ∆λ′r+1 · · · ∆λ′t . A formula
for the highest weight vector associated to the first diagram in (4.9) is given by

Proposition 4.1. Let p ≥ λ′1 ≥ λ′2 ≥ . . . ≥ λ′r > m. Then rk=1 ∆k,λ′k is a
highest weight vector associated to the first Young diagram in (4.9).

Proof. Observe that rk=1 ∆k,λ′k has the same gl(p) × gl(m|n)-weight as the first

Young diagram of (4.9). Clearly rk=1 ∆k,λ′k is non-zero. It is straightforward to
            Q
verify that rk=1 ∆k,λ′k is annihilated by the operators in (4.6). It follows from
                   Q
Corollary 3.2 that rk=1 ∆k,λ′k is also a highest weight vector for gl(m|n).
  Our next theorem follows by observing that the product of the highest weight
vectors corresponding to the two Young diagrams in (4.9) is non-zero and is a
highest weight vector associated to the Young diagram λ.
Theorem 4.2. Suppose that m < p. An irreducible highest weight module Vpλ ⊗

of length not exceeding p and λm+1 ≤ n. Furthermore a highest weight vector
associated to such a λ is given by

where r is defined by   λ′r   > m and    λ′r+1   ≤ m.
  As a corollary we obtain the following useful combinatorial identity, which will
play an important role later on.

Proof. Consider ∆1,p and ∆2,q where p ≥ q. By Theorem 4.2 the product ∆1,p ∆2,q
is a highest weight vector and thus
                                Pp is annihilated   by all operators in (4.7). In

                                           2
we obtain the desired identity.

Remark 4.2. The above corollary gives rise to identities involving minors in even
variables x’s by looking at the coefficient of a fixed Grassmann monomial involving
η’s. We do not know of other direct proof of these identities.

   It is well known (cf. [OV]) that as a gl(p)-module S i (Cp ) ⊗ Λj (Cp ), for j =
1, . . . , p, decomposes
                 P       into a direct   P sum two irreducible components of highest
weights iǫ1 + jk=1 ǫk and iǫ1 + j+1          k=2 ǫk , respectively. We can also get this result
from Theorem 4.2 and in addition obtain explicit formulas                 P of the highest weight
vectors. To do so consider S k (Cp ⊗C1|1 ) ∼         = S k (Cp|p) ∼  = i+j=k S i (Cp|0)⊗Λj (C0|p ).
Now according to Theorem 4.2 all the gl(p) ×gl(1|1) highest weight vectors inside
S k (Cp ⊗ C1|1 ) are given by (x11 )i ∆1,j , where j = 1, . . . , p and i + j = k. These
vectors are of course gl(p) highest weight vectors. Now a simple calculation
shows that applying the negative root vector of gl(1|1) to (x11 )i ∆1,j we obtain a
non-zero multiple of (x11 )i η11 η12 . . . η1j , while applying the negative root vector again
gives zero. Thus the vectors (x11P      )i ∆1,j and (x11 )i η11 η12 . . . η1j exhaust all gl(p) highest
weight vectors inside the space i+j=k S i (Cp )⊗Λj (Cp ). To conclude the proof we
observe that the vectors (x11 )i−1 ∆1,j+1 and (x11 )i η11 η12 . . . η1j lie in S i (Cp ) ⊗ Λj (Cp ),
                     P                            P
with weights iǫ1 + jk=1 ǫk and iǫ1 + j+1             k=2 ǫk , respectively.




4.2. Highest Weight Vectors: the Case p = m. In this section we shall
find gl(m|q) × gl(m|n) highest weight vectors that appear in the decomposition
of C[x, ξ, η, y]. By Theorem 3.2 we need to construct a vector in C[x, ξ, η, y]
annihilated by all operators in (4.4) and (4.5) of weight corresponding to the
Young diagram λ

where r ≤ min(q, n) (which we will always assume for this section).
  First we remark that if λ has length less than or equal to m then it is easy
to check that a formula for the corresponding highest weight vector is given by
∆λ′1 · · · ∆λ′t . So we may assume that the length of λ exceeds m.

   Denoting the second diagram by µ and v a highest weight vector associated
to the first diagram, it is easy to see that the product v∆µ′1 · · · ∆µ′t−r is a highest
weight vector for the diagram λ. Thus our task reduces to finding a highest
weight vector associated to the first diagram in (4.11).
   We claim that a highest weight vector associated to the first diagram in (4.11)
can be essentially obtained by taking a product of those associated to s diagrams
of rectangular shape

Similarly by taking a product of s such vectors associated to the s diagrams of the
                                                                             λm+2 +...+λm+s
form (4.12) of widths λm+1 , . . . , λm+s , respectively, and dividing by ∆m
we obtain a highest weight vector associated to the first diagram of (4.11). So our
task now is to find a formula for a highest weight vector corresponding to a Young
diagram of shape (4.12). (From the explicit formula it will follow immediately
that a product of s vectors of such type is non-zero).
   Let us put r = λm+i in (4.12). We define the r × r matrix Y and the m × m
matrix X as follows:
                       1 2                             1                   

  Given a Young diagram λ of rectangular shape (see (4.12)) consisting of m rows
and r columns, we consider marked diagrams D obtained by marking the boxes
in λ subject to the restriction that each column can contain no more than one
marked box. For example the following is a marked diagram in the case r = 6
and m = 4:
                                                                          1                                     2                                    3                                     4

To each such a marked diagram D we may associate an r × r matrix YD obtained
from Y as follows. For each marked box, say in the i-th column and j-th row, we
replace the i-th row of the matrix Y by the vector (ξj1 , ξj2 , . . . , ξjr ). The resulting
matrix will be denoted by YD . For instance in our example (4.14) the matrix YD
22                       SHUN-JEN CHENG AND WEIQIANG WANG

is

To each such diagram D we may also associate r m×m matrices Xi (i = 1, . . . , r)
obtained from X as follows. If the i-th column of D is not marked, then Xi = X.
If the i-th column is marked at the j-th row, then Xi is the matrix obtained from
X by replacing its j-th row by the vector (ηi1 , ηi2 , . . . , ηim ). As an illustration, the
diagram in our example (4.14) gives rise to the matrices

     Let |D| denote the total number of marked boxes in the diagram D. Set

                                       ∆D := detXD detYD ,
                           Q
where by detXD we mean ri=1 detXi arranged in increasing order. We can now
state the following theorem.
                             P         1
Theorem 4.3. The vector D (−1) 2 |D|(|D|−1)∆D is a gl(m|q) × gl(m|n) highest
weight vector in C[x, ξ, η, y] corresponding to the rectangular Young diagram of
length m + 1 and width r, where the summation over D ranges over all possible
marked m × r diagrams.
                               P          1
Proof. We first show that D (−1) 2 |D|(|D|−1)∆D indeed has the correct weight.
   First note that diagram (4.12) corresponds to the gl(m|q) × gl(m|n)-weight
Pm           Pm             Pr          Pr
   i=1 rǫi +     i=1 rǫ̃i +  j=1 δj +      j=1 δ̃j . Let D̃i , j = 1, . . . , m, denote the m
disjoint subsets of {1, . . . , r} defined by the condition that j ∈ D̃i if and only if
D contains a marked box at its j-th column and i-th row. Put D̃ = ∪m                       D̃ and
  c
                                                         P             Pm                Pri
                                                                                       i=1
D̃ = {1, . . . , r} − D̃. The weight of detYD is j∈D̃c δj + i=1 |D̃i |ǫi + j=1 δ̃j .
                             P            Pm               P              Pm
Now detXD has weight r m         i=1 ǫi −   i=1 |D̃i |ǫi +    j∈D̃ δj + r       ǫ̃i . Hence each
                             Pm            Pm            Pr           Pr i=1
detYD detXD has weight i=1 rǫi + i=1 rǫ̃i + j=1 δj + j=1 δ̃j , as required.

                   s,s−1∈D̃
            = 0.
This is because if s, s − 1 ∈ D̃i , for some i, then the term

                           = · · · detXs−1 (i)detXs−1 (i) · · ·
                           = 0,
where in general Xb (a) is the matrix obtained from X by replacing the a-th row
with the vector (ηb1 , . . . , ηbm ).
  Now if s ∈ D̃i and s − 1 ∈ D̃l , then
        m                   q
                                           !

           ηs−1    j +         ys−1      j   (detXD ) = · · · detXs−1 (l)detXs−1 (i) · · · .
       j=1
                ∂η s      j=1
                                      ∂y s

Let D ′ be the same diagram as D, except s ∈ D̃ ′ l and s − 1 ∈ D̃ ′ i . Then we have
        m               q
                                     !

       j=1
                ∂η s   j=1
                                ∂y s

Of course YD = YD′ and detXs−1(i) anticommutes with detXs−1(l), so
          m               q
                                       !

                                  ∂y s

Next we observe that if D is a diagram such that s, s − 1 6∈ D̃ then
                 m               q
                                              !
                X    j    ∂     X    j    ∂
                    ηs−1    j +     ys−1    j   (detXD detYD ) = 0,

                                         ∂y s

   We will denote the vector D (−1) 2 |D|(|D|−1)∆D by Γr . It is clear that a product
of Γr ’s (not necessary for the same value r) remains nonzero. Thus a highest
weight vector for an arbitrary Young diagram of shape (4.10) can be constructed
using such vectors, as described earlier in this section. We summarize the results
in this section in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.4. An irreducible representation Vm|q      ⊗ Vm|n  of gl(m|q) × gl(m|n)
appears in the decomposition of C[x, ξ, η, y] if and only if λ is associated to a
Young diagram with λm+1 ≤ min(q, n). Let t be the length of λ′ . Then
 (1) if the length of λ does not exceed m, then a highest weight vector is given by
     ∆λ′1 · · · ∆λ′t .
 (2) if the length of λ is m + s, s ≥ 1, let 0 ≤ r ≤ min(q, n) be such that λ′r > m
     and λ′r+1 ≤ m, then a highest weight vector corresponding to λ is given by

(4.22)                            (∆m )−(λm+2 +...+λm+s ) Γλm+1 Γλm+2 · · · Γλm+s ∆λ′r+1 · · · ∆λ′t .
      We will obtain a more explicit formula for (4.22) in the next section.
4.3. Highest Weight Vectors: the General Case. We consider now the
general case. Without loss of generality we may assume p ≥ m.
                                                                                                                                                                                                           λ    λ
   According to Theorem 3.2 an irreducible gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-module Vp|q                                                                                                                                     ⊗ Vm|n
appears in the decomposition of C[x, ξ, η, y] if and only if λm+1 ≤ n and λp+1 ≤ q.
If the length of the Young diagram λ is less than or equal to m, then ∆λ′1 · · · ∆λ′t
is the desired highest weight vector, where t is the length of λ′ . If the length of
λ exceeds m, but is less than or equal to p, then we see that the vector given in
Theorem 4.2 provides a formula for the highest weight vector in this case as well.
Thus it remains to study the case when the length of λ exceeds p.
   So we are to consider a Young diagram of the form:

We associate the vectors ∆r+1,λ′r+1 · · · ∆r′ ,λ′r′ and ∆λ′r′ +1 · · · ∆λ′t to the second and
third diagrams in (4.24) respectively. Below we will construct a highest weight
vector for the first diagram in (4.24). From the formula it will be easy to see
that the product of these three vectors is a highest weight vector for the Young
diagram (4.23).
  The above discussion thus reduces our question to finding a gl(p|q) × gl(m|n)-
highest weight vector corresponding to a Young diagram of type:

where r ≤ min(q, n). The difficulty of finding a highest weight vector associated
to such a diagram lies in the fact that the highest weight vectors in C[x, ξ, η, y]
no longer form a semigroup in general.
   We will now outline our strategy. We need to find highest weight vectors in
C[x, ξ, η, y], annihilated by (4.5) and having weight corresponding to the Young
diagram in (4.25). Recall that x denotes the set of even variables {xil |1 ≤ i ≤
p, 1 ≤ l ≤ m}. We introduce a new set of even variables xil , 1 ≤ i ≤ p, m < l ≤ p,
and denote by x′ = {xil |1 ≤ i, l ≤ p}, the union of our old set with this new
set. We shall construct certain vectors in C[x′ , ξ, η, y], which can been shown,

priori these vectors lie in C[x′ , ξ, η, y] so that such vectors do not make sense.
However, we will show that these vectors, after dividing by a suitable power of
the determinant of the p × p matrix (xil ), are in fact independent of the variables
{xil |1 ≤ i ≤ p, m + 1 ≤ l ≤ p}, and thus lie in C[x, ξ, η, y].
  Consider a marked diagram having m rows and r columns with at most r
marked boxes subject to the constraint that at most one marked box appears on
each column. To such a diagram D we have associated in the previous section a
matrix YD , which is obtained from the r × r matrix Y (see (4.13)) by suitably
replacing its rows. To each such diagram we now associate p × p matrices Xi , for
1 ≤ i ≤ r, similar to the ones in the previous section: Let X denote the p × p
matrix:

If the i-th column of D is not marked, then Xi = X. If the i-th column is marked
at the j-th row, then Xi is the matrix obtained from X by replacing its j-th
row by the vector (ηi1 , ηi2 , . . . , ηip ). Note thatQnone of its m + 1-st to p-th rows
are replaced. As before we define detXD := ri=1 detXi (arranged in increasing
                         P               1
order) and define Γr = D (−1) 2 |D|(D|−1) detXD detYD .
   The proof of Theorem 4.3 carries over word for word to prove
Proposition 4.2. The vector Γr is annihilated by (4.5).
   In the case when p = m a highest weight vector for the first Young diagram in
(4.11) is obtained essentially by taking product of highest weight vectors for the
Young diagram of type (4.12). In the case when p > m one can verify that this
procedure cannot be carried out, as such products are necessarily zero. Hence
in this case we will need to find a general formula for the Young diagram λ of
shape (4.25). To do so we will first consider matrices that will play the same role
in the case of p ≥ m as the Xi ’s play in the case p = m. As we will generalize
diagrams to include those that allow more than one marked box on each column,
we are led to study combinatorial identities of determinants of matrices obtained
from X that have more than one row replaced by an odd vector. This leads us
to define the following types of determinants.
   Let X be the p×p matrix as in (4.26) and let (ηj1 , . . . , ηjp ) be an odd vector. Let
I be a subset of {1, . . . , p} and define Xj (I) to be the matrix obtained from X by
replacing its i-th row by the vector (ηj1 , . . . , ηjp ), for all i ∈ I. If I = {i1 , . . . , il },
we write Xj (I) = Xj (i1 , . . . , il ) as well.

Lemma 4.1. We have
                                                      1
(4.27)        detX1 (1)detX1 (2) · · · detX1 (p) =       (detX)p−1 detX1 (1, . . . , p).
                                                      p!
Proof. Denoting by R(X) and L(X) the right-hand side and the left-hand side of
(4.27), respectively, we may regard R and L as functions of X. Since the group
GL(p) acts on X, the space of p × p matrices, by left multiplication, it acts on
functions of X. To be more precise if A ∈ GL(p), then (A · L)(X) := L(A−1 X)
and (A · R)(X) := R(A−1 X). We want to study the effect of this action on R and
L. In order to do so, consider first the action of the three kinds of elementary
matrices on them. Namely, those that interchanges any two rows, that multiplies
a row by a scalar, and those that add a scalar multiple of a row to another. It is
subject to a direct verification that if A is any of the three types of elementary
matrices, we have
(4.28)        (A · R)(X) = (detA)1−p R(X),           (A · L)(X) = (detA)1−p L(X).
Since every element in GL(p) is a product of elementary matrices, we conclude
that (4.28) holds for every A ∈ GL(p) as well. Putting X = 1p , the identity
p × p matrix, we see that R(1p ) = L(1p ) so that R(A) = L(A) by (4.28) for all
A ∈ GL(p). As GL(p) is a Zariski open set in the space of p × p matrices we have
R(X) = L(X) for any p × p matrix X.

Remark 4.3. An alternative proof of the above lemma can be given as follows.
Let Xij denote the (i, j)-th minor of X. It is known that det(Xij ) = detX p−1
which follows directly from a form of the Cramer’s formula X(Xij ) = (detX)1p .
The above lemma follows from this identity by expanding each determinant in the
left-hand side of (4.27) by the row (η11 , . . . , η1p ) and noting that detX1 (1, . . . , p)
is equal to p! η11 η12 · · · η1p .

Corollary 4.2. Let I = {i1 , . . . , i|I| } and J = {j1 , . . . , j|J| } be two subsets of
{1, . . . , p} arranged in increasing order. Then
  (i) detX1 (I)detX1 (J) = 0 if and only if I ∩ J 6= ∅.
                                                    1
 (ii) detX1 (i1 )detX1 (i2 ) · · · detX1 (i|I| ) = |I|! (detX)|I|−1detX1 (I).
(iii) For I ∩ J = ∅ we have
                                              |I|!|J|!
               detX1 (I)detX1 (J) = ǫIJ                  detXdetX1 (I ∪ J),
                                            (|I| + |J|)!
     where ǫIJ is the sign of the permutation that arranges the ordered tuple
     (i1 , . . . , i|I| , j1 , . . . , j|J| ) in increasing order.
Proof. (i) is an obvious consequence of Lemma 4.1.

  For (ii) let I c = {k1 , . . . , k|I c | } denote the complementary subset of I in
{1, . . . , p} put in increasing order. We apply successively the differential op-

                      1                1                        1




                                                            1
           (detX)p−|I| detX1 (i1 ) · · · detX1 (i|I| ) =        (detX)p−1 detX1 (I).
                                                           |I|!



Dividing by (detX)p−|I| we obtain (ii).
  By (ii) we have



       1                1
           (detX)|I|−1      (detX)|J|−1detX1 (I)detX1 (J) =
      |I|!             |J|!
                                detX1 (i1 ) · · · detX1 (i|I| )detX1 (j1 ) · · · detX1 (j|J| ).



Thus if ǫIJ is the permutation arranging I ∪ J in increasing order, then



   1                                              ǫIJ
         (detX)|I|+|J|−2detX1 (I)detX1 (J) =              (detX)|I|+|J|−1detX1 (I∪J).
|I|!|J|!                                     (|I| + |J|)!



Now (iii) follows from dividing the above equation by (detX)|I|+|J|−2 and multi-
plying by |I|!|J|!.




  Returning to the problem of finding the highest weight vector associated to the
Young diagram (4.25), our first task is to present a more explicit expression for
a product of the form Γλp+1 · · · Γλp+s . We associate to such a Young diagram a
collection D of s marked diagrams Di , i = 1, . . . , s, with Di having λp+i columns

Marked boxes are put into D subject to the following constraint: in each Di a
column has at most one marked box. If a diagram Di contains a marked box in
its k-th row and s-th column, then no other Dj (j 6= i) contains a marked box
in its k-th row and s-th column. From now on D will denote such a collection of
marked diagrams.
   Now suppose that D is a collection of diagrams Di , i = 1, . . . , s. To each Di
we may associate a λp+i × λp+i matrix YDi as in the previous section. We let
detYD := detYD1 detYD2 · · · detYDs . Now to each column j of D (1 ≤ j ≤ λp+1),
we may associate a p × p matrix Xj (Ij ) obtained from the matrix X as follows.
Let Ij be the subset of {1, . . . , p} consisting of the numbers of the marked rows on
the column j. We define Xj (Ij ) to be the matrix obtained from X by replacing
the rows of X corresponding to Ij by the vector (ηj1 , . . . , ηjp ). We then define
XD := X1 (I1 )X2 (I2 ) . . . Xλp+1 (Iλp+1 ).
   Suppose we have a marked box in Di appearing in its k-th row and s-th column.
We associate an odd indeterminate aks                                         ks
                                             i . Consider the product of all ai arranged
in increasing order following the lexicographical ordering of (i, s, k). Now we may
also consider the product arranged in increasing order following the lexicographi-
cal ordering (s, k, i). These two products differ by a sign, and this sign is denoted
32                              SHUN-JEN CHENG AND WEIQIANG WANG

by ǫD . Furthermore we let di = |Di |, the number of marked boxes in Di , and ej
be the number of marked boxes in the j-th column of D.

Proof. Given diagram Di with m rows and λp+i columns, for i = 1, . . . , s, we
want to know how to simplify the expression
                                1   Ps
                                            di (di −1)
                    (−1) 2           i=1                  detXD1 detYD1 · · · detXDs detYDs .
We move all detXDi to the left and get
                        1   Ps
                                        di dj )− 21 |D|

Now each detXDi is a product of detXb (a). We arrange all X1 (a) together so that
X1 (a1 ) appears to the left of X1 (a2 ) if and only if a1 < a2 and call the resulting
              η1
expression XD    and move it to the left. We do the same thing to X2 (a) and move
  η2                   η1
XD   to the right of XD   etc. Then (4.30) becomes
                            1   Ps
                                            di dj )− 21 |D|       η1 η2         ηλ

We apply now Corollary 4.2 to (4.31) and obtain

Since si=1 λp+i = i=1               (λi − p), the proposition follows.
     It follows immediately from Corollary 4.1 that
Proposition 4.4. The vector
      Z := detX1 (m + 1, . . . , p) detX2 (m + 1, . . . , p) · · · detXλp+1 (m + 1, . . . , p)
is annihilated by (4.5).

Proposition 4.5. The expression
            X       1 P                                                 ǫD

is divisible by (detX)λp+1 . Furthermore the resulting expression is independent of
the variables xil (l = m + 1, . . . , p) and is annihilated by (4.5).
Proof. Since for a subset I of {1, . . . , m}, detXi (I)detXi (m + 1, . . . , p) is a scalar
multiple of detXdetXi (I ∪ {m + 1, . . . , p}) by Corollary 4.2 (iii), it follows that
the expression is divisible by (detX)λp+1 and independent of xil , for l = m +
1, . . . , p, after division. It is clear that it is annihilated by (4.5).

      D

depends only on the s-tuple (λp+1 , . . . , λp+s ) and thus we will denote this vector
by Γ(λp+1, . . . , λp+s ).
Proposition 4.6. The vector Γ(λp+1 , . . . , λp+s ) has weight corresponding to the
Young diagram (4.25).
Proof. Let fj , j = 1, . . . , m denote the number of marked boxes in D that appear
in the j-th row of some diagram Di . Then detYD has weight
                 λp+1                     m                  λp+1              λp+1

                        (λ′j   − p)δj +          fj ǫj −             ej δj +          (λ′j − p)δ̃j ,
                 j=1                      j=1                 j=1               j=1

while the expression (detX)−λp+1 detXD detZ has weight
                 m                        λp+1            λp+1                m                     p
                 X                        X               X                   X                     X
          λp+1         ǫj + (p − m)              δj +            ej δj −            fj ǫj + λp+1           ǫ˜j .
                 j=1                      j=1             j=1                 j=1                    j=1

So the combined weight is
                   m                  p                λp+1                          λp+1
                   X                  X                X                             X
            λp+1          ǫj + λp+1         ǫ˜j +             (λ′j   − m)δj +               (λ′j − p)δ̃j ,
                   j=1                j=1              j=1                            j=1

which of course is the weight of the Young diagram (4.25).
  Combining our results in this section we have proved

     where 0 ≤ r ≤ n is defined by               λ′r   > m and λ′r+1 ≤ m.

(iii) In the case when λp+1 > 0 it is given by
                                                            r ′               t

                                                            i=r+1            i=r ′ +1
                          ′
        where r ≤ r are defined as in (4.23) and p + s is the length of λ.
Proof. The only thing that remains to prove is that the vector in (iii) is in-
deed killed by (4.5). But this is because of the presence of Z in the formula of
Γ(λp+1 , . . . , λp+s ) and so is an immediate consequence of Corollary 4.1.

         5. Construction of highest weight vectors in S(S 2 Cm|n )
  In this section we will give an explicit formula for a highest weight vector of
each irreducible gl(m|n)-module that appear in the symmetric algebra of the
symmetric square of the natural gl(m|n)-module. According to Theorem 3.4 we
have the following decomposition of S(S 2 Cm|n ) as a gl(m|n)-module:

where the summation is over all partitions λ with even rows and λm+1 ≤ n.
   We let {x1 , . . . , xm ; ξ1 , . . . , ξn } be the standard basis for Cm|n , with xi denoting
even, and ξj odd vectors. Regarding xi as even and ξj as odd variables the Lie
supealgebra gl(m|n) has a natural identification with the space of first order
differential operators over C[xi , ξj ]. The Cartan subalgebra of diagonal matrices
is then spanned by its standard basis xi ∂x∂ i and ξj ∂ξ∂j , for i = 1, . . . , m and
j = 1, . . . , n. The nilpotent radical is generated by the simple root vectors

S 2 Cm|n then is spanned by the vectors xij = xji = xi xj , ykl = −ylk = ξk ξl and
ηki = ξk xi , where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k, l ≤ n. This allows us to identify
S(S 2 Cm|n ) with the polynomial algebra over C in the even variables xij and ykl
and odd variables ηki , with 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k < l ≤ n, which we denote
by C[x, y, η].

we mean to replace the i-th row of the matrix X by the vector (ηj1 , ηj2, . . . , ηjm).
In these forms the action of (5.1) will be more transparent.
   Consider the first r × r minor ∆r of the m × m matrix X, for 1 ≤ r ≤P          m. It is
easily seen to be a highest weight vector in C[x, y, η] of highest weight 2( ri=1 ǫi ),
where as before we use ǫi and δk to denote the fundamental weights of gl(m|n).
Hence if λ is a Young diagram with even rows of length not exceeding m, then
its corresponding highest weight vector is a product of ∆r ’s. To be explicit note
that since λ has even rows, λ1 = 2t is an even number. Furthermore we also
have λ′2i−1 = λ′2i , for all i = 1, . . . , t. Then the highest weight vector is given by

   i=1 ∆λ2i .

Thus it is enough to construct vectors associated to the Young diagrams of the
form (5.2). To do so we first consider the case when l = 1 in (5.2).
   Consider the expression
 (5.3)                       ∆(ξ1 , ξ2 ) := − (detX)(ξ1 ξ2 ) + (detX1 (ξ1 ))(ξ2 x1 )

where by (ξ1 ξ2 ) and (ξ2 xi ) we mean y12 and η2i , respectively. The following lemma
will be useful later on.
Lemma 5.1. Let A = (aij ) be a complex symmetric m×m matrix and θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θm
be odd variables. Then

Proof. It is enough to restrict ourselves to real symmetric m × m matrices A. Let

Lemma 5.2. ∆(ξ1 , ξ2) has weight 2( m  i=1 ǫi ) + δ1 + δ2 and hence its weight cor-
responds to the weight of the Young diagram (5.2) with l = 1.



Lemma 5.3. ∆(ξ1 , ξ2) is annihilated by all operators in (5.1) and hence is a
highest weight vector in S(S 2 Cm|n ) corresponding to the Young diagram (5.2)
with l = 1.

Proof. First consider the action of the operator xi−1 ∂x∂ i , for i = 2, . . . , m, on
∆(ξ1 , ξ2 ) given as in (5.3). Certainly xi−1 ∂x∂ i annihilates the first summand of
(5.3), and furthermore it takes the summand Xj (ξ1 )(ξ2 xj ) for j 6= i − 1, i to

The first summand is zero, while the second summand remains. Now we verify
similarly that xi−1 ∂x∂ i takes Xi−1 (ξ1 )(ξ2 xi−1 ) to the identical expression as the
second summand above with the difference that the i − 1-st and i-th rows are
interchanged. Thus xi−1 ∂x∂ i (∆(ξ1 , ξ2 )) = 0.
   Consider now the action of xm ∂ξ∂1 on ∆(ξ1 , ξ2 ). Note that xm ∂ξ∂1 kills every
term in (5.3) except for the first and the last. The contribution from the first
summand is −detX(ξ2xm ), while that from the last summand is detX(ξ2 xm ), and
hence xm ∂ξ∂1 (∆(ξ1 , ξ2 )) = 0.
   Finally we consider the action of ξ1 ∂ξ∂2 on (∆(ξ1 , ξ2 )) as in (5.3). ξ1 ∂ξ∂2 kills the
first term in (5.3) and the resulting vector is

                                      i=1



which can be in a consistent form with our earlier notation written as ∆(ξ1 , ξ1).
Expanding along the first row we see that (5.5) is the same as

   The proof of the above theorem gives us certain identities that will be used
later on. We will collect them here for the convenience of the reader:

(5.9)                              ∆(ξj , ξj ) = 0.
    We now turn our attention to the general case of a Young diagram of the form
(5.2) with general l. Of course we have the restriction that 2l ≤ n.
    Let σ = {(i1 , i2 ), (i3 , i4 ), . . . , (i2l−1 , i2l )} be a partition of the set {1, 2, . . . , 2l}.
Assuming that we have arranged σ in the form so that i1 < i2 , i3 < i4 , . . . , i2l−1 <
i2l , we may define ǫσ to be the sign of the permutation taking k to ik for all 1 ≤
k ≤ 2l. We may associate to σ a vector ∆(ξi1 , ξi2 ) · · · ∆(ξi2l−1 , ξi2l ) in S(S 2 Cm|n )
and define
                                        X
                          Γ(2l) =             ǫσ ∆(ξi1 , ξi2 ) · · · ∆(ξi2l−1 , ξi2l ),
                                       σ

where the sum is taken over all partition σ = {(i1 , i2 ), (i3 , i4 ), . . . , (i2l−1 , i2l )} of
the set {1, 2, . . . , 2l} arranged in the form that i1 < i2 , i3 < i4 , . . . , i2l−1 < i2l .
The following lemma is again a straightforward computation.
                                            P            P2l
Lemma 5.4. The weight of Γ(2l) is 2l( m       i=1 ǫi ) +  j=1 δj and hence corresponds
to the weight of the Young diagram (5.2).

Lemma 5.5. Γ(2l) is annihilated by (5.1) and hence a highest weight vector in
S(S 2 Cm|n ).
Proof. The fact that Γ(2l) is annihilated by xi−1 ∂x∂ i for i = 2, . . . , m is a conse-
quence of (5.6). Now the proof of Lemma 5.3 shows that xm ∂ξ∂1 (∆(ξ1 , ξs )) = 0,
for every s = 1, . . . , n. Thus xm ∂ξ∂1 annihilates Γ(2l) as well. So it remains to
show that ξj−1 ∂ξ∂ j kills Γ(2l).
   Given a summand in Γ(2l) of the form ǫσ · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξl ) · · · ∆(ξj , ξi ) · · · there
exists a summand of the form ǫσ′ · · · ∆(ξj−1 , ξi ) · · · ∆(ξj , ξl ) · · · , which is identical
to it except at these two places. Now ξj−1 ∂ξ∂ j takes the first of the two summands
above to
                           ǫσ · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξl ) · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξi ) · · · ,
and the second summand to
                              ǫσ′ · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξi ) · · · ∆(ξj−1 , ξl ) · · · .
40                       SHUN-JEN CHENG AND WEIQIANG WANG

But σ and σ ′ differ by a transposition (i, l) and hence ǫσ = −ǫσ′ and so these two
terms cancel.
  Consider a summand in Γ(2l) of the form ǫσ · · · ∆(ξl , ξj−1) · · · ∆(ξj , ξi ) · · · . But
in Γ(2l) we also have a summand of the form ǫσ′ · · · ∆(ξl , ξj ) · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξi ) · · · .
Applying ξj−1 ∂ξ∂j to these two terms, we again see that they cancel by the same
reasoning as before.
  Now we look at a term of the form ǫσ · · · ∆(ξj , ξl ) · · · ∆(ξi , ξj−1) · · · . We also
have a term of the form ǫσ′ · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξl ) · · · ∆(ξi , ξj ) · · · . Again they will cancel
each other after applying ξj−1 ∂ξ∂j .
   Finally a term of the form ǫσ′ · · · ∆(ξj−1, ξj ) · · · is killed by ξj−1 ∂ξ∂j by (5.9).
This completes the proof.
  It is clear that a product of Γ(2l)’s (not necessarily the same l) is non-zero,
which therefore allows us to construct all other highest weight vectors, as dis-
cussed in the beginning of this section. Below we summarize the results of this
section.
Theorem 5.1. The gl(m|n)-highest weight vectors of S(S 2 Cm|n ) form an abelian
semigroup generated by Γ(2), . . . , Γ(2[ n2 ]) and ∆1 , . . . , ∆m , where [ n2 ] denotes the
largest integer not exceeding n2 . Furthermore this semigroup is free if and only if
n = 0, 1. More precisely a highest weight vector associated to an even partition
λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) with λm+1 ≤ n is given by
                                  Pl             l
                                                 Y              l
                                                                Y           1
                        (detX)−     i=m+2   λi
                                                       Γ(λi )       (∆λ′j ) 2 ,
                                                 m+1            j=r+1

where the non-negative integer r is defined by λ′r > m and λ′r+1 ≤ m.

Remark 5.1. From Theorem 5.1 we may recover the highest weight vectors in
S(S 2 Cm ) and S(Λ2 Cn ) by putting n = 0 and m = 0, respectively. Namely, iden-
tifying S 2 Cm (respectively Λ2 Cn ) with the space of symmetric m×m (respectively
skew-symmetric n × n) matrices, we see that in the first case the highest weight
vectors are generated by the leading minors of the determinant of the typical
element of S 2 Cm , while in the second case they are generated by the Pfaffians
of the leading 2l × 2l minors of the the typical element of Λ2 Cn , where 2l ≤ n.
