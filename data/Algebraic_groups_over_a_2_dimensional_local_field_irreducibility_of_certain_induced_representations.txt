                                                    Abstract. Let G be a split reductive group over a local field K, and let G((t)) be the
                                                    corresponding loop group. In [1] we have introduced the notion of a representation
                                                    of (the group of K-points) of G((t)) on a pro-vector space. In addition, we have
                                                    defined an induction procedure, which produced G((t))-representations from usual
                                                    smooth representations of G. We have conjectured that the induction of a cuspidal
                                                    irreducible representation of G is irreducible. In this paper we prove this conjecture
                                                    for G = SL2 .

                                             1.1. Notation. The notation in this paper follows closely that of [1]. Let remind
                                             the main characters. We denote by Set0 the category of finite sets, and Set :=
                                             Ind(Pro(Set0 )), Set = Ind(Pro(Set)). By V ect0 we denote the category of finite-
                                             dimensional vector spaces over C, V ect = Ind(V ect0 ) is the category of all vector
                                             spaces, and Vect is the category Pro(V ect) of pro-vector spaces.
                                                Let G be a split reductive group over K; G the corresponding group-object of Set.
                                             We have the pro-algebraic group of arcs G[[t]] and for n ∈ N we denote by Gn ⊂ G[[t]]
                                             the corresponding congruence subgroup. By G[[t]] (resp., Gn ⊂ G[[t]]) we denote the
                                             corresponding group-objects of Pro(Set).
                                                Finally G = G((t)) is the group-object of Set, which is our main object of study. We
                                             denote by Rep(G) the category of representations of G on Vect, cf. [1], Sect. 2.
                                             1.2. Let us recall the formulation of Conjecture 4.7 of [1]. Recall that we have an exact
                                                      G : Rep(G) → Rep(G, Vect), and its right adjoint, denoted iG and called the
                                             functor rG                                                               G

                                               Let π be an irreducible cuspidal representation of G, and set Π := iGG (π). In [1],
                                             Sect. 4.5 it was shown that the cuspidality assumption on π implies that the natural
                                             map
                                                                                 G        G

                                             is an isomorphism. In particular, this implies that
                                                                                      G

                                               We have formulated:
                                                                                              1

Conjecture 1.3. The object Π ∈ Rep(G) is irreducible.
    In this paper we will prove:
Theorem 1.4. Conjecture 1.3 holds for G = SL2 .
  Note that in [1] Conjecture 1.3 was stated slightly more generally, when we allow
representations of a central extension Gb with a given central charge. The proof of
Theorem 1.4 generalizes to this set-up in a straightforward way.
   It should be remarked that from the definition of the category of representations of
G((t)), it is not at all clear that G((t)) admits any non-trivial irreducible representations
is non-obvious. Therefore, the fact that the above-mentioned irreducibility conjecture
holds is somewhat surprising.
1.5. We will now consider a functor Rep(G, Vect) → Rep(G), which will be the left
adjoint of the functor rG G.

   First, recall from [2], Proposition 2.7, that the functor CoinvG1 : Rep(G1 , Vect) →
                                               1
Vect does admit a left adjoint, denoted Inf G .
Proposition 1.6. The functor CoinvG1 : Rep(G[[t]], Vect) → Rep(G, Vect) admits a
left adjoint.
Proof. For π = (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(G, Vect), consider the functor Rep(G[[t]], Vect) → V ect
given by
                         Π 7→ HomRep(G,Vect) (π, CoinvG1 (Π)).
   We claim that it is enough to show that this functor is pro-representable. Indeed,
this follows by combining Lemma 1.2, Proposition 2.5 an Lemma 2.7 of [1].
                            1
   Consider the object Inf G (V) ∈ Rep(G1 , Vect), where V is regarded just as a pro-
vector space, and
                             G[[t]]  1
                       CoindG1 (Inf G (V)) ∈ Rep(G[[t]], Vect),
              G[[t]]
where CoindG1          is as in [2], Corollary 2.34.
  Evidently,
              HomRep(G,Vect) (π, Coinv G1 (Π)) ֒→ HomVect (V, CoinvG1 (Π)),
and the latter, in turn, identifies with
                                                                          
                           1                                G[[t]]   1
   HomRep(G1 ,Vect) Inf G (V), Π ≃ HomRep(G[[t]],Vect) CoindG1 (Inf G (V)), Π .
    Hence, the pro-representability follows from Proposition 1.4 of [1].
                                                                                                
                                                       G[[t]]
  We will denote the resulting functor by Inf G                 . Note that by construction, for a
representation π of G we have a surjection
                                       G[[t]]   1                G[[t]]
                                  CoindG1 (Inf G (π)) ։ Inf G             (π).
                         G[[t]]
  By composing Inf G       with the functor CoindG
                                                 G[[t]] : Rep(G[[t]], Vect) → Rep(G) we
                                   G
obtain a functor, left adjoint to rG .

   We will now formulate the main step in the proof of Theorem 1.4. Note that if π is
a cuspidal representation of G, isomorphism (1) implies that we have a canonical map
                                                     G[[t]]
(2)                             CoindG
                                     G[[t]] (Inf G            (π)) → Π.
  We will deduce Theorem 1.4 from the following one:
Theorem 1.7. If G = SL2 , the map of (2) is surjective.
   Of course, we conjecture that the map (2) is surjective for any G, but we are unable
to prove that at the moment.

1.8. Let us show how Theorem 1.7 implies Theorem 1.4. Suppose that Π′ is a non-zero
sub-object of Π and let Π′′ := Π/Π′ be the quotient. By definition of the induction
functor, we have a map in Rep(G, Vect).
                                            G
                                           rG (Π′ ) → π.
   Using Proposition 2.4. of [1], we obtain that rG       G (Π′ ) must surject onto π, since the

latter was assumed irreducible. Since the functor rG          G is exact (cf. Lemma 2.6. of

loc.cit.), and because of isomorphism (1), this implies that rG      G (Π′′ ) = 0.
                                           G[[t]]
   However, HomRep(G) (CoindG  G[[t]] (Inf G      (π), Π′′ ) ≃ HomRep(G,Vect) (π, rGG (Π′′ ). By

Theorem 1.7, this implies that Π′′ = 0.

                                    2. The key lemma
2.1. The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.7. We will slightly
abuse the notation, and for a scheme Y over K we will make no distinction between
the corresponding object Y ∈ Set and Y (K), regarded as a topological space.
   Recall the affine Grassmannian GrG = G((t))/G[[t]] of G, and the corresponding ob-
ject GrG ∈ Ind(Set). Let us represent GrG as the direct limit of closures of G[[t]]-orbits,
GrλG , with respect to the natural partial ordering on the set of dominant coweights.
   Let us also denote by Grf G the ind-scheme G((t))/G1 , which is a principal G-bundle
over GrG . Let Grf λ and Grf λ denote the preimages in Grf G of the G[[t]]-orbit Grλ and
                   G         G                                                      G
                               f λ and Gr
its closure, respectively. Let Gr        f λ denote the corresponding objects of Set.

   By construction (cf. [1], Sect. 3.9), as a G[[t]]-representation, Π is the inverse limit
    λ                λ
of Π , where each Π is the vector space consisting of locally constant G-equivariant
             f λ with values in π.

  Set Πλ be the kernel of Π → ⊕ Π . Let ev denote the natural evaluation map
                                        λ′ <λ
Π→    Π0                                          f λ , π) to f (1). More generally, for
         ≃ π, which sends a function f ∈ Functlc (Gr G
     f λ
ge ∈ GrG , we will denote by eveg the map Π → π, corresponding to evaluation at eg.
   To prove Theorem 1.7 we must show that the composition

is surjective for every λ. We will argue by induction. Therefore, let us first check that
the map of (3) is indeed surjective for λ = 0.
   We have a natural map
                                                                         

(4)                Inf G (π) → Inf G (π) → CoindG  G[[t]]   Inf G      (π)  ,

and its composition with
                                                      
                                             G[[t]]        ev
                            CoindG
                                 G[[t]]  Inf G      (π)  →Π→π
                               1
is the natural surjection Inf G (π) → π.
    Thus, we have to carry out the induction step. We will suppose that the composition
                                                      
                                             G[[t]]          λ′
                          CoindGG[[t]]   Inf G      (π)  →Π→Π

is surjective for λ′ < λ, and we must show that
                                                     
                                            G[[t]]

                                                           Π

is surjective as well.

2.2. For λ as above let tλ be the corresponding point in G((t)). By a slight abuse of
                                                                 f G.

                           1
   Consider the action of G ⊂ G((t)) on GrG given by
                                          g × x = Adtλ (g) · x.
Let Y ⊂ GrG be the closure of Adtλ (G1 ) · GrλG . Let Gλ be a finite-dimensional quotient
of G1 , through which it acts on Y .
   We will denote by Y and Gλ , respectively, the corresponding objects of Set. Let ΠY
denote the quotient of Π, equal to the space of G-equivariant locally constant π-valued
functions on the set of K-points of the preimage of Y in Grf G.

   Let N ⊂ G be the maximal unipotent subgroup. Since λ is dominant, Adtλ (N [[t]])
is a subgroup of N [[t]]. Let N λ ⊂ N [[t]] be any normal subgroup of finite codimension,
contained in Adtλ (N [[t]]). (Later we will specify to the case when G = SL2 ; then
N ≃ Ga and is abelian, and we will take N λ = Adtλ (N [[t]]).) Let Nλ denote the
quotient N [[t]]/N λ , and let Nλ be the corresponding group-object in Set.
   Let now KN be an open compact subgroup in Nλ , and KGλ an open compact
subgroup in Gλ .
  Now we are ready to state our main technical claim, Main Lemma 2.4. However,
before doing that, let us explain the idea behind this lemma:
  From the isomorphism (1), we will obtain Rthat for any f ∈ ΠY and a large compact
subgroup KGλ as above, the integral f ′ :=       f k ”localizes” near tλ , i.e., f ′ will be 0
                                                   k∈KGλ
outside a ”small” ball around      tλ .
                                We will then average f ′ with respect to a fixed open
subgroup KN of Nλ , and obtain a new element, denoted f ′′ ∈ Πλ .

  Main Lemma 2.4 will insure that the compact subgroup KGλ can be chosen so that f ′′
will still be localized near tλ , and such the resulting elements f ′′ for various subgroups
KN , and their translations by elements of G((t)), span Πλ .
2.3. In precise terms, we proceed as follows. Consider the operator AKN ,KGλ : Π → π
given by                           Z      Z
                             f 7→             evtλ (f n·k ),
                                    n∈KN k∈KGλ

where the integral is taken with respect to the Haar measures on both groups. (In the
above formula f 7→ f x denotes the action of x ∈ G((t)) on Π.) By the definition of
ΠY , the above map factors through Π ։ ΠY → π.
                   f λ we have a map A
  For a point ge ∈ GrG                g ,KGλ : Π → π given by
                                      e
                                     Z
                                f 7→      eveg (f k ).
                                          k∈KGλ

This map also factors through ΠY .
  Our main technical claim, which we prove for G = SL2 is the following. (We do not
know whether an analogous statement holds for groups G of higher rank.)
Main Lemma 2.4. For v ∈ π, an open compact subgroup KN ⊂ Nλ and open compact
subset X ⊂ GrλG containing tλ , there exists a finite-dimensional subspace F(v) ⊂ ΠY
and an increasing exhausting family of compact subgroups KG  α (v) ⊂ G such that:
                                                              λ        λ
(1) For all sufficiently large indices α the vector v would belong to the image of
AKN ,KGα (v) (F(v)).

(2) For every f ∈ F(v) and for all sufficiently large indices α, the vector Aeg,KG
                                                                                   λ

will vanish, unless the image of ge under Gr → Gr belongs to X.

2.5. Let us show how Lemma 2.4 implies the induction step in the proof of Theo-
rem 1.7.
  Recall that the orbit of the point tλ under the action of N [[t]] is open in GrλG . For
an open compact subgroup KN ⊂ Nλ , let X ⊂ GrλG be its orbit under KN . Let
  λ         λ
(Π )KN ⊂ Π be the subspace of KN -invariants. We have a direct sum decomposition
                                      λ
                                   (Π )KN = V1 ⊕ V2 ,
where the first direct summand consists of functions that vanish on the preimage of X,
and the second one functions of sections that vanish outside the preimage of X. We
have V2 ⊂ Πλ and the map evtλ identifies V2 with π.
   We claim that it suffices to show that the image of the map
                                               

where the last arrow is given by averaging with respect to KN , contains V2 .

   Indeed, let G[[t]]λ be a finite-dimensional quotient through which G[[t]] acts on GrλG ,
and let G[[t]]λ be the corresponding group-object of Set. The vector space Πλ is
spanned by elements of the following form. Each is invariant under some (small) open
compact subgroup KG[[t]]λ ⊂ G[[t]]λ , and is supported on a preimage in Grf λ of a single
                                                                              G
KG[[t]]λ -orbit on GrλG . By G[[t]]-invariance, we can assume that the orbit in question
is that of the element tλ ∈ GrλG .
   By setting KN := Nλ ∩ KG[[t]]λ , we obtain that any element of the form specified
above is contained in the corresponding V2 .
    We will show that Main Lemma 2.4 implies that V2 belongs to the image of the map

where first the arrow is the composition of the map of (4), followed by the action of tλ .
   For that let us write down in explicit terms the composition

   First, let us observe that the resulting map factors through the surjection Inf G (π) ։
Inf Gλ (π). Secondly, let us recall (cf. [2], Sect. 2.8) that Inf Gλ (π) is the inductive limit,
taken in Vect, over finite-dimensional subspaces F′ ⊂ π of

       α runs through any exhausting family of open compact subgroups of G .

   By (1), the map ΠY →      π induces an isomorphism CoinvGλ (ΠY ) ≃ π. For a given
finite-dimensional subspace F′ let us choose a finite-dimensional subspace F ⊂ ΠY which
projects surjectively onto F′ , and for every index α consider the map

where f ∈ F and µ ∈                 α )
                       Distrc (Gλ /KG  is regarded as an element of the Hecke algebra.

  The resulting system of maps (eventually in α) factors through Distrc (Gλ /KG α )⊗
                                                                                  λ

   Let us now recall that if W = lim Wα is a pro-vector space mapping to a vector
                                      ←−
space V, the surjectivity of this map means that the eventually defined maps Wα → V
are all surjective, or, which is the same, that ∀v ∈ V, v ∈ Im(Wα ) for those indices α,
for which the map W → V factors through Wα → V.
   For a vector v ∈ π, let F(v) be the finite-dimensional subspace of ΠY , given by
Lemma 2.4, and let KG     α (v) be the corresponding system of subgroups. Let F′ (v)
                           λ
denote the image of F(v) in π.
   Consider the composition:

            λ
   This establishes the required surjectivity.


                              3. Proof of Main Lemma 2.4
3.1. For a given subgroup KN ⊂ Nλ , a subset X ⊂ GrλG and an arbitrary finite-
dimensional subspace F ⊂ ΠY we will construct a family of open compact subgroups
KGλ ⊂ Gλ , such that the expressions

                                AKN ,KGλ (f ) and Aeg,KGλ (f )

for f ∈ F can be evaluated explicitly.

  From now on we will fix G = SL2 . We will change the notation slightly, and identify
the set of dominant coweights with N; in which case we will replace λ by l and tλ ∈
G((t)) becomes the matrix
                                    l      
                                      t   0
                                              .
                                      0 t−l

  Let us translate our initial subscheme Y by t−λ , in which case the point tλ itself will
go over to the unit point 1GrG ∈ GrG ,and t−λ ·Y will be contained in Gr2l
                                                                           G . (We denote
                                        t r  0
by GrrG the G[[t]]-orbit of the point             in GrG , and by GrrG its closure.) For
                                        0 t−r
the purposes of Lemma 2.4 we can replace t−λ · Y by the entire Gr2l G , with the standard
action of the congruence subgroup G1 .
  Note that the action of G1 on Gr2l               f 2l                      1   4l (resp.,
                                        G (resp., GrG ) factors through G /G
G1 /G4l+1 ).

  For an integer r let us denote by Gr the quotient G1 /G2r+1 , and by Nr the quotient
t−r· N [[t]]/N [[t]]. We will write elements of Nr as Σ t−i · ni with ni ∈ K, and thus
                                                       1≤i≤r
think of it as an r-dimensional vector space over K.
   Similarly, we will identify Gr := G1 /G2r+1 with an 6r-dimensional vector space over
K, by writing its elements as matrices:
                                                  

and klm =     Σ      ti · (klm )i . In particular, we can speak of OK -lattices in Gr , where
            1≤i≤2r
OK ⊂ K is the ring of integers.

3.4. Let us deduce Main Lemma 2.4 from Proposition 3.3. Given a vector v ∈ π let
                                     r
us first define the subspace F(v) ∈ Π .
   Recall that N ≃ K is the maximal unipotent subgroup of G = SL2 (K), and let N∗
denote the Pontriagin dual group. Since N∗ is also (non-canonically) isomorphic to
K, we have a valuation map ν : N∗ → Z, defined up to a shift. In particular, we can
consider the subalgebra Functval (N∗ ) :≃ Funct(Z) inside the algebra Functlc (N∗ ) of all
locally constant functions on N∗ .
                 IRREDUCIBILITY OF CERTAIN INDUCED REPRESENTATIONS                          9

   Any smooth representation of N, and in particular π, can be thought of as a module
over the algebra of Functlc (N∗ ), such that every element of this module has compact
support. If a representation is cuspidal, this means that the support of every section is
disjoint from 0 ∈ N∗ .
   Therefore, if v is a vector in a cuspidal representation π, the vector space
Functval (N∗ ) · v ⊂ π is finite-dimensional. We denote this vector subspace by F′ (v)
                   r
and let F(v) ⊂ Π to be any subspace surjecting onto F′ (v) by means of ev. We claim
that F(v) satisfies the requirements of Main Lemma 2.4.
   Property (2) in the lemma is satisfied due to Proposition 3.3(2). To check property
(1) we will rewrite AKN ,KGλ (f ) more explicitly in terms of the action of G on π.
   Note that by Proposition 3.3(1c), the integral
                                   Z      Z
                                               ev(f n·k )
                                   n∈KNr k∈KGr

equals the integral over a smaller domain, namely,
                                   Z    Z
                                             ev(f n·k ).

   By Proposition 3.3(1a) and (1b), the latter can be rewritten as
                       Z     Z                            !

  For n = Σ t−i · ni ∈ Nr consider the map φn : Gr → N, given by
                                                      !                         !
                1 + Σ ti · (k11 )i   Σ ti · (k12 )i        1   Σ (k12 )2i · n2i

                   i                    i
Thus, the expression in (8) can be rewritten as
                              Z
(9)                                (φn )∗ (µ(KGr )) · ev(f ),

                              n∈KN r

where µ(KGr ) denotes the Haar measure of KGr , and (φn )∗ (µ(KGr )) is its push-
forward under φn , regarded as a distribution on N.
   Note, however, that when we identify Gr ≃ G1 /G2r+1 with a linear space over K,
the Haar measure on this group goes over to a linear Haar measure. From this we
obtain that for each n ∈ Nr , the distribution (φn )∗ (µ(KGr )), thought of as a function
on N∗ , is the characteristic function of some OK -lattice in N∗ . Moreover, this lattice
grows as n → 0.
   In particular,
           R      (φn )∗ (µ(KGr )), as a function on N∗ , belongs to Functval (N∗ ), and the
integral        (φn )∗ (µ(KGr )), being positive at every point of N∗ , defines an invertible
           sm
        n∈KN r
element of Functval (N∗ ).

which is what we had to show.

                                 4. Proof of Proposition 3.3
4.1. We will construct the subgroup KGr by induction with respect to the parameter
                                    r−1
r. (For property (2) we take X ∩ GrG as the corresponding open compact subset of
   r−1
GrG .)
   When r = 0 all the subgroups in question are trivial. So, we can assume having
constructed the subgroups KGr−1 and KN   sm , and let us perform the induction step.
                                           r−1
The key observation is provided by the following lemma:
                                             r                               r
   R 4.2. Let k X be a compact subset of GrG and f ∈ Π . Then the integral

        eveg (f ) = 0 if KG2r /G2r+1 is a sufficiently large compact subgroup of
k∈KG2r /G2r+1
G2r /G2r+1 , and      g ) ∈ X.

                                                     
                                               tr 0
Proof. Since    GrrGis a G[[t]]-orbit of    tλ
                                           :=           and since G2r is normalized by
                                               0 t−r
G[[t]] and acts trivially on GrrG , by the compactness of X, the assertion of the lemma
reduces to the fact that               Z
                                                    evtλ (f k ) = 0
                                    k∈KG2r /G2r+1

for every sufficiently large subgroup KG2r /G2r+1 .
   Note that for k ∈ G2r written as
                                                            
                                 1 + t2r · k11   t2r · k12
                                                               ,
                                   t2r · k21   1 + t2r · k22
Adtλ (k) ∈ G[[t]] projects to the element

                                 1 k12
                                         ∈ G = G[[t]]/G1 .
                                 0 1
We have
                                  evtλ (f k ) = Adtλ (k) · evtλ (f ).
   Therefore, the integral in question equals the averaging of the vector evtλ (f ) ∈ π over
a compact subgroup of the maximal unipotent subgroup of G. Moreover, this subgroup
grows together with KG2r /G2r+1 . Hence, our assertion follows from the cuspidality of
π.
                                                                                          

4.3. To carry out the induction step we first choose KG ′   ⊂ Gr to be any OK -lattice,
                                                          r

   By continuity and the compactness of KG ′   there exists an OK -lattice L ⊂ K, such

         equals that of

  Note that for any n ∈ Nr , k′ ∈ Gr and

   The group KGr will be obtained from KG        ′   by adding to it an (arbitrarily large)
                                                   r
             2r
lattice in G /G   2r+1 .
   Note that since G2r acts trivially on GrrG , any such subgroup would satisfy condition
(1a) of Proposition 3.3, because KGr satisfies (a’) above. It will also automatically
satisfy (1b) in view of (10) and (b’) above. Thus, we have to arrange so that KGr
satisfies conditions (1c) and (2) of Proposition 3.3.

4.4. By Lemma 4.2, we can find an open compact subgroup KG2r /G2r+1 ⊂ G2r /G2r+1 ,
such that the integrals
                                   Z
                                                  ′
                                          ev(f n·k ·k )
                                   k∈KG2r /G2r+1

would vanish for f ∈ F, k′ ∈ KG ′
                                  r
                                    and n ∈ KNr is such that nr ∈  / L.
  Let us enlarge the initial KGr by adding to it any OK -lattice in G2r /G2r+1 containing
                              ′

the above KG2r /G2r+1 . We claim that the resulting subgroup satisfies condition (1c) of
Proposition 3.3.
  Indeed, let n = n′ + t−r nr , n′ ∈ Nr−1 , nr ∈ K be an element in KNr − KN   sm . If
                                                                                r
   / L, the integral vanishes by the choice of KG2r /G2r+1 . Thus, we can assume that
nr ∈
nr ∈ L, but n′ ∈ / KNsm . But then the integral vanishes by (c’) and the induction
                       r−1
hypothesis..

  Now, let us deal with condition (2) of Proposition 3.3. By the induction hypothesis,
the integrals
                                      Z
(11)                                      ev(f g·k )

                                            k∈KG r
                      r−1        r−1
vanish when g ∈ GrG       − (GrG     ∩ X).
   Hence, by continuity and since KG   ′   is compact, there exists a neighbourhood X1 of
                                         r
    r−1        r−1             r
GrG − (GrG ∩ X) in GrG − X, such that the integral (11) will vanish for the same
subgroup KG  ′   and all g for which g ∈ X1 .
               r
   The sought-for subgroup KGr will be again obtained from the initial KG     ′   by adding
                                                                                r
to it an arbitrarily large open compact subgroup of G /G  2r   2r+1 . We claim that for any
such KGr the integral
                                          Z
(12)                                           ev(f g·k )
                                            k∈KGr

will still vanish for g ∈ X1 .
   This follows from the fact that the G2r -action on GrrG is trivial, and hence for k ∈
G , k′ ∈ Gr and g ∈ G((t)) projecting to g ∈ GrrG ,
  2r

                                    f (k · k′ · g) = k1 · f (k′ · g)
for some k1 ∈ G.
   We choose the suitable subgroup in G2r /G2r+1 as follows. Set X2 = (GrrG −X)−X1 .
This is a compact subset of GrrG , and let us apply Lemma 4.2 to the compact set
KG′ · X ⊂ Grr .
   r    2      G
   We obtain that there exists an open compact subgroup KG2r /G2r+1 ⊂ G2r /G2r+1 ,
such that                         Z
                                                   ′
                                           ev(f g·k ·k ) = 0
                                    k∈K ′
                                        G2r /G2r+1

for g ∈ X2 ,   k′   ∈    ′ .
                        KG r

   Let KGr be the resulting subgroup of Gr . We claim that it does satisfy condition (2)
of Proposition 3.3. Indeed, consider again the integral (12) for g ∈ GrrG −X = X1 ∪X2 .
   We already know that it vanishes for g ∈ X1 . And if g ∈ X2 , it vanishes by the
choice of KGr .
   This completes the induction step in the proof of Proposition 3.3.
