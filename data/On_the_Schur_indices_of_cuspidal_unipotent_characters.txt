                                             Abstract. In previous work of Gow, Ohmori, Lusztig and the author, the Schur indices
                                             of all unipotent characters of finite groups of Lie type have been explicitly determined
                                             except for six cases in groups of type F4 , E7 and E8 . In this paper, we show that the
                                             Schur indices of all cuspidal unipotent characters for type F4 and E8 are 1, assuming
                                             that the group is defined over a field of “good” characteristic. This settles four out of
                                             the six open cases. For type E7 , we show that the Schur indices are at most 2.

                                             By the work of Feit, Gow, Ohmori, Turull, . . ., one expects that the Schur index
                                             of an irreducible character of a finite simple group is 1 or 2. This paper is a
                                             contribution to a solution of this problem, as far as the unipotent characters of a
                                             finite group of Lie type are concerned. By Lusztig [17], the Schur indices of all
                                             rational-valued unipotent characters are generally 1. However, there are exceptions
                                             in the finite unitary groups (Ohmori [21]) and the Ree groups 2F4 (q) ([6]) where
                                             the Schur indices are 2. In [6], we were also able to compute the Schur indices of
                                             some non-rational valued unipotent characters, but not all. This paper deals with
                                             some of the remaining cases, which arise in groups of type F4 , E7 and E8 .
                                                 Our principal tool are Kawanaka’s generalized Gelfand–Graev characters [12].
                                             These are characters induced from certain unipotent subgroups. It is known that
                                             every unipotent character occurs with “small” multiplicity in such an induced char-
                                             acter. We shall show here that certain generalized Gelfand–Graev representations
                                             can actually be realized over Q (in type F4 or E8 ) or over a quadratic extension
                                             of Q (in type E7 ). The method for doing this is inspired by Ohmori [20], who
                                             considered the case of ordinary Gelfand–Graev representations. Furthermore, us-
                                             ing the explicit multiplicity formulas obtained by Kawanaka [12] and Lusztig [15],
2                                           Geck


we check that the unipotent characters that we wish to consider all occur with
multiplicity 1 in those generalized Gelfand–Graev representations.
    Combining the previous work by Ohmori, Lusztig and the author with the
results obtained in this paper, the known results on Schur indices of unipotent
characters can be summarized as follows. Let G be a simple algebraic group and
F : G → G be an endomomorphism such that GF is a finite (twisted or untwisted)
group of Lie type. Let ρ be a unipotent irreducible character of GF . Then the
Schur index of ρ is given as follows.
    (1) Assume that ρ is cuspidal and rational-valued.
         (a) If GF is of type 2An−1 where n = s(s + 1)/2 for some s > 1, then the
             Schur index of the unique cuspidal unipotent character of GF is 1 if n
             is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, and 2 otherwise; see Ohmori [21].
         (b) If GF is a Ree group of type 2F4 , then the Schur index of the unique
             cuspidal unipotent character which occurs with even multiplicity in all
             Deligne–Lusztig generalized characters RT,1 is 2; see [6], Theorem 1.6.
         (c) In all other cases, the Schur index of ρ is 1; see Lusztig [17], Theorem 0.2.
    (2) Assume that ρ is cuspidal and not rational-valued. Then the Schur index of
        ρ is 1, except possibly for the two cuspidal unipotent characters in type E7
        (where the Schur index √is at most 2) or the two cuspidal unipotent characters
        with character field Q( −1) in type E8 over a field of characterictic 5; see
        Table 1 and Corollary 1.5 in [6], and Sections 2, 3 in the present paper. See
        Gow [9], p. 119, for groups of type 2B 2 and 2G2 .
    (3) Assume that ρ is unipotent but not necessarily cuspidal. Then ρ occurs with
                                                                 G
        non-zero multiplicity in the Harish-Chandra induction RL   (ψ) where L is an
        F -stable Levi complement in some F -stable proper parabolic subgroup of G
        and ψ is a cuspidal unipotent character of LF . In this situation, the Schur
        index of ρ equals that of ψ; see [6], Proposition 5.6.
Thus, there are two remaining cases to be dealt with:
     • the characters E7 [±ξ] in type E7 ;
                           √
     • the characters E8 [± −1] for a group of type E8 in characteristic 5.
For each of these cases, we show that the determination of the Schur index can
be reduced to the problem of computing explicitly the values of certain induced
characters. The latter problems are discussed in [7] and [10].




               2. On the rationality of generalized
                 Gelfand–Graev representations
The aim of this section is to show that certain generalized Gelfand–Graev repre-
sentations of a finite group of Lie type can be realized over Q. For this purpose,
                   Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters                   3

we have to recall in some detail the construction of these representations. We shall
freely use standard results and notations concerning (connected reductive) linear
algebraic groups and their Lie algebras (see Carter [2] and the references there).
    Let G be a connected reductive group defined over the finite field Fq , with
corresponding Frobenius map F : G → G. We fix an F -stable Borel subgroup
B ⊆ G and write B = U.T where U is the unipotent radical of B and T is an
F -stable maximal torus. Let X = Hom(T, k × ) be the character group of T and
Φ ⊆ X be the root system of G with respect to T . Then B determines a positive
system Φ+ ⊆ Φ and a corresponding set of simple roots Π ⊆ Φ+ . We have
                                                           Y
                   G = hT, Xα | α ∈ Φi      and      U=        Xα
                                                                     α∈Φ+

where Xα is the root subgroup corresponding to α ∈ Φ. (Here, it is understood
that the product is taken over some fixed order of the roots.) For each α ∈ Φ, let
α∨ ∈ Y = Hom(k × , T ) be the corresponding coroot. Given λ ∈ X and µ ∈ Y ,
let hλ, µi be the unique integer such that γ hλ,µi = (λ ◦ µ)(γ) for all γ ∈ k × . This
defines a non-degenerate pairing h , i : X × Y → Z; the matrix
                                              
                                C := hα, β ∨ i α,β∈Π
is the Cartan matrix of G. Now, for any α ∈ Φ, there is an isomorphism of
algebraic groups xα : k + → Xα such that
                txα (ξ)t−1 = xα (α(t)ξ)            for all t ∈ T and ξ ∈ k.
Since we will only need to consider this case, let us assume that F is of split type,
such that
                    F (xα (ξ)) = xα (ξ q )         for all α ∈ Φ, ξ ∈ k,
                                     q
                         F (t) = t                 for all t ∈ T .
We consider the conjugacy classes of unipotent elements in G. For this purpose,
we assume throughout that the characteristic p of Fq is a good prime for G. Recall
that this means that p is good for each simple factor involved in G, and that the
conditions for the various simple types are as follows.
                                         An    :   no condition,
                             Bn , Cn , Dn      :   p 6= 2,
                           G2 , F4 , E6 , E7   :   p 6= 2, 3,
                                          E8   :   p 6= 2, 3, 5.
Then it is known (see Kawanaka [12] and the references there; see also Premet
[22]) that one can naturally attach to each unipotent class of G a so-called weighted
Dynkin diagram, that is, an additive map
               d : Φ → Z such that d(α) ∈ {0, 1, 2} for all α ∈ Π.
The assignment from unipotent classes to additive maps as above is injective,
but not surjective in general. Complete lists of weighted Dynkin diagrams for
the various types of simple algebraic groups can be found in Carter [2], §13.1.
4                                          Geck


Given such a weighted Dynkin diagram d, the corresponding unipotent class is
determined as follows. We set
                                                          Y
         Ld := hT, Xα | α ∈ Φ, d(α) = 0i  and     Ud,i :=     Xα
                                                                    α∈Φ+
                                                                    d(α)>i


for i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Then Pd := Ud,1 .Ld is a parabolic subgroup of G, with unipotent
radical Ud,1 and Levi complement Ld . By Kawanaka [12], Theorem 2.1.1, there is
a unique unipotent class C in G such that C ∩ Ud,2 is dense in Ud,2 ; furthermore,
C ∩ Ud,2 is a single Pd -conjugacy class and we have

                          CG (u) ⊆ Pd      for all u ∈ C ∩ Ud,2 .

Then C is the unipotent class attached to the given weighted Dynkin diagram d.
   In order to define the generalized Gelfand–Graev representation associated with
                        F
an element u ∈ C ∩ Ud,2    , we need to introduce some further notation. Let g be
the Lie algebra of G over k = Fq . Then g is also defined over Fq and we have a
corresponding Frobenius map F : g → g. Let t ⊆ g be the Lie algebra of T . We
have a Cartan decomposition
                M
        g=t⊕         keα      where F (t) = t and F (eα ) = eα for all α ∈ Φ.
                 α∈Φ

We shall set cα := κ(e∗α , eα ) for any α ∈ Φ+ , where κ : g × g → k is a non-
degenerate G-invariant, associative bilinear form and x 7→ x∗ is an opposition
Fq -automorphism of g, that is, an automorphism such that t∗ = t and e∗α ∈ Fq e−α
for all α ∈ Φ (see Kawanaka [12], §3.1).
    Finally, we fix a non-trivial homomorphism χ : F+     ×
                                                    q → C .



                                                                 F
Definition 2.1 (Kawanaka). Consider a unipotent element u ∈ C ∩ Ud,2 ; write
                    Y            
                                      F
(∗)             u∈        xα (ηα ) · Ud,3   where ηα ∈ Fq .
                           α∈Φ+
                           d(α)=2


                                           F
With this notation, we define a map ϕu : Ud,2 → C× by
               Y                 X             
           ϕu        xα (ξα ) = χ        cα ηα ξα    where ξα ∈ Fq .
                 α∈Φ+                   α∈Φ+
                 d(α)>2                 d(α)=2


Since κ(eα , eβ ) = 0 unless α = −β, this definition coincides with Kawanaka’s
original definition in [12], (3.1.5); see also [5], Chapter 1. The map ϕu actually is
                                                           F
a group homomorphism, that is, a linear character of Ud,2    . Inducing that character
       F
from Ud,2  to GF , we obtain
                                F   
                           IndG          F      F 1/2
                              U F ϕu = [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] · Γu
                                d,2
                       Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters               5

where Γu is the character of the generalized Gelfand–Graev representation associ-
                                                                  F     F
ated with u; see Kawanaka [12], (3.1.12). Note that the index [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] is an
even power of q, so the square root exists.

Remark 2.2. In the above setting, let us choose another element u′ ∈ C ∩ Ud,2
                                                                          F
                                                                              ,
                     Y             
               u′ ∈        xα (ηα′ ) · Ud,3
                                        F
                                              where ηα′ ∈ Fq .
                             α∈Φ+
                             d(α)=2


Then we can also apply the above constructions to u′ . Thus, we obtain a corre-
sponding generalized Gelfand–Graev character Γu′ such that
                            F    
                      IndG            F      F 1/2
                          U F ϕu′ = [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] · Γu′ .
                                  d,2


Using the defining formula for Γu , it is straightforward to check that Γu = Γu′ if
u′ and u lie in the same PdF -orbit. (Indeed, if u′ = gug −1 where g ∈ PdF , then
ϕu′ (x) = ϕu (g −1 xg) for all x ∈ Ud,2
                                     F
                                         and so the induced characters are equal.)
Now let C be the G-conjugacy class of u. Then C F splits into orbits under the
finite group GF , and it is well-known that these GF -orbits are parametrized by
the F -conjugacy classes of CG (u)/CG (u)◦ . Since CG (u) ⊆ Pd , a complete set of
representatives for the GF -orbits in C F can be found inside C ∩ Ud,2
                                                                     F
                                                                       .

    Assume now that G is simple of adjoint type and write Π = {α1 , . . . , αl } where
l is the rank of G. Then we have X = ZΠ. Let {ω1 . . . , ωl } be the dual basis
of Y , that is, we have hαi , ωj i = δij for 1 6 i, j 6 l. Now we can state the
following result which generalizes the arguments in Ohmori [20], Lemma 2 and
Proposition 1(i). (See also Example 2.4 below.)

Proposition 2.3. Let G be simple of adjoint type and assume that there exist
integers nj ∈ Z (1 6 j 6 l) such that
        l
        X
              nj hα, ωj i = 1    for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d(α) = 2 and ηα 6= 0,
        j=1

where the coefficients ηα are defined as in Definition 2.1 (∗). Then the character
  F      F 1/2
[Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] · Γu can be realized over Q. If, moreover, we also have
                l
                X
                      nj hα, ωj i = 0   for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d(α) = 0,
                j=1

       F      F 1/2
then [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] · Γu′ can be realized over Q, for every u′ ∈ C ∩ Ud,2
                                                                      F

This is seen as follows. By [2], Proposition 3.1.2, the map
                                                                                 l
                                                                                 Y
               h : k × × · · · × k × → T,               (x1 , . . . , xl ) 7→          ωi (xi ),
                   |      {z       }
                        l factors                                                i=1

is an Fq -isomorphism. In particular, we have T F = {h(x1 , . . . , xl ) | xi ∈ F×   q }.
Now set t = h(ν n1 , . . . , ν nl ) ∈ T F . Let α ∈ Φ+ be such that d(α) = 2 and ηα =
                                                                                    6 0.
Then we have

                        j=1                  j=1

as required. Thus, (†) is proved.
                                                                            F
     Now let H := hti. Then H is a group of order q − 1 which normalizes Ud,2 . Let
                       F                              F
us induce ϕu from Ud,2 to the semidirect product Ud,2 .H and denote the induced
character by ψu . We will show that ψu is a rational-valued irreducible character.
                                                                   F
First note that ψu has non-zero values only on elements in Ud,2      . Furthermore,
                                                   F
                                                                     P
by Mackey’s formula, the restriction of ψu to Ud,2     is given by h∈H ϕhu where
ϕhu (x) = ϕu (hxh−1 ) for all x ∈ Ud,2
                                    F
                                       . Now let
                          Y
                                            F
                   x :=         xα (ξα ) ∈ Ud,2  for any ξα ∈ Fq .
                          α∈Φ+
                          d(α)>2


Then we have
                                    Y                            Y
                     txt−1 =                txα (ξα )t−1 =               xα (α(t)ξα )
                                   α∈Φ+                         α∈Φ+
                                   d(α)>2                       d(α)>2


and so, using (†),
                             X                          X         
              ϕtu (x) = χ                cα ηα α(t)ξα = χ ν  cα ηα ξα .
                               α∈Φ+                                      α∈Φ+
                               d(α)=2                                    d(α)=2


Similarly, for any 1 6 i 6 q − 1, we obtain
               i                                                      X
             ϕtu (x) = χ(ν i γx )           where           γx :=              cα ηα ξα ∈ Fq .
                                                                    α∈Φ+
                                                                    d(α)=2

                                                            i
This shows, first of all, that the characters ϕtu (1 6 i 6 q −1) are pairwise different
and, hence, the character ψu is seen to be irreducible. Furthermore, we obtain that
                              q−1           q−1              
               X              X      i      X                  q − 1 if γx = 0,
     ψu (x) =       ϕhu (x) =     ϕtu (x) =     χ(ν i γx ) =
                                                                −1    if γx 6= 0.
               h∈H                 i=1                i=1
                                                       F
In particular, this shows that ψu (x) ∈ Z for all x ∈ Ud,2 . Thus, ψu is a rational-
                                  F
valued irreducible character of Ud,2 .H. In order to show that ψu can be realized
over Q, we note that (again by Mackey’s formula), the restriction of ψu to H is the
                     Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters              7

character of the regular representation of H. Hence the trivial character 1H occurs
with multiplicity 1 in that restriction. By Frobenius reciprocity, ψu itself occurs
                                          F
with multiplicity 1 in the character of Ud,2 .H obtained by inducing 1H . Since the
latter character clearly is realized over Q, a standard argument on Schur indices
shows that ψu can be realized over Q (see Isaacs [11], Corollary 10.2). Finally, by
the transitivity of induction, the character
                               F     
                         IndG              F     F 1/2
                             U F ϕu = [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ]   · Γu
                                  d,2


can be realized over Q, as claimed.
   Now assume that the integers nj satisfy the additional equations described
above and consider an arbitrary element u′ ∈ C ∩ Ud,2
                                                  F
                                                      . Thus, we have u′ = gug −1
where g ∈ Pd . Let
                        Y              
                  u′ ∈         xα (ηα′ ) · Ud,3
                                            F
                                                where ηα′ ∈ Fq .
                          α∈Φ+
                          d(α)=2


We claim that if ηα′ 6= 0, then α = α1 + β where d(β) = 0, d(α1 ) = 2 and ηα1 6= 0.
To see this, it is enough to consider the special case where g ∈ T or where g ∈ Xβ
with d(β) > 0. The assertion is clear if g ∈ T . On the other hand, if g ∈ Xβ
where d(β) > 0, then Chevalley’s commutator relations show that gug −1 will lie
in a product of root subgroups Xiβ+α1 where d(α1 ) > 2 and i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and
the assertion also follows. We can now conclude that the integers nj automatically
have the property that
        l
        X
              nj hα, ωj i = 1 for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d(α) = 2 and ηα′ 6= 0.
        j=1

Thus, we can apply the above arguments to u′ as well and conclude that the
            F      F 1/2
character [Ud,1 : Ud,2 ] · Γu′ can be realized over Q.                   ⊓
                                                                         ⊔

Example 2.4. (Cf. Ohmori [20], p. 151.) Assume that G is simple of adjoint type.
The weighted Dynkin diagram corresponding to the conjugacy class of regular
unipotent elements in G is the map d0 : Φ → Z such that d0 (αi ) = 2 for all
1 6 i 6 l. In this case, we have
             Pd0 = B,      Ld0 = T      and      Ud0 ,1 = Ud0 ,2 = U ;
                 Q
furthermore, u = li=1 xαi (ηi ), where ηi ∈ F×
                                             q , is a representative in that class.
Now the system of equations in Proposition 2.3 is simply given by
                        l
                        X
                              nj hαi , ωj i = 1   for all 1 6 i 6 l.
                        j=1

Thus, we have nj = 1 for 1 6 j 6 l. Consequently, Γu (which is just an ordinary
Gelfand–Graev character) can be realized over Q.

Example 2.5. Assume that G is simple of adjoint type and that d is a weighted
Dynkin diagram of the following special type: There exists some i0 ∈ {1, . . . , l}
such that
              d(αi0 ) = 2     and d(αi ) = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , l} \ {i0 }.
We claim that, in this case, the generalized Gelfand–Graev character Γu can be
                                      F
realized over Q, for any u ∈ C ∩ Ud,2   . This is seen as follows. First note that
Ud,1 = Ud,2 . Now let ηα be defined as in Definition 2.1(∗) and consider the two
sets of equations in Proposition 2.3. The second set of equations reads
                  l
                  X
                        nj hαi , ωj i = 0   for all i ∈ {1, . . . , l} \ {i0 }.
                  j=1

This yields ni = 0 for all i 6= i0 . Then the first set of equations reads
         ni0 hα, ωi0 i = 1 for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d(α) = 2 and ηα 6= 0.
However, writing any such α as a linear combination of simple roots, we see that
αi0 always occurs with coefficient 1 and so the above equations hold with ni0 = 1.
Thus, the systems of equations in Proposition 2.3 have a unique solution.

   We close this section with a general remark concerning the Schur indices of
unipotent characters. This remark shows that it will be enough to consider the
unipotent characters of simple groups of adjoint type.

Remark 2.6. Assume that G is simple of adjoint type. Let G1 be an algebraic
group over Fq such that G1 /Z(G1 ) is simple of the same type as G. We denote
the Frobenius map on G1 again by F . Then we have a surjective homomorphism
of algebraic groups ϕ : G1 → G which is defined over Fq and such that ker(ϕ) =
Z(G1 ). Let χ be a unipotent character of GF . Denote by χ1 the character of
GF                                                   F
  1 which is obtained by first restricting χ to ϕ(G1 ) and then pulling back to G1
                                                                                   F

via ϕ. By [4], Proposition 7.10, the map χ 7→ χ1 defines a bijection between the
unipotent characters of GF and GF   1 , respectively. One can express this by saying
that the unipotent characters are “insensitive” to the center of G.
    For a unipotent character χ ∈ Irr(GF ), denote by Q(χ) = Q(χ(g) | g ∈ GF ) the
character field of χ and by mQ (χ) the Schur index of χ; we use similar notations
for a unipotent character of GF1 . We claim that

                   Q(χ) = Q(χ1 )            and       mQ (χ) = mQ (χ1 ).

Proof. First note that we clearly have Q(χ1 ) ⊆ Q(χ). To show that we have
equality, let E ⊇ Q be a finite Galois extension such that any unipotent character of
GF and of GF  1 can be realized over E. Given any τ ∈ Gal(E/Q) and any unipotent
character χ ∈ Irr(GF ), we denote by χτ the irreducible character obtained by
algebraic conjugation; it is still a unipotent character of GF (see the remarks in
[6], (5.1)). Now the map χ 7→ χ1 certainly is compatible with field automorphisms.
Thus, we have χτ1 = (χτ )1 . Since the map χ 7→ χ1 is a bijection, we conclude that
χτ1 = χ1 if and only if χτ = χ. This implies that Q(χ) = Q(χ1 ), as required.
                   Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters                        9

   Now consider the Schur indices. First note that we certainly have mQ (χ1 ) 6
mQ (χ). (Indeed, if χ can be realized over some extension field of Q, then χ1 is
automatically realized over the same field.) To show the reverse inequality, we
argue as follows. The character χ1 can be realized over an extension field E1 ⊇ Q
such that [E1 : Q] = mQ (χ1 ). We now regard χ1 as a character of ϕ(GF ). By
Frobenius reciprocity, χ occurs with multiplicity 1 in the character obtained by
inducing χ1 from ϕ(GF ) to GF . Since that induced character can also be realized
over E1 , a standard argument on Schur indices ([11], Corollary 10.2) shows that
mQ (χ) 6 mQ (χ1 ), as required.                                                 ⊓
                                                                                ⊔




         3. Simple groups of type G2 , F4 and E8
Throughout this section, let G be simple of (adjoint) type G2 , F4 or E8 , defined
over the finite field Fq with corresponding Frobenius map F : G → G. Then F is of
split type, in the sense of the previous section. The cuspidal unipotent characters
of GF and the previously known results on their Schur indices are listed in Table 1.

(notation of Carter [2], §13.9; see also [6], Table 1)

                i := −1, θ := exp(2πi/3), ζ := exp(2πi/5).


   Now let us assume that G is defined over a field of good characteristic. All
the cuspidal unipotent characters of GF have the same “unipotent support” in
the sense of Lusztig [15]; see also [8], Proposition 4.2. Hence there is a unique
unipotent class C0 in G such that all the cuspidal unipotent characters of GF have
unipotent support C0 . Let e0 = dim Bu (the dimension of the variety of Borel
subgroups containing an element u ∈ C0 ). Then, by [8], Theorem 3.7, q e0 is the
10                                            Geck


exact power of q dividing the degreess of the unipotent characters of GF having
unipotent support C0 . By inspection of the tables in [2], Chapter 9, we find that
e0 = 1, 4 or 16 for G of type G2 , F4 or E8 , respectively. Furthermore, for G of type
G2 or F4 , the class C0 is uniquely determined by this condition. In type E8 , we use
the additional information that CG (u)/CG (u)◦ must be non-trivial (see once more
the formula in [8], Theorem 3.7). Then C0 is uniquely determined. The weighted
Dynkin diagram d0 associated to C0 is specified in Table 2. Furthermore, we have
CG (u)/CG (u)◦ ∼ = S3 , S4 or S5 for G of type G2 , F4 or E8 , respectively.

    Now let us fix a cuspidal unipotent character ρ of GF . By Lusztig, [15], The-
orem 11.2, there exists some u ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 such that ρ occurs with “small” mul-
tiplicity in Γu . In the present situation, Kawanaka actually obtained an explicit
multiplicity formula. To state that formula, we need to recall some facts about
the parametrization of unipotent characters; see Lusztig [13], Main Theorem 4.23.
    Let F0 be the unique family of unipotent characters which contains the cuspidal
unipotent characters. Let G0 be the finite group attached to that family; we have
G0 ∼
   = CG (u)/CG (u)◦ in the present situation. Let M0 be the set of all pairs (x, σ)
where x ∈ G0 (up to conjugacy) and σ ∈ Irr(CG0 (x)). Then we have a bijection
                           M0 → F0 ,           (x, σ) 7→ ρ(x,σ) .
(which satisfies some further conditions which we do not need to recall here). On
the other hand, there is a well-defined “split” element u0 ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 ; see Shoji
[23], Remark 5.1. Having fixed that element, there is a canonical parametrization
of the GF -conjugacy classes contained in C0F by the conjugacy classes of G0 . We
shall denote by Γuy the generalized Gelfand–Graev character with respect to a
unipotent element uy ∈ C0 ∩UdF0 ,2 in the GF -class parametrized by y ∈ G0 . Having
fixed this notation, we can now state the following result.


Theorem 3.1 (Kawanaka). Recall that G is a group of type G2 , F4 or E8 in
good characteristic. Let hρ(x,σ) , Γuy i be the multiplicity of ρ(x,σ) in the generalized
                    Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters                    11

Gelfand–Graev character Γuy , where x, y ∈ G0 and σ ∈ Irr(CG0 (x)). Then we have
                                 
                                   σ(1)    if x = y (mod G0 ),
               hρ(x,σ) , Γuy i =
                                    0      otherwise.

Proof. Kawanaka obtained an explicit formula for the values of all the generalized
Gelfand–Graev characters of GF ; see [12], Corollary 3.2.7 and Lemma 3.3.10. Fur-
thermore, in [12], §4.2, he obtained explicit formulas for the values of the unipotent
characters on unipotent elements. (In the latter reference, it is actually assumed
that the characteristic is large. But this hypothesis is only used in reference to
results on the Green functions of GF , which are now known to hold in general;
see Shoji [24], Theorem 5.5.) The above multiplicity formula is obtained by a sim-
ple formal rewriting of Kawanaka’s formulas. In large characteristic, that formula
could also be deduced from Lusztig’s more general results in [15].                  ⊓
                                                                                    ⊔

Corollary 3.2. Recall that G is a group of type G2 , F4 or E8 in good character-
istic. Then every cuspidal unipotent character of GF has Schur index 1.

Proof. By inspection of the tables in [2], §13.9, all cuspidal unipotent characters
of GF are labelled by pairs (x, σ) ∈ M0 where σ(1) = 1. Thus, by Theorem 3.1,
every such character occurs with multiplicity 1 in some generalized Gelfand–Graev
character attached to an element in C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 . Now we notice that the weighted
Dynkin diagrams in Table 2 are of the type considered in Example 2.5. Thus,
all the generalized Gelfand–Graev characters associated with unipotent elements
in C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 can be realized over Q. Hence, the assertion follows by a standard
argument on Schur indices (see Isaacs [11], Corollary 10.2).                     ⊓
                                                                                 ⊔

    The above result also covers some of the cases (at least in good characteristic)
already dealt with by Lusztig [17] or the author [6]. In combination with the
previously known results listed in Table 1, we see that there is only one case left
that remains to be considered:

         the characters E8 [±i] for a group of type E8 in characteristic 5.

We shall now outline a strategy for dealing with this case. That strategy is anal-
ogous to that in [6], (6.5). For the remainder of this section, let G be a simple
group of type E8 over Fq where q is odd and p ≡ 1 mod 4. Let us label the simple
roots of G as in Table 2 and let {ω1 , . . . , ω8 } be the dual basis of Y . Then we have
T = {h(x1 , . . . , x8 ) | xi ∈ k × } as in the proof of Proposition 2.3. Now let ν be a
generator of the multiplicative group of Fq and consider the semisimple element
                       s := h(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ν (q−1)/4, 1, 1) ∈ T F .
Thus, s is an element of order 4. Its centralizer is given by G1 = hT, Xα | α ∈ Φ1 i
where Φ1 = {α ∈ Φ | α(s) = 1}. It is readily checked that a system of simple roots
of Φ1 is given by Π1 = (Π \ {α6 }) ∪ {−α0 }, where
              α0 = 2α1 + 3α2 + 4α3 + 6α4 + 5α5 + 4α6 + 3α7 + 2α8
12                                               Geck


is the unique highest root in Φ. The root system Φ1 is of type D5 × A3 . Now,
by Lusztig [14], Proposition 21.3, there is a well-defined unipotent class C1 ⊆ G1
which supports a “cuspidal local system”. That unipotent class is determined ex-
plicitly by [18], Corollary 4.9, as far as the D5 -factor is concerned. (We necessarily
have the class of regular unipotent elements in the A3 -factor; see [14], §18.) Using
[2], §13.9, we see that the weighted Dynkin diagram d1 of C1 is given as follows:

                  2         2             0          2              2          2     2

                                     2    ✇ α2

By [1], Theorem 11.3.2, we can explicitly identify an adjoint group of type D5
with a 10-dimensional orthogonal group. Determining the Jordan normal form of
the matrix corresponding to the element
        u1 := xα1 (1)xα5 (1)xα2 (1)xα3 +α4 (1)xα4 +α5 (1) · xα7 (1)xα8 (1)x−α0 (1),
we see that u1 ∈ C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 . Now, we have CG1 (u1 )/CG   ◦         ∼ Z/4Z; see [6],
                                                                (u1 ) =
                                                              1
Table 2, and the references there. Let ψ be one of the two faithful irreducible
characters of this group and define Γ(C1 ,ψ) as in [15], (7.5). Thus, Γ(C1 ,ψ) is a
certain linear combination (where the coefficients involve the values of ψ) of the
generalized Gelfand–Graev characters of GF  1 associated with the various unipotent
elements in C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 . Now we can state the following result.

Proposition 3.3. In the above setting, assume that the following conditions hold:

 (a) The values of Γ(C1 ,ψ) are given by Lusztig’s formula [15], Corollary 7.6.
     (This is known to be true if the characteristic is “large”.)

 (b) The assertion in [16], Theorem 0.8, holds for cuspidal character sheaves in G.
     (This is known to be true if the characteristic is good; see [24], Theorem 4.1.)

Then the Schur index of the cuspidal unipotent character E8 [±i] is 1.

Proof. We begin by showing that the generalized Gelfand–Graev characters of GF        1
which are associated with the unipotent elements in C1 ∩UdF1 ,2 can be realized over
Q. For this purpose, we use an argument analogous to that in Proposition 2.3.
    We shall consider a system of equations as in Proposition 2.3 (but with respect
to the unipotent element u1 ∈ G1 specified above):
     8               
    X                  1 for α ∈ {α1 , α5 , α2 , α3 + α4 , α4 + α5 , α7 , α8 , −α0 },
       nj hα, ωj i =
                       0 for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d1 (α) = 0.
     j=1

One readily checks that this system has a unique solution:
                        (n1 , n2 , . . . , n8 ) = (1, 1, 1, 0, 1, −5, 1, 1).
                    Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters                          13

Thus, t := h(ν, ν, ν, 1, ν, ν −5, ν, ν) ∈ T F is a semisimple element of order q − 1.
    Now let u ∈ C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 . Then, as in the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that
α(t) = ν (if α is involved in the expresssion of u as a poduct of root subgroup
elements) or α(t) = 1 (if d1 (α) = 0). Let H = hti and denote by ψu the character
obtained by inducing ϕu from UdF1 ,2 to UdF1 ,2 .H. Following exactly the same kind
of arguments as in the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that ψu is an irreducible
character which can actually be realized over Q. Consequently, the generalized
Gelfand–Graev character Γu of GF        1 can also be realized over Q, as claimed.
    We now follow the line of argument in [6], (6.5). First note that the character
values of E8 [±i] generate the field Q(i); see [6], Table 1. Thus, we must show that
E8 [±i] can be realized over Q(i). Let Σ be the G-conjugacy class of su1 . Then
Σ supports a “cuspidal local system” E; see [6], Table 2 and the references there.
Using [13], Main Theorem 4.23, the explicit description of the Fourier matrix for
type E8 , and our assumption (b), we see that

                                              1
                   hE8 [±i], χ(Σ,E) i =         ε        where ε ∈ C, |ε| = 1;
                                              4

here, χ(Σ,E) is a characteristic function of (Σ, E) and h , i denotes the usual
hermitian product on the space of complex-valued class functions on GF . On
the other hand, since CG1 (u1 )/CG ◦

                                       (u1 ) ∼
                                             = Z/4Z, the set C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 splits into
four classes in G1 , with representatives u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 ∈ C1 ∩ UdF1 ,2 say. Then, our
                 F

assumption (a) implies that we have

where Z1 := Z(G1 ) = hsi and ξr,λ ∈ Z[i]; see the analogous equation in [6], (6.5),
and note that Z(G1 )◦ = {1}. Now, since Z1 ∩ H = {1}, it is easily shown that

                                                      P
can be realized over Q(i). Thus, we have 4 χ(Σ,E) = α rα ρα where rα ∈ Z[i] and
ρα are characters of GF which can be realized over Q(i). Since hE8 [±i], 4χ(Σ,E) i =
ε has absolute value 1, we conclude that the greatest common divisor of the mul-
tiplicities hE8 [±i], ρα i must be 1. Hence, a standard argument on Schur indices
([11], Corollary 10.2) implies that E8 [±i] can be realized over Q(i), as desired. ⊓
                                                                                   ⊔




   In principal, the hypothesis on Γ(C1 ,ψ) can be verified by an explicit computa-
tion for a group of type D5 × A3 (in the same way as Kawanaka [12] verified that
hypothesis for groups of exceptional type). The details will be discussed in [10].

                     4. Simple groups of type E7
Let G be a simple group of adjoint type E7 in good characteristic. There are
precisely
√          two cuspidal unipotent characters of GF denoted by E7 [±ξ] where ξ =
  −q; see the table in [2], §13.9. By [6], Table 1, the character values of E7 [±ξ] lie
in the field Q(ξ) and the Schur index of E7 [±ξ] is 1, 2 or 4. Furthermore, by [6],
Example 6.4, we already know that the Schur index is 1 if p 6≡ 1 mod 4 or if q is
not a square, where p is the characteristic of Fq . Thus, the remaining task is to
determine the Schur index when q is a square and p ≡ 1 mod 4.
    Let C0 be the common unipotent support of the two cuspidal unipotent char-
acters. Arguing as in the previous section (that is, checking the exact power of q
dividing the degree of E7 [±ξ] and comparing with the tables in [2], Chapter 9),
we find that the corresponding weighted Dynkin diagram d0 is given as follows.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that q is an even power of p. Let u ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 and recall
the definition of the linear character ϕu from Section 2. Then there exists a field
                                        F      
K ⊇ Q such that [K : Q] 6 2 and IndG   UF    ϕu can be realized over K.
                                                 d0 ,2


Proof. The following argument is inspired by Ohmori [20], Proposition 1.
   By Mizuno [19], Lemma 28, a representative u0 ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 is given by
                          u0 = x20 (1)x21 (1)x24 (1)x28 (1)x30 (1),
where the subscripts correspond to the following roots in Φ+ :
            20 : α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 ,                      21 : α1 + α3 + α4 + α5 ,
            24 : α2 + α4 + α5 + α6 ,                      28 : α2 + α3 + 2α4 + α5 ,
            30 : α3 + α4 + α5 + α6 + α7 .
We consider a set of equations similar to that in Proposition 2.3:
      7                
     X                   2 for α ∈ Φ+ labelled by 20, 21, 24, 28 and 30,

                         0 for all α ∈ Φ+ such that d0 (α) = 0.
      j=1

One readily checks that this system has a unique solution:
                            (n1 , n2 , . . . , n7 ) = (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0).
Now let ν be a generator of the multiplicative group of Fp ⊆ Fq . Since q is an even
power of p, we can find a square root of ν in Fq , which we denote by ν 1/2 ∈ Fq .
Then the element
            t := h(ν n1 /2 , . . . , ν n7 /2 ) = h(ν 1/2 , 1, 1, ν 1/2 , 1, ν 1/2 , 1) ∈ T F
                   Schur indices of cuspidal unipotent characters                 15

has order 2(p − 1) and, as in the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that α(t) = ν for
all α ∈ Φ+ such that d0 (α) = 2 and ηα 6= 0 where the coefficients ηα are defined as
in Definition 2.1(∗) (with respect to the unipotent element u ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 ). Now
let H = hti. Then H is a group of order 2(p − 1) which normalizes UdF0 ,2 . Let us
induce ϕu from UdF0 ,2 to the semidirect product UdF0 ,2 .H and denote the induced
character by ψu . Arguing as in the proof of Ohmori [20], Proposition 1(ii), we
see that ψu is the sum of two rational-valued irreducible characters ψ1 and ψ2 ,
where one of them, ψ1 say, can be realized over Q. By the Brauer–Speiser theorem
(see [3], 74.27), the character ψ2 has Schur index at most 2. Thus, there exists
a field K ⊇ Q such that [K : Q] 6 2 and ψ = ψ1 + ψ2 can be realized over K.
Consequently, by the transitivity of induction, the character

can also be realized over K.                                                       ⊓
                                                                                   ⊔

Remark 4.2. We have remarked at the beginning of this section that it is enough
to compute the Schur index of E7 [±ξ] in the case where q is a square     √ and p ≡
1 mod 4. In this case, the character values of E7 [±ξ] lie in the field Q( −1).
    Now Ohmori [20], p. 154, points out that the character ψ2 arising in the above
proof has non-trivial local√Schur indices at ∞ and at the prime p. This implies
                                                                              √ that
K is not contained in Q( −1) if p√≡ 1 mod 4. Indeed, if we had K ⊆ Q( √−1),
then ψ2 could be realized over Q( −1). Since p ≡ 1 mod 4, the field Q( −1)
is contained in the field of p-adic numbers. Hence, ψ2 could be realized over the
latter field, contradicting the fact that the local Schur index at p is not one.

Corollary 4.3. Recall that G is a group of type E7 in good characteristic. Then
the two cuspidal unipotent characters of GF have Schur index at most 2.

Proof. We have already remarked at the beginning of this section that the Schur
index of E7 [±ξ] is 1 if q is not a square. So let us now assume that q is an even
power of p. Let u0 ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 . Then it is known that CG (u0 )/CG (u0 )◦ ∼= Z/2Z
(see the tables in [2], §13.1). Thus, C0F splits into two classes in the finite group
GF . Let u1 ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 be a representative of the second GF -conjugacy class
contained in C0F . Combining [8], Theorem 3.7 and Remark 3.8, we have that
                        hE7 [±ξ], Γu0 i + hE7 [±ξ], Γu1 i = 1.
(This could also be deduced from Kawanaka’s explicit multiplicity formulas [12].)
Thus, E7 [±ξ] occurs with multiplicity 1 in Γu for some u ∈ C0 ∩ UdF0 ,2 . Conse-
quently, we have
                D               F
                                     E
                  E7 [±ξ], IndG
                              UF  ϕu    = [UdF0 ,1 : UdF0 ,2 ]1/2 =: m0 ,
                               d0 ,2


where the number m0 on the right hand side is odd since we are in good character-
istic. Let K ⊇ Q be as in Lemma 4.1. Then a standard result on Schur indices (see
Isaacs [11], Lemma 10.4) shows that the Schur index of E7 [±ξ] divides [K : Q] m0 .

However, as we have already remarked at the beginning of this section, the Schur
index of E7 [±ξ] must be 1, 2 or 4. Thus, since m0 is odd, we can now conclude
that the Schur index of E7 [±ξ] divides [K : Q] 6 2.                          ⊓
                                                                              ⊔

Remark 4.4. The Schur index of E7 [±ξ] equals 1 or 2, according to whether
                D                       E
                              GF
                  E7 [±ξ], IndU F .H ψ1    is odd or even,
                                       d0 ,2


where ψ1 is defined in the proof of Lemma 4.1. Thus, the problem is reduced to
the computation of the above scalar product, and this will be discussed in [7].
