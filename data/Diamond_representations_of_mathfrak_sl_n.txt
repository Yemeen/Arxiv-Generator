                                             Abstract

                                                In [W], there is a graphic description of any irreducible, finite dimen-
                                             sional sl(3) module. This construction, called diamond representation
                                             is very simple and can be easily extended to the space of irreducible
                                             finite dimensional Uq (sl(3))-modules.

                                                In the present work, we generalize this construction to sl(n). We
                                             show this is in fact a description of the reduced shape algebra, a quo-
                                             tient of the shape algebra of sl(n). The basis used in [W] is thus nat-
                                             urally parametrized with the so called quasi standard Young tableaux.
                                             To compute the matrix coefficients of the representation in this basis,
                                             it is possible to use Groebner basis for the ideal of reduced Plücker
                                             relations defining the reduced shape algebra.


                                                                           1. Introduction

                                               In this paper, we consider the irreducible finite dimensional repre-
                                             sentations of the Lie algebra sl(n) = sl(n, C). Of course these repre-
                                             sentations are well known and there are very explicit descriptions for
                                             them, for instance in [FH].

                                                First, sl(n) acts naturally on Cn , its fundamental representations are
                                             the natural actions on Cn , ∧2 Cn , . . . , ∧n−1 Cn , they have highest weights
                                             ω1 , . . . , ωn−1 . Each simple sl(n)-module has a highest weight λ and this
                                             highest weight characterizes the module. Note Sλ this module, it is a
                                             submodule of the tensor product
                                                      Syma1 (Cn ) ⊗ Syma2 (∧2 Cn ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Syman−1 (∧n−1 Cn ),
                                             if λ = a1 ω1 + · · · + an−1 ωn−1 .

   The direct sum S• of all the simple modules has a natural realization
                                                                  +
as the shape algebra of sl(n), i.e. as the algebra C[SL(n)]N of polyno-
mial functions on the group SL(n), which are invariant under the right
multiplication by upper triangular matrices. Let g be an element in
                 (s)
SL(n), denote δi1 ,...,is (g) the determinant of the submatrix of g obtained
by considering the s first columns of g and the rows i1 < · · · < is , then
                                                       (s)
S• is generated as an algebra by the functions δi1 ,...,is . More precisely, it
                          (s)
is the quotient of C[δi1 ,...,is ] by the ideal P (δ) generated by the Plücker
relations.

   Generally a parametrization of a basis for Sλ is given by the set of
semi-standard Young tableaux T of shape λ i.e. with an−1 columns of
size n − 1, . . . , a1 columns of size 1.

    Using this description, we give here a natural ordering on the set
               (s)
of variables δi1 ,...,is , we determine the Groebner basis of P (δ) for this
ordering, getting the corresponding basis of the quotient as monomials
δ T , for T semi-standard.

  Thus the action of upper triangular matrices on this basis can be
easily computed. (See for instance the description given in [LT]).

   On the other hand, in [W], N. Wildberger gave a really different pre-
sentation of the simple sl(3)-modules. This description is based on the
construction of the diamond cone for sl(3), it is an infinite dimensional
indecomposable module for the Heisenberg Lie algebra with a very ex-
plicit basis. The matrix coefficients are integral numbers and fixing the
highest weight λ, it is easy to build the corresponding representation of
sl(3), on the submodule generated by this vector in the diamond cone.

  In this paper, we extend this presentation to sl(n). In fact the di-
amond cone module is a quotient of the shape algebra. We call this
                                                              (s)
quotient the reduced shape algebra. It is the quotient of C[δi1 ,...,is ] by
the ideal Pred (δ) sum of the ideal of Plücker relations and the ideal
                (s)
generated by δ1,...,s − 1.

   With the same approach as above, we define a new ordering on the
            (s)
variables δi1 ,...,is , with this ordering, we can compute the Groebner ba-
sis for Pred(δ) and the corresponding basis for the quotient : the set of
monomials δ T , for some Young tableaux T called here quasi-standard.

The action of the upper triangular matrices on this basis is easy to
compute : this gives us the diamond cone for sl(n).

  In order to refind the complete sl(n)-modules, we have to define a
symmetry on each Sλ and on the corresponding submodule in the re-
duced shape algebra. This symmetry exchanges the role of N + and
N − and we get the complete sl(n) representation.

  Unfortunately, this symmetry corresponds to a modification of the
ordering on Young tableaux, thus, if n > 3 to a different basis in Sλ .
The n− action on the first base is not so simple as in [W].




   2. Usual (algebraic) presentation of the sl(n) simple
                          modules

  Let us consider the Lie algebra sl(n) = sl(n, C): it is the set of n × n
traceless matrices, it is the Lie algebra of the Lie group SL(n) of n × n
matrices, with determinant 1. The Cartan algebra h is the space of
diagonal matrices:
                                                                       
          θ1      0                                                      
     h= H=   ..      ,              θj ∈ C,       θ1 + · · · + θn = 0       .
                 .
                                                                         
            0      θn

  We put αi (H) = θi . The root system of sl(n) is the set of linear form
on h generated by the αi − αj , (i 6= j).
  The usual basis ∆ for the root system is given by :

                 ∆ = {αi − αi+1 , i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1}

The root space corresponding to the simple root ηi = αi − αi+1 is
generated by the upper triangular matrix:
                                                   
                                  0
                                       1           
                       Xη = 
                                      ..           .
                                                    
                                            .
                                                0
4             D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

The root space corresponding to −η is generated by lower triangular
matrix:
                                       
                         0
                              ..       
                  Yη =           .      = t Xη
                           1           
                                                      0
these matrices generate sl(n) as a Lie algebra.

 A weight λ for sl(n) is a linear form :
              
   θ1       0
λ:    ..      →7 (a1 +· · ·+an−1 )θ1 +(a2 +· · ·+an−1 )θ2 +· · ·+an−1 θn−1 .
          .
    0       θn
If a1 , . . . , an−1 are positive integral numbers, we shall say that λ is a
dominant integral weight. This is the case if and only if λ is a linear
                        P
                        n−1
combination λ =             aj ωj , with positive integral coefficients aj , of the
                     j=1
fundamental weights:
                                             
                           θ1            0
ωj = α1 + · · · + αj :         ..             7→ θ1 + · · · + θj   (1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1).
                                     .
                           0             θn

  The set of simple sl(n)-modules up to equivalence is isomorphic to
the set of dominant integral weights. More precisely, sl(n) acts nat-
urally on V = Cn (with canonical basis e1 , . . . , en ), thus also on the
totally antisymmetric tensor products ∧j V (j = 1, . . . , n − 1) and on
the symmetric tensor products Symaj (∧j V ) and finally on
        Syma1 (V ) ⊗ Syma2 (∧2 V ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Syman−1 (∧n−1 V ).
                                             P
  For each dominant integral weight λ =        aj ωj , the corresponding
               λ
simple module S (V ) is the submodule of
          Syma1 (V ) ⊗ Syma2 (∧2 V ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Syman−1 (∧n−1 V ).
generated by the vector:
          v λ = (e1 )a1 ⊗ (e1 ∧ e2 )a2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en−1 )an−1 .
  With this construction, we get each simple sl(n)-module, and two
distinct weights λ, λ′ give rise to inequivalent simple sl(n)-modules.

  This action gives rise by exponentiation to a representation of SL(n).
Let us put                                       
                                  0           εn
                                          .      
                                                 
                          Ω=          .         
                                                  
                                     .           
                                 εn            0

where εn = 1 if 2 is even and εn = e n if n2 is odd. Then Ω
belongs to SL(n). In fact, this matrix, acting by adjoint action gen-
erates the longest element of the Weyl group of SL(n). It corresp-
nds to a change in the choice of simple roots and nilpotent subalge-
bras n+ and  n− , if X =  [xij ] is a strictly upper triangular matrix,
Ω−1 XΩ = x(n+1−i)(n+1−j) is strictly lower triangular. Let us put:
   λ
  v− = (en )a1 ⊗ (en ∧ en−1 )a2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (en ∧ · · · ∧ e2 )an−1 = ε−|λ| λ
                                                                    n Ω.v ,
                                                  λ
with |λ| = a1 + 2a2 + · · · + (n − 1)an−1 . Then v− is a lowest weight
           λ
vector in S (V ).


 3. The shape algebra: abstract algebraic presentation

  Let us put:                             M
                              S• (V ) =         Sλ (V ).
                                           λ
Since we have an explicit realization of each highest weight vector, it
is possible to define a natural comultiplication ∆ on S• (V ), just by
defining                         M
                 ∆ : Sλ (V ) −→        Sµ (V ) ⊗ Sν (V )
                                      µ+ν=λ

as the unique sl(n)-morphism sending v λ on
                                 X
                       ∆(v λ ) =     vµ ⊗ vν .
                                        µ+ν=λ

∆ is cocommutative. The contragredient
                              P            module
                                               P  (Sλ )∗ is naturally
                 tλ
identified with S where t λ =   an−i ωi if λ =   ai ωi . By transposi-
tion, ∆ defines a commutative multiplication m on S• (V ):
                               t          t                t   t
               m = t ∆ : S µ (V ) ⊗ S ν (V ) −→ S µ+ ν (V ).
                     P               P
By definition, if µ = j bj ωj , ν = j cj ωj ,
m(v µ ⊗ v ν ) = v µ .v ν = v µ+ν = eb11 +c1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en−1 )bn−1 +cn−1 .
6              D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

  Since each isotypic component of the SL(n) module S• (V ) is simple
the multiplication m is characterized by this relation and the condition
                         m (Sµ (V ) ⊗ Sν (V )) ⊂ Sµ+ν (V ).

  We shall call shape algebra of SL(n) the algebra S• (V ) equipped
with the above multiplication.


  By construction the shape algebra is generated as an algebra by the
subspace V ⊕ ∧2 V ⊕ · · · ⊕ ∧n−1 V . Thus it is a quotient of the algebra
denoted in [FH]:
                                                     
       A• (V ) = Sym• V ⊕ ∧2 V ⊕ · · · ⊕ ∧n−1 V
                   M
               =           Syman−1 (∧n−1 V ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Syma1 (V ).
                      a1 ,...,an−1

  We define now the ideal of Plücker relations: it is the ideal P of
A (V ) generated by the vectors in Sym2 (∧p V ):
    •

(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eip ).(ej1 ∧ · · · ∧ ejp )+
                          p
                        X
                      +     (−1)ℓ (ej1 ∧ ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ ec
                                                        iℓ ∧ · · · ∧ eip ).(eiℓ ∧ ej2 ∧ · · · ∧ ejp )
                       ℓ=1

and by the vectors in ∧p V ⊗ ∧q V (p > q)
(ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eip ).(ej1 ∧ · · · ∧ ejq )+
                          p
                        X
                      +     (−1)ℓ (ej1 ∧ ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ ec
                                                        iℓ ∧ · · · ∧ eip ).(eiℓ ∧ ej2 ∧ · · · ∧ ejq ).
                       ℓ=1


Theorem 1.
 The shape algebra S• (V ) is the quotient of A• (V ) by the ideal P .
  This theorem is well known. There is a complete proof in [FH] p.
235, this result is cited by Towber in [LT] as a theorem due to Kostant.

    We define a symmetry τ in S• just by putting:
                              τ (v) = Ω.v if v ∈ S• (V )
Since the multiplication is a morphism of sl(n) and SL(n) module,

above by fixing v−        .v− = v− .

  Now for each matrix A in sl(n), ΩAΩ = τ A is the matrix defined by

        4. The shape algebra: geometric presentation

   The shape algebra can also be viewed as an algebra of functions on a
quotient SL(n)/N + of the Lie group SL(n). Denote N + the subgroup
                               

  Let us consider the space C[SL(n)] = C[gij ]/(det − 1) of all polyno-
mial functions f with respect to the entries gij of the matrix g ∈ SL(n).
There is a SL(n) × SL(n) action on this space, defined as follows:

                         ((g1 , g2 ).f )(g ′) = f (t g1 g ′ g2 ).

   Since this space is generated by the invariant finite dimensional sub-
spaces of class of functions with degree less than N (N = 0, 1 . . . ),
this action is completely reducible in a sum of finite dimensional sim-
ple SL(n) × SL(n) modules. The highest vector for these modules are
class of functions f such that:

                 f (t n+   +            +    +   +    +
                       1 gn2 ) = f (g) n1 ∈ N , n2 ∈ N .


But, let us consider the restriction of f to the dense set of g such that,
                       (s)
for s = 1, . . . , n, δ1,2,...,s (g) 6= 0. On this set, using the Gauss method,

Acting with only the first factor SL(n) on these functions, we get all
the polynomial N + right invariant functions on SL(n). Due to the
form of the bi-invariant functions f , these functions are polynomial
functions in the δ-variables :
                                       +               (s)
                        C[SL(n)]N ≃ C[δi1 ,...,is ]/P (δ),
where P (δ) is an ideal. Moreover each irreducible representation of
SL(n) happens exactly one times in this space, thus as a vector space,
                                                                    +
                               S• (Cn ) ≃ C[SL(n)]N .

  Acting on δ λ (λ =    i ai ωi ) on the left by N   = t (N + ), we get
polynomial functions which contains only monomials of the form:
                                    n−1
                                    YY  as
                                                 (s)

                                    s=1 k=1

Let us call V a1 ,...,an−1 the space of such functions. In view of our de-
scription, it is a simple module and the isotypic component of type λ
               +
in C[SL(n)]N .

  Finally the usual pointwise multiplication of polynomial functions
send V a1 ,...,an−1 ⊗ V b1 ,...,bn−1 into V (a1 +b1 ),...,(an−1 +bn−1 ) . Thus the above
identification

characterized by v λ 7→ δ λ is a morphism of algebra.
Proposition 1.
   The shape algebra is isomorphic to the algebra O(SL(n)/N + ) of the
regular functions on the homogeneous space SL(n)/N + .
   The ideal P (δ) is the ideal generated by the Plücker relations written
on the δ functions.


Remark 1.
   In this presentation of S• (Cn ), the SL(n) action on the elements of
the shape algebra, viewed as a polynomial function f is very natural
since it is just:
                (g.f )(g ′) = f (t gg ′), g ∈ SL(n), g ′ ∈ SL(n).

                                                                                       +
  The symmetry τ can be directly implemented in the space C[SL(n)]N .
Indeed τ is up to conjugation by Ω, a morphism of SL(n) modules and
the formula
                 τ (e1 ∧ · · · ∧ es ) = εsn en ∧ · · · ∧ en+1−s
becomes here
                            (s)               (s)
                        τ (δ1,2,...,s ) = εsn δn,(n−1),...,(n+1−s) .
But, if we put for any regular function f on SL(n), (θf )(g) = f (Ωg),
                                      +
we define a bijection from C[SL(n)]N into itself such that
                                                     (s)          (s)
          g.θ(f ) = θ(Ω−1 gΩ.f ) and θ(δ1,...,s ) = δn,n−1,...,n+1−s .
Thus τ = θ.



     5. The shape algebra : Combinatorial presentation

  The usual basis of S λ (V ) are parameterized by the semi standard
Young tableaux with shape λ. Let us be more precize:
10                D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

     We can naturally associate to each δ variable a column C:
                                                             i1
                                             (p)             i2
                                   δ C = δi1 ,...,ip      −→ ..
                                                              .
                                                                ip
Then if we identify two Young tableaux which differ only by a permu-
tation of their columns, the set of Young tableaux defines a linear basis
                    (s)
for the algebra C[δi1 ,...,is ]:

                                                                     ...
                                                                     ..

                                                                      .
             δ T = δi1 ,...,i

                                                                −→   ...
                                                           k




(p1 ≤ p2 ≤ · · · ≤ pk ). That means, we read the Young tableau from
right to left, using the following convention: if two different columns C
and C ′ have the same height, we put in the first place in T the column
C if
             ip = i′p , ip−1 = i′p−1 , . . . , ir+1 = i′r+1 , and ir < i′r .
  The Plücker relations are quadratic in the δ variables, they corre-
spond to linear combination of Young tableaux with two columns, for
instance, we get for sl(3) the following relation between tableaux:
        (2) (1)      (2) (1)       (2) (1)                1 3        2 1       1 2
       δ12 δ3 − δ23 δ1 + δ13 δ2 −→                               −         +
                                                          2          3         3
In order to describe a basis for the quotient space:
                                                   (j)
                               S• (V ) = C[δi1 ,...,ij ]/ P (δ) ,

we will use the notion of Groebner basis [CLO].

   Let us consider the algebra C[X1 , . . . , Xk ] of polynomials in the vari-
able Xi and an ideal I of C[X1 , . . . , Xk ].
   Suppose we fix an ordering on the set of monomials X1α1 . . . Xkαk
in C[X1 , . . . , Xk ] (for instance by using the lexicographie ordering on
words α1 . . . αk if we put X1 < X2 < · · · < Xk ). Then any polynomial
g has an unique leading term LT (g); the greatest monomial happening
in g for this ordering.

Definition 1.
   A finite subset {g1, . . . , gk } of an ideal I is said to be a reduced Groeb-
ner basis for I if and only if the leading term of any element of I is
divisible by one of the leading term of gi and if for all gi no monomial
of gi is divisible by the leading term of some gj j 6= i.


   If {g1 , . . . , gk } is a reduced Groebner basis for I, then the set of
(classes of) monomials which are not divisible by any monomials LT (gi)
(i = 1, . . . , k) is a basis of the quotient C[X1 , . . . , Xk ]/I.

   Following [FH], we know there is in the ideal P (δ) the following
elements for any p ≥ q ≥ r:

                                  X   (p)                              (p)

                                                                                            (∗)
          (p)
where    δ({i1 ,...,ip }\A)∪{j1 ,...,jr }
                                       = 0 if there is a repetition of some index
and, if {k1 , . . . , kp } = ({i1 , . . . , ip } \ A) ∪ {j1 , . . . , jr } and k1 < · · · < kp ,
then
                            (p)                                (p)
                           δ({i1 ,...,ip }\A)∪{j1 ,...,jr } = δk1 ,...,kp .

   We put the lexicographic ordering on the monomials δ T in C[δi1 ,...,ip ].


Remark 2.
  In [FH], an ordering < on Young tableaux is defined,in fact our or-
dering is the reverse ordering since:
                                            ′
                              δ T < δ T if and only if T ′ < T.


   Recall that a Young tableau is semi standard if its entries are in-
creasing along each row (and strictly increasing along each column). It
is well known that the set of semi standard Young tableau gives a basis
        (p)
for C[δi1 ,...,ip ]/P (δ) (see [FH] for instance).

  Our ordering defines an unique Groebner basis for P (δ). We shall
now build this basis.
  For any non semi standard Young tableau T with 2 columns, there
exists an element in P (δ) of the form (∗). This relation can be written
as:                        n
                         X
                     T
                    δ +       ±δ Tj with δ Tj < δ T ∀j.
                          j=1
Each Tj has the same shape as T but some of them can be non semi
standard. We repeat the construction for each non semi standard Tj
and finally we get, for each non semi standard T with 2 columns, an
element fT in P (δ) such that the leading term of fT is δ T and all
                                         ′
the monomials of fT have the form a.δ T with T ′ semi standard and
   ′
δT < δT .
Theorem 2.
 The set
             G = {fS , S non semi standard with 2 columns}
is the reduced Groebner basis of P (δ) for our ordering.

Proof:
   First denote NS the set of all monomials δ T with T non semi stan-
dard. Since each non semi standard T has 2 consecutive columns such
that the sub tableau defined by these 2 columns is non semi standard,
δ T is divisible by one of the δ S , i.e. by one of the leading term of fS .
   Thus the ideal < δ S > generated by the leading terms of G contains
the vector space span(NS).
   Conversely let T be a semi standard Young tableau. Suppose T
belongs to the ideal < LT (P (δ)) > generated by the leading terms of
all the f in P (δ). That means:
                                         X           ′
                           δT = f −          aT ′ δ T .
                                         T ′ <T

If any T is semi standard we keep this relation. If some of the T ′ are
         ′
                           ′
non semi standard, then δ T is in < δ S > thus in < LT (P (δ)) > and
                                  ′
we repeat the construction for δ T . We get finally:
                             X                 ′′
              δ T = f0 −              aT ′′ δ T , f0 ∈ P (δ).
                                 T ′′ <T
                          T ′′ semi standard
This implies that               X              ′′
                         δT +          aT ′′ δ T ∈ P (δ).
                                T ′′
                                       DIAMOND FOR sl(n)                                                    13

But this is impossible, since the set {δ T , T semi standard} is a basis
       (p)
for C[δi1 ,...,ip ]/P (δ) Thus:


                                    < LT (P (δ)) >= span(NS)


Moreover, since any monomial in fS is either δ S or aT δ T with T semi
                                          ′
standard, it can not be divisible by a δ S with S ′ 6= S, S ′ non semi
standard with two columns. This proves our theorem.

  The usual basis of the shape algebra S• (V ) by semi standard Young
tableaux can thus be described as a natural basis of a the quotient of
                           (p)
the polynomial algebra C[δi1 ,...,ip ] by the ideal of Plücker relations, if
we put the ordering < on the monomials δ T .

   Especially, we can write the action of any element of the Lie algebra
                                                   (s)
sl(n) on any polynomial function with variables δi1 ,...,ip , for instance, if
                                                    (p)
Xα = Eij i 6= j then Xα acts on C[δi1 ,...,ip ] as the derivation:


         d                                         X                     (p)                          ∂f
Xα f =      |s=0f (exp st Xα .) =                                    ±δ({i1 ,...,ip }\{j})∪{i}        (p)
                                                                                                                 .
         ds                                                                                      ∂δi1 ,...,ip
                                           {i1 ,...,ip }∩{i,j}={j}



Finally, the Cartan algebra acts on f as the derivation

                  d                       X                      (p)         ∂f
    Hf =             |s=0 f (exp st H.) =   (θi1 + · · · + θip )δi1 ,...,ip (p) ,
                  ds                                                       ∂δi ,...,i     1       p



                               
             θ1             0
if H =            ..           . This action defines the action on the quotient by
                        .
          0       θn
P (δ), since we have a Groebner basis for the ideal P (δ), the quotient
action on the basis of semi standard Young tableaux reduces to compute
the canonical form of the polynomial Xα f or Hf , this is easy to do
with usual computer software.
   As an illustration, we gives a graphic description of the N + part
of the adjoint representation Sω1 +ω2 (C3 ) of sl(3) (see [K] for similar
presentation).

    If we change our Weyl chamber, we can repeat this construction,
defining first anti semi standard tableaux as Young tableaux with en-
tries strictly decreasing in each column and decreasing in each row.
Then we define an ordering on the set of variables δis1 ,...,is , i1 > i2 >
                                                  (p)           (p)
· · · > is by putting: δ (1) > δ (2) > . . . and δi1 ,...,ip > δj1 ,...,jp if ip =
jp . . . ir+1 = jr+1 and ir > jr .


 Let T be an anti semi standard tableau. We can associate to T a
monomial:
                            (c )    (c )
                   δ T = δa11...a1 δa22...a2 . . .
                                     1    c1   1    c2
                                     (c )       (c )
                              =    ±δa11 ...a1 δa22 ...a2   ...
                                      c1     1   c2     1

and exchange the variables corresponding to columns with equal height,
                                                                   ′
then we get another Young tableau T ′ such that δ T = δ T .
For instance:
                   4 2           (2) (2)      (2) (2)          1 3
             T =          , δ43 δ21 = δ12 δ34 , T ′ =
                   3 1                                         2 4
or:
                 4 1                                            2 1
                              (3) (1)           (3) (1)    ′
           T = 3        , δ432 δ1 = −δ234 δ1 , T = 3                 .
                 2                                              4
Unfortunately, if n > 2, T ′ is generally not semi standard (T =
  3 1            2 1
        , T′ =           ) thus our change of ordering on the variables
  2              3
δ defines a new Groebner basis on the shape algebra if n > 2.
Now, the symmetry τ corresponds to the following operation on tableaux
since:
                        (s)                 (s)
                    τ (δi1 ,...,is ) = εsn δn+1−i1 ,...,n+1−is
We can define τ directly on Young tableaux by replacing each entry aij
of T by n + 1 − aij . The anti semi standard tableaux are exactly the
image by τ of the semi standard ones.


 6. The reduced shape algebra : Algebraic presentation

  Let V be a complex vector space with dimension n. From now one,
we shall study a quotient of the shape algebra S• (V ).
16             D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

Definition 2.
 Let R+ be the ideal in the shape algebra generated by v λ − 1:
                                                                                X

     = he1 − 1, e1 ∧ e2 − 1, . . . , e1 ∧ · · · ∧ en−1 − 1i.
                                                                 •
We call reduced shape algebra and write S•red (V ) the quotient S (V ) /R+ .

   This reduced shape algebra is no more a natural sl(n) module but
the ideal R is invariant under the action of the solvable group HN +
consisting of upper triangula matrices in SL(n). Thus the quotient is a
HN + module too. The action of the Cartan group H is still diagonal,
let study the N + (or n+ ) action on S•red (V )+ .

Proposition 2.
 Denote π + the canonical projection from S• (V ) to S•red (V )+ . Then
    • i) The space of vectors u ∈ S•red (V )+ such that n+ u = 0 is C1.
    • ii) S•red (V )+ is an indecomposable module.
    • iii) For any λ, the n+ module Sλ (V ) is equivalent to the sub-
      module π + Sλ (V ) of S•red (V )+ .                            
    • iv) For any λ > µ, π + (Sµ (V )) is a submodule of π + Sλ (V ) .

Proof
i) We know ([V] p. 317 for instance) that, in each Sλ (V ), the space
of vectors u such that n+ u = 0 is exactly Cv λ . This gives i) in the
quotient S•red (V )+ .

ii) Let u be a non zero vector in S•red (V )+ , the n+ module W generated
by u is finite dimensional since u is a finite sum of image through π + of
weights vectors. The n+ action is locally nilpotent on S• (V ), thus it is
also locally nilpotent on S•red (V )+ , as a consequence W contains a non
trivial vector annhilated by n+ . This vector is a multiple of 1. Thus
any n+ submodule of S•red (V )+ contains 1, S•red (V )+ is an indecompos-
able n+ module.

iii) Let πλ+ be the restriction of π + to Sλ (V ). It is a morphism of n+
modules. If its kernel is not vanishing, thanks to Lie theorem, the n+
module Ker(πλ+ ) contains a non zero vector annihilated by n+ , this
vector is a multiple of v λ , but π + (v λ ) = 1 6= 0. Thus πλ+ is an isomor-
phism of n+ modules.

iv) The relation λ > µ is equivalent to say there is ν dominant integral
weight such that λ = µ + ν. In S• (V ), the multiplication by v ν send
Sµ (V ) into Sλ (V ). In the quotient, this operation becomes the identity
mapping: π + (uv ν ) = π + (u) for any u in Sµ (V ).


  Similarly, we define S•red (V )− as the quotient of S• (V ) by the ideal
R generated by {en ∧ · · · ∧ en+1−s − 1, s = 1, . . . , n − 1}. It is a HN −
 −

module. If we denote π − the canonical morphism, we get the same
proposition with ′′ −′′ instead of ′′ +′′ everywhere.

Remark 3.
  In this presentation of S•red (V )+ , the N + action on the elements of
the reduced shape algebra is very natural since it is just:

             (g.f )(g ′) = f (t gg ′), g ∈ N + , g ′ ∈ N − , f ∈ C[N − ].

the exponential mapping from the Lie algebra n− (n+ ) onto the Lie
group N − (N + ) is a polynomial bijection with inverse polynomial too.


        8. The reduced shape algebra: Combinatorial
                         presentation
8.1. Super and quasi standard Young tableaux.
   In order to describe the restricted shape algebra and the restricted
Plücker relations, we have to perform the quotient of the preceding con-
                                       (s)
struction by the ideal generated by {δ12...s −1}. On the Young tableaux
this operation can be viewed as an ’extraction’ of trivial columns.

   A column whose height is c in a tableau is trivial if its entries are
1, 2, . . . , c, a Young tableau T is trivial if each column of T is trivial.
Now let T be a Young tableau (semi standard or not), we define the
extraction of trivial columns in T in the following manner:
   Denote aij the entries of T (aij is in the row i and the column j, for
any j, aij < a(i+1)j and the heights c1 , . . . , ct of T are decreasing). We
say that the tableau T is reducible if
        • there is a column j whose the s top entries are 1, 2, . . . , s (ai,j = i
            for 1 ≤ i ≤ s),
        • on the right of the column j, there is a column j ′ with height s
            in T (there is j ′ ≥ j such that cj ′ = s),
        • for any k > j, if ck−1 > s and ck ≥ s, as+1,k−1 > as,k .
   Let T be a reducible Young tableau, let j the smallest index and s
the largest index for which the above conditions hold. Let us suppress
the trivial top part of the column j and shift to the left the right parts
of the s first rows (i.e. we shift to the left every aik with 1 ≤ i ≤ s and
j < k), then we get a Young tableau R1 : the entries of R1 are bkℓ with
                    
                    ak(ℓ+1) if 1 ≤ k ≤ s and j ≤ ℓ ≤ t − 1
              bkℓ =
                    
                       akℓ      if    s<k          or       ℓ < j.
If the number of column of T was t, then R1 has t − 1 column, more
precisely if the heights of the columns of T were: (c1 , . . . , ct ) and the
columns of heights s had the number j ′ , . . . , j ′′ , then the heights of the
columns of R1 are (c′1 , . . . , c′t−1 ) with
                      
                       c′k = ck            if 1 ≤ k < j ′′
                  ′
                 ck =
                       ′
                          ck = ck+1 if j ′′ ≤ k ≤ t − 1.

Simultaneously, we define L1 as the Young tableau with only one trivial
column with entries 1, . . . , s.

  Now if R1 is reducible, we repeat the above operation, extracting a
second trivial column from R1 , getting two Young tableaux a trivial
one with two columns L2 and a Young tableau R2 with t − 2 columns.
  Repeating this construction, after m steps, we get a trivial Young
tableau Lm with m column and a Young tableau Rm with t−m columns.
  This construction stops when the Young tableau Rm is not reducible
we say Rm is irreducible and call Rm the residue of T .




Definition 3. (Super, left and right Young tableaux)
  A super Young tableau is a pair S = (L, R) of two Young tableaux,
the left one L is a trivial Young tableau, the right one, R is an irre-
ducible Young tableau. L or R can be the empty tableau without any
column.

  Our construction defines a mapping f (the extraction mapping) from
the set Y of Young tableaux into the set SY of super young tableaux
                              f (T ) = S = (L, R).
    If λ is the sequence of the heights of the column of T : λ = (c1 ≤
· · · ≤ ct ) and µ = (c′1 ≤ · · · ≤ c′ℓ ) and ν = (c′′1 ≤ · · · ≤ c′′r ) the corre-
sponding sequence for L and R (one of these sequences can be empty),
then µ and ν are two disjoint subsequences of λ and λ is the ’union’ of
µ and ν: we refind the sequence λ by putting together the elements of
µ and ν and ordering them in a decreasing sequence.

   Starting with an irreducible Young tableau R, we can insert to it
any family of trivial columns, say {D1 , . . . , Dℓ }, getting a new tableau
T . We insert these column in the following way: if the height of Di is
di, we insert D1 , . . . , Di such that any column of T , after Di has height
strictly less then di , the columns of T before Di are the columns of R
with length at least di, with their ordering and the column Dj (j < i).
Then T is a Young tableau. Of course, if ℓ > 0, T is reducible.

  Let us try to extract a trivial column from T . Among the new
column, the first one is D1 with height d1 . In T this column is the
column p. Suppose the first trivial column extracted from T is the s
22             D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

top elements of the column j, with j < p. Since R is irreducible, there
is a k > j such that cR            R          R          R
                         k−1 > s, ck ≥ s and as+1,k−1 ≤ as,k (we denote
cR                                    R
 k the height of the column k and ai,j the i, j-entry in R). We choose
the smallest such k. Since we can now extract the trivial column from
T , there is, in T , at least one new column, say D between the two
columns k − 1, k in R, which are now columns k1 , k2 in T . We choose
for D the last one: D is the column k2 − 1 in T . The height of D is
cTk2 −1 = d > cTk2 = cR
                      k ≥ s and we get:

                 aTs+1,k2 −1 = s + 1 ≤ aR          R      T
                                        s+1,k−1 ≤ as,k = as,k2 .

We cannot extract the trivial column consisting of the s top elements
of the column j, with j < p. Of course, we can extract all the col-
umn p of T . Thus, in the computing of f (T ), the first step is just to
eliminate the column D1 from T , repeating this construction, we get
f (T ) = (L, R) where L is the trivial tableau (D1 , . . . , Dℓ ). We proved
that f is a surjective mapping by defining a mapping h from SY to Y
such that f ◦ h(L, R) = (L, R).

Definition 4. (Quasi standard tableaux)
  A super Young tableau S = (L, R) is said quasi-standard if its right
tableau R is semistandard.
  A Young tableau T is said quasi-standard if it is irreducible and
semistandard.
  Let us denote by QSY (resp. QY) the set of quasi standard super
Young tableaux (resp. quasi standard Young tableaux). Denote SEM
the set of semistandard Young tableaux.

Lemma 1. (f is a bijection from SEM onto QSY)
  The mapping f , when restricted to SEM is a one-to-one onto map-
ping from SEM onto QSY.

Proof
  First it is clear that if T is semistandard, then each tableau in the
sequence R1 , . . . , Rm defined above is still semistandard, then f is a
map from SEM to QSY.

  Now let S = (L, R) be an element of QSY. Denote the rows of
L by (L′1 , . . . , L′u ), their lengths being ℓ′1 , . . . , ℓ′u . Similarly, denote
(L′′1 , . . . , L′′v ) the rows of R, their lengths being ℓ′′1 , . . . , ℓ′′v .We define
the new tableau T = g(S) as the tableau with the row i contains (from
                              DIAMOND FOR sl(n)                                  23

left to right) ℓ′i entries i, then the ℓ′′i entries of the row i of R. In fact, T
is a Young tableau since if aTi,j is an entry of T , it is either i or an entry
of R (aTi,j = aR             R                                          T
                 i,j−ℓ′i if ar,s are the entries of R). In any case, ai,j ≥ i.
    If aTi,j = i, then aTi,j = i < i + 1 ≤ aTi+1,j . If aTi,j = aR   i,j−ℓ′i , since
 ′      ′
ℓi ≥ ℓi+1 , ai+1,j = ai+1,j−ℓ′ and ai,j = ai,j−ℓ′ < ai+1,j−ℓ′ ≤ aR
              T           R               T      R        R
                                                                     i+1,j−ℓ′i+1 =
                                 i+1                 i          i
  T
ai+1,j .
    T is semistandard: by construction each row in T is a increasing
sequence of entries. g is a map from QSY to SEM.

   The map g is the inverse mapping of f . Indeed if T is semistandard,
if a column C of T begins by a trivial part, then all the columns before
C begin with the same trivial part and suppressing the top of the first
column or the top of C is the same operation, thus to construct the
sequence R1 , . . . , Rm , we just have to consider the first column at each
step.
   Starting with T = g(S), we can extract at each step a trivial column
having the height of the corresponding column of L, but no more, since
R is irreducible. Thus f ◦ g(S) = S, for any S ∈ QSY.
   Conversely, starting with a semistandard T , we build first f (T ) =
(L, R) and by construction the rows of L are the left part of the rows
of T , thus g ◦ f (T ) = T .

  In this section we shall repeat the construction of section 3 but for
the ideal R(δ)+ and the quasi standard Young tableaux.

   First, we choose the following elimination order on the variables δ:
                                 (s)                    (s)
defining the degree deg(δi1 ...is ) as 1 if is > s (δi1 ...is is not trivial) and 0
            (s)
if is = s (δi1 ...is is trivial), the degree of δ T is the sum of degree of each
variables and T > T ′ if and only if:
                                ′
        deg(δ T ) > deg(δ T )
     or
                                ′
         deg(δ T ) = deg(δ T ) and T > T ′ for the preceding ordering.

  Now we look for the leading terms of elements of R(δ)+ , for this
ordering. We saw that the leading terms of elements of P (δ) for the
preceding ordering were non semistandard monomials.

     Let T be a non quasi standard tableau.

Case 1: T is non semi standard.

  Then T contains a non semistandard tableau with two columns T 0 :
           0
δ = δ U δ T . For T 0 , we saw there is a Plücker relation PT 0 in P (δ)
 T

whose leading term for the ordering of section 3 was T 0 .

Case 1.1: T 0 contains a trivial column Ci , since T 0 is non semistan-
                                         0     (s) (c)           (s)
dard, it is its second column. δ T = δ1,...,s δa1 ,...,ac . But δ1,...,s is the
                                         (s)                 0
leading term of the element Vs = δ1,...,s − 1 in R(δ)+ . δ T is the leading
             (c)
term of δ U δa1 ,...,ac Vs which is in R(δ)+ .
                                                               0     (s)     (c)
Case 1.2: T 0 does not contain any trivial column. δ T = δb1 ,...,bs δa1 ,...,ac
with c ≥ s, there is j such that aj > bj , we choose the largest such
j, due to our conventions of writing, if c = s then j < s and ac > c,
bs > s.
   Thus the relation PT 0 has the following form:
                0        P         (s)               (c)
      PT 0 = δ T −              ±δA∪{bj+1 ,...,bs } δ({a1 ,...,ac }\A)∪{b1 ,...,bj }
                        A⊂{a1 ,...,ac }
                          #A=j
                   0           P
             = δT −                        ±δ (S) .
                             S<T 0
                        S semi standard

If a tableau S in this relation contains a trivial column, i.e S = C1 C2
with C1 trivial, we replace S by C2 since
                                 δ S − δ C2 = Vs .δ C2 .
Repeating this operation, we get an element
                             0
                                    X
                  PT′ 0 = δ T −             ±δ (S) .
                                               S<T 0
                                          S quasi standard




Case 2: T is semi standard.

   If T has only one column, this column is trivial T is the leading term
of some PT = δ T − 1 in R(δ)+ .
   Since T is semi standard the construction of the super Young tableau
f (T ) begins with the extraction of the top s elements 1, . . . , s of the
first column of T . Let us look to the two first columns of T , C1T and

   Let us define ∂T as the tableau with the following first columns C1∂T
and C2∂T :
                      ∂T          (c )                           ∂T                 (c )

the other columns of ∂T being         =                   Ci∂T
                                             (i ≥ 3). Let us write the   CiT
Plücker relation corresponding to these two columns and s:

                             A

   Each term δ TA in the sum has a second column containing ai with
                                    (c2 )                     T
i > s, thus ai ≥ as+1 > bs and δA∪{b      s+1 ,...,bc2 }

   If c2 = s, deg(δ ∂T ) < deg(δ T ), δ T is the leading term of an element
in R(δ)+ . If c2 > s, we repeat this construction for ∂T , forgotting its
first column. We get the following element of R(δ)+ :

Each term δ TB in the sum has a third column containing bi with i > s,
                         (c3 )                     T
thus bi ≥ bs+1 > cs and δB∪{c  s+1 ,...,cc3 }
                                              < δ C3 , δ TB < δ T .
   Repeating this operation we finally get an element in R(δ)+ of the
form:                                         X

                                                                                                               k
with δ < δ for all j, the column k + 1 of ∂ k T is trivial, deg(δ ∂ T ) <
        Tj        T

deg(δ T ) and δ T is the leading term of an element of R(δ)+ .


Remark 4.
26            D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

  The tableau ∂ k T considered here is (perhaps up a reordering of the
columns with height s ) the tableau h(C, R1 ) if C is the first trivial
column:
                                     (s)
                              δ C = δ1...s
and R1 the first step in the process of trivial columns extraction from
T.
     We got an element of R(δ)+ :
                               X
                  δ T − δ R1 −    ±δ Tj (R1 < T, Tj < T )
If R1 is quasi standard, we stop the process. If it is not the case, we
continue the extraction, getting new tableauxPTk′ < R1 < T . Finally we
get: T = g(L, R) with L 6= ∅ and δ T − δ R −     ak δkT belongs to R(δ)+ .
                                              Tk <T
R is quasi standard R < T, Tk < T . We repeat this operation P
                                                             for each
                                                   T    R
non quasi standard Tk ; getting an element PT = δ − δ −         ak δ Tk

with Tk < T , Tk quasi standard, P (T ) in R(δ) .
   We proved that each non quasi standard Young tableau is the lead-
ing term of an explicit element PT of R(δ)+ . Let us now prove that
any quasi standard Young tableau is not a leading term of an element
in R(δ)+ .

   Let λ be a highest weight for sl(n) and V λ the corresponding simple
module. We saw that V λ is naturally a sub-module of S•red (V ). More
precisely, V λ is the space spanned by the classes modulo R(δ)+ of the
monomials δ T for all Young tableau T of shape λ. A basis for V λ is
given by the classes of the monomials δ T for T semi standard with
shape λ in the quotient C[δ]/R(δ)+ . Let us consider the sub-space W λ
of V λ spanned by the quasi standard and semi standard Young tableau
of shape λ.
A basis of V λ is given by the classes of δ T , T semi standard with shape
λ modulo R(δ)+ . Either T is quasi standard   P      and (δ T ) is a basis of
   λ
W or T = g(L, R), we saw δ − δ = T     R
                                                 ak δ modulo R(δ)+ with
                                                     Tk

Tk quasi standard Tk < T and R is quasi   P standard     with shape µ < λ.
This proves that V λ is a subspace of          W µ .But since g is injective,
           P                         M µ≤λ
dimV = λ               µ
               dim(W ) thus V =  λ
                                          W µ.
            µ≤λ                       µ≤λ
   Let now T be a quasi standard Young tableau
                                             P of Tshape λ. Suppose
δ is the leading term of an element T + k ak δ k in R(δ)+ , then
 T

using the first part of the proof, we can replace each δ Tk with a non
quasi standard Tk , by a linear combination of δ Tj with quasi standard
                              DIAMOND FOR sl(n)                        27

Tj modulo
     P    R(δ)+ . Finally we get an element in R(δ)+ of the form
          Tj
T + j aj δ with any Tj quasi standard and strictly smaller than T .
The shapePµj of Tj is thus smaller than λ. But this is impossible since
the sum    W µ is direct.
              µ≤λ
  Finally, as in section 3, for each non quasi standard Young tableau,
we got an element in R(δ)+ of the form:
                                        X
                          PTred = δ T −   aj δ Tj
                                          j
         Tj                        T
with δ        strictly smaller than δ and quasi standard.

  Let T be a non quasi standard tableau with shape λ. We shall say
that T is minimal if it does not contain any non quasi standard tableau
with shape µ < λ. For instance a semi standard non quasi standard
tableau with one column or with 2 columns without trivial column are
minimal.
  If n ≤ 3 there are no other semi standard, minimal, non quasi stan-
dard tableaux, but if n ≥ 4 there is semi standard, minimal, non quasi
standard tableau with 3 columns for instance:

                                   1 2 3
                                   3 4

Theorem 4. The Groebner basis

  The set
      T
G = {Pred , T semi standard minimal non quasi standard or
  T non semi standard with 2 columns, without any trivial column}
is the reduced Groebner basis of R(δ)+ for our ordering.

Proof:
 We saw that
                < LT (R(δ)+ ) >= {δ T , T non quasi standard}.
  If T contains a trivial column C, δ T is divisible by δ C and C is min-
imal semi standard non quasi standard.

  If T is non semi standard, it contains a non semi standard tableau
S with 2 columns, without any trivial column.
28            D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

  If T does not contain any trivial column and is semi standard then
by definition it contains a minimal non quasi standard tableau S but
S is by construction semi standard.

     Thus
                    < LT (G) >=< LT (R(δ)+ ) > .
                             T
Now each monomial in any Pred   of G which are not the leading term,
        T ′      ′
are aT δ with T quasi standard.
      ′

  But if S ⊂ T ′ , then S is also quasi standard. Indeed, S is semi
standard, suppose S non quasi standard then S contains a first column
                      C1 = (1, 2, . . . , s, as+1, . . . , aC1 ),
other column
                        Ci = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bs , bs+1 , . . . )
a last column
                         Ct = (c1 , c2 , . . . , cct ) with t ≤ s.
We can extract (1, 2, . . . , s) from S.
   Now, we can refind T from S by adding some columns before C1 ,
between columns of S or after Ct . But T is semi standard. By con-
sidering each case for these new columns, we directly see that the top
(1, 2, . . . , s) of columns C1 can still be extracted from T which is im-
possible since T is quasi standard.
                        T
  Thus any monomial of Pred is not divisible by the leading term of
         T
another Pred .

  This means that G is the reduced Groebner basis of R(δ)+ for our
ordering.

  The same result holds with the anti standard tableau, image by τ of
the quasi standard tableaux.

  The anti quasi standard tableaux can be defined exactly as the quasi
standard tableaux by extracting ”trivial” top of columns like:
                                          n
                                         n−1
                                          ..
                                           .
                                         n−s
     They are still the image by τ of the quasi standard tableaux.

Remark 5.
   In fact, if n ≤ 3, the quasi satndard Grobner basis is invariant under
the action of θ. Similarly, with the symmetry τ , if we identify τ (T ) with
±T ′ with T ′ the Young tableau such that δτ (T ) = δT ′ , then T quasi
standard implies T ′ quasi standard. In the study of sl(4) below, we
shall see this no more true for n > 3.




  Let us now picture the adjoint representation of sl(3) in S+

                                         9. The sl(2) case


9.1. Representations of sl(2).
  The sl(2)-simple modules are charachterized by a highest weight a.
More precesely, the basis of sl(2) is:

If a is a positive integer, the simple module π a acting on the space V a

   There is only one fundamental representation, associated to the
weight ω1 . We realize it in the space generated by the functions
 (1)            (1)
δ1 (g) = g11 , δ2 (g) = g21 . The other representations are realized
on the space of homogeneous polynomial functions of degree a in these
variables.


9.2. Shape and reduced shape algebra.
  There are no Plücker relation between g11 and g22 , thus the shape
algebra is isomorphic to the algebra
                       A• (V ) = C[g11 , g21 ] ≃ S(V ).
The reduced shape algebra is the quotient by the ideal generated by
g11 − 1. Let us put:
                                               
            −      0 0        −          −

          n =             , N = exp n =                  .
                   x 0                           x 1
Then:
                                 S•red (V )+ = C[δ21 ] = C[X],
The Xα acts on a polynomial function as the operator:
                                                  ∂
                                           Xα =        .
                                                ∂X
We realize the sl(2)-diamond cone as the half line of the entire nodes
0, 1, . . . , a, a + 1, . . . , at each node n, we put the quasi standard Young
tableau 2 . . . 2 or the monomial X n . We have an explicit basis for

Xα , pictured by the graph:

                               DIAMOND FOR sl(n)                                37



    For any a ≥ 0, we define the diamond Da as the graph generated by
X , the vector space V a as the vector space with basis the nodes of
  a

Da .
We saw that the anti semi standard (resp. the anti quasi standard) ba-
sis can be identified with the semi standard (resp. the quasi standard)
basis. More precisely, a being fixed, the action of τ on V a , denoted by
τ (a) is defined as:



                                τ (a) (X n ) = X a−n


                        τ (a) ( 2 . . . 2 ) = 2 . . . 2


  We can see τ (a) as the succession of the operations:
      •   Completion of the tableau T (compl[2 . . . 2] = [1 . . . 1][2 . . . 2])
      •   Action of τ (τ (compl[2 . . . 2]) = [2 . . . 2][1 . . . 1])
      •   reordering (ord(τ (compl[2 . . . 2])) = [1 . . . 1][2 . . . 2])
      •   Cancelling the trivial columns 1
We put:

              Yα (X n ) = (τ (a) ◦ Xα ◦ τ (a) )(X n ) = (a − n)X n+1

and Hα = [Xα , Yα ] or:

      Hα (X n ) = [(n + 1)(a − n) − n(a − n + 1)]X n = (a − 2n)X n .

We complete the diamond Da by adding the edges corresponding to
the Yα -action.




                              10. The sl(3) case



10.1. Representations of sl(3).
38            D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

 The sl(3)-simple modules are characterized by their highest weight.
More precisely, the basis of sl(3) is:
                                                        

            0 0 0                    0 0 −1
                                                      
            0 0 0                 0 0 0             0 0 0
    Yα = 1 0 0 , Yβ = 0 0 0 , Yα+β = 0 0 0 .
            0 0 0                 0 1 0             1 0 0
The simple modules have non multiplicity free weights. We can describe
then by using the reduced shape algebra. The fundamental modules
are three dimensional, they are realized on the space V ω1 = C3 and
V ω2 = ∧2 C3 .
For each pair of natural integers, there is an unique irreducible repre-
sentation π(a, b) with highest weight a̟1 + b̟2 .


10.2. Shape and reduced shape algebra.
  Now we have just one Plücker relation: let us put as above:
 (1)                              (1)                       (1)
δ1 = g11 ,                   δ2 = g21 ,                     δ3 = g31
 (2)                              (2)                       (2)
δ12 = g11 g22 − g12 g21 ,    δ13 = g11 g32 − g12 g31 , δ23 = g21 g32 − g22 g31 .
Then the unique Plücker relation is:
                        (1) (2)         (1) (2)   (1) (2)
                       δ1 δ23 − δ2 δ13 + δ3 δ12 = 0.
The shape algebra is the quotient of the algebra of polynomial functions
in these 6 variables by the above relation.
                                                           (1)
    The reduced shape algebra is obtained by imposing δ1 = 1 and
  (2)
δ12 = 1.
    An explicit description of a basis for this module V (a,b) and the
Xη , Yη , H η actions on this basis can be found in [W] for instance.
More precisely, Wildberger defines a diamond cone D in R3 and a in-
finite dimensional vector space V with basis:
       B = {em,n,ℓ , (m, n, ℓ) ∈ D ⊂ R3 }
         = {em,n,ℓ , m, n ≥ 0, −n ≤ ℓ ≤ 2m − n, m − 2n ≤ ℓ ≤ m,
         ℓ ≡ max(m, n)mod2}.

He defines the action of Xη on these vectors em,n,ℓ and the irreducible
module V (a,b) with highest weight a̟1 + b̟2 is the module generated
by the Xη action on the highest weight vector ea+b,a+b,a−b .
  A basis for this module is an explicit subset B(a,b) of B. There is a
symmetry τ(a,b) on V (a,b) , τ(a,b) (B(a,b) ) = B(a,b) and the Yη , Hη actions
are defined as:
                         Yη = τ(a,b) ◦ Xη ◦ τ(a,b) , Hη = [Xη , Yη ]
see [W] for explicit formulas.

and
            S•red (V )+ ≃ C[x, y, u]
                                     (1)     (1)   (2)    (2)
                          = C[δ2 , δ3 , δ13 , δ23 ] /               (1)     (2)    (1) (2)
                                                                 hδ3 + δ23 − δ2 δ13 i
                          = C[X, Y, U, E] /hU + E − XY i .

  The quasi standard ordering on variables is:
                   (1)         (1)         (2)      (2)
                 δ3 < δ2 < δ23 < δ13 , or U > X > E > Y.
                                                                 (1) (2)
Then the leading term for this basis is δ2 δ13 = XY , thus we get the
basis:
n                                                       o
    (1)    (2)     (1)
  (δ3 )u (δ23 )e (δ2 )x = U u E e X x , u, e, x ∈ N
             [ n (1)        (2)     (1)
                                                                           o
                   (δ3 )u (δ23 )e (δ2 )y = U u E e Y y , u, e, y ∈ N, y > 0 .


   Now the action of Xα , Xβ and Xα+β on these polynomials are the
following:

            Xα =      −     ,                    Xβ =      +     ,          Xα+β =      ,

Then the Xη acting by derivations on the polynomial functions φ, we
refind the diamond cone, the diamond D (a,b) , the vector space V (a,b) , the
symmetry τ(a,b) and the complete diamond graphs on D (a,b) described
in [W] with the identification:

10.3. Xη action, Symmetry and Yη action.
  With our notations, we have the following identification between
column and variables X, U, Y, E:
                                (1)
                         X = δ2 (g)         −→       2

  For instance the Xα action on our basis is exactly the Wildberger’s
one:

  For sl(3), our symmetry τ on quasi standard Young tableaux induces
a very simple transformation on V (a,b) .
  Starting with a quasi standard Young tableau T with a′ columns of
height 1 and b′ columns of height 2, a′ ≤ a and b′ ≤ b, we complete T
                                                              1
by adding a − a′ trivial columns 1 and b′ − b trivial columns   . For
                                                              2
instance:
                    2 2 2 2 3                      1 2 2 1 1 2 2 3
a = 5, b = 3 T =                   , compl(T ) =
                    3 3                            2 3 3
Then we compute τ (compl(T )), we reorganize the columns as above
and finally we suppress the trivial columns, on our example:
                                       3 2 2 3 3 2 2 1
               τ (compl(T )) =
                                       2 1 1

                                         1 1 2 1 2 2 3 3
                                = −
                                         2 2 3

                                         2 2 2 3 3
                                ≃ −
                                         3
The resulting quasi standard tableau will be denoted τ (a,b) (T ). Explic-
itly we get with the polynomial notations:
                     τ (a,b) (U u E e X x ) = U a−(x+u) E b−e X x
                     τ (a,b) (U u E e X x ) = U a−u E b−(y+e) Y y
or:
                     τ (a,b) (em,n,ℓ ) = ea+b−n,a+b−m,a−b+m−n−ℓ

The fundamental representations are 4 and 6 dimensional, they are
associted to the fundamental highest weight ω1 for the canonical repre-
sentation on V = C4 , ω2 for the representation on ∧2 V and ω3 for the
representation on ∧3 V . These fundamental representations are easy
to describe, the reduction of the tensor product of any two of them is
completely described in [FH]. Especially, we get the Plücker relations
via this decomposition.

Then we have 4 Plücker relations between the δ (1) and δ (2) :

There are also 4 relations between the δ (2) and δ (3) :
                        (2) (3)      (2) (3)       (2) (3)
                      δ14 δ234 − δ24 δ134 + δ34 δ124 = 0,

                      δ13 δ234 − δ23 δ134 + δ34 δ123 = 0.
And one between the δ (2) :

                       δ12 δ34 − δ13 δ24 + δ14 δ23 = 0.
And finally one between the δ (1) and the δ (3) :
                  (1) (3)      (1) (3)     (1) (3)           (1) (3)
                 δ1 δ234 − δ2 δ134 + δ3 δ124 − δ4 δ123 = 0.
   The shape algebra is the quotient of the algebra of polynomial func-
tions in these 14 variables by the 10 above relations.

   The reduced shape algebra is obtained by imposing δ1 = 1, δ12 = 1

and δ123 = 1.

                     = C[X, Y, Z, U, E, W, V, A, C, D, B]/P luck
where P luck is the ideal generated by the 10 polynomials:
P luck = hU − XY + E, D − XV + A, B − UV + Y A, XB − UD + AE,
          B − Y D + EV, C − XW1 + UZ − A,
              V C − DW + P Z, W − Y Z + V, C − EZ + D, Y C − EW + Bi.

     We choosed the following ordering for our variables:
             Z < W < C < Y < E < V < D < B < X < U < A.
Then the leading terms of this basis are:
 XY, XV, UV, BX, Y Z, EZ, Y C, V C, XW, EV, UDW, UDY.
Now the basis of our space, i.e. the nodes of the sl(4)-diamond are
monomials
                  X x Y y Z z W w V v U u E e Aa C c D d B b
with:
0 = xy = xv = uv = bx = yz = ez = yc = vc = xw = ev = udw = udy.

  The action of our generators Xα , Xβ and Xγ on these polynomials
are:
                             y       yz v 
                  Xα = ∂x − ∂u +         −    ∂w ,

                             x       z     xz
                  Xβ = ∂y + ∂u − ∂v − ∂w ,
                             2      2xy u6
                             y
                  Xγ = ∂z + ∂v +         +    ∂w .

                          DIAMOND FOR sl(n)                           45

Then we get:


               Xα (X) = 1,    Xβ (X) = 0,    Xγ (X) = 0,

               Xα (Y ) = 0,   Xβ (Y ) = 1,   Xγ (Y ) = 0,

               Xα (Z) = 0,    Xβ (Z) = 0,    Xγ (Z) = 1,

               Xα (U) = 0,    Xβ (U) = X,    Xγ (U) = 0,

               Xα (E) = Y,    Xβ (E) = 0,    Xγ (E) = 0,

               Xα (W ) = 0, Xβ (W ) = Z, Xγ (W ) = 0,

               Xα (V ) = 0,   Xβ (V ) = 0,   Xγ (V ) = Y,

               Xα (A) = 0,    Xβ (A) = 0,    Xγ (A) = U,

               Xα (C) = W, Xβ (C) = 0,       Xγ (C) = 0,

               Xα (D) = V,    Xβ (D) = 0,    Xγ (D) = V,

               Xα (B) = 0,    Xβ (B) = D,    Xγ (B) = 0.


   Thus the Xη for η simple are acting on our basis of the reduced shape
algebra by giving linear combination with integral coefficients, indeed,
we find first such a linear combination on Z (even Z+ ) coefficients but
on monomials which are perhaps not all admissible, then we come back
to admissible monomials, using the reduced Plücker relations, but these
relations are with coefficients ±1, thus we finally get a combination of
monomials in the basis with coefficients in Z.


11.3. Symmetry.
   Now the symmetry τ on Young tableaux does not induce a simple
operation τ (abc) on the basis of the simple module V (abc) .
                                1 3
For instance the tableau 2             = ZU is an element of the basis
                                4
     (1,0,1)
of V         (see fig.). Repeating the operation performed for sl(2) and
46           D. ARNAL, N. BEL BARAKA, AND N. WILDBERGER

sl(3), we get:


       1 3                     1 3             1 3         4 2      1 2
compl( 2   )=                  2   , τ (compl( 2   )) =    3     =− 3
       4                       4               4           1        4


but this tableau is not quasi standard: the extraction of the trivial top
 1 of the first column is not trivial:


                                 1 3     2        1 3
                     (1,0,1)
                 τ             ( 2   )=− 3    −   2       + 4
                                 4       4        4


or:


                      τ (1,0,1) (ZU) = −W X = −C − ZU + A


We prefer to keep the new Groebner basis to see τ as a global change
of basis inside the reduced shape algebra and to realize Yτη = τ Xη τ by
using the two basis. For instance in V (101) the basis is:


      {1, X, U, A, Z, W, C, W U, W A, CU, CA, CX, ZU, ZA, ZX}


the image by τcompl of this basis is:


       {AC, UC, XC, C, W A, ZA, A, ZX, Z, X, 1, W X, W, W U}


The matrix of Yτη on this new basis is exactly the matrix of Xη in the
old one.
