                                             Abstract : Translated into the language of representations of quivers, a challenge in matrix pencil
                                             theory is to find sufficient and necessary conditions for a Kronecker representation to be a subfactor of
                                             another Kronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants. The problem is reduced to
                                             a numerical criterion for a Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another Kronecker
                                             representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants. The key to the problem is the calculation
                                             of ranks of matrices over polynomial rings. For this, a generalization and specialization approach
                                             is introduced. This approach is applied to provide a numerical criterion for a preprojective (resp.
                                             regular, preinjective) Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another preprojective
                                             (resp. regular, preinjective) Kronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants.




                                             Introduction
                                             The classification of Kronecker representations was started by Weierstrass in 1867 and
                                             completed by Kronecker in 1890. A natural problem is to classify the subrepresentations
                                             of Kronecker representations, i.e., the pairs (N, M) in which N is a subrepresentation
                                             of a Kronecker representation M, just as has been done for uniserial rings by Ringel
                                             and Schmidmeier [9]. However this problem is hopeless to solve completely: Indeed,
                                                ∗

which satisfy the relations β2 γ1 − α1 β1 = β2 γ2 − α2 β1 = 0 and which are such that
the maps β1 and β2 are inclusion maps [1]. For this, one would have to classify the
representations of the quiver

                                            α2
which are such that the map β2 is an inclusion map. This problem is clearly wild
[8]. Nevertheless we may study the subrepresentations of Kronecker representations in
another interesting way, namely, to find a numerical criterion for a Kronecker represen-
tation to be a subrepresentation of another Kronecker representation in terms of their
Kronecker invariants. Later on we will see that the solution of this problem is also the
solution of the first part of the challenge below.
    Our original motivation is based on a challenge in matrix pencil theory. In [7, p.
329] the following question, which is closely related to pole placement, non-regular
feedback, dynamic feedback, zero placement and early-stage design in control theory
is declared to be a “challenge” by the authors.
    Recall that a matrix pencil over a field K is a matrix λE + H where λ is an in-
determinate and E, H are matrices over K of the same size. Two matrix pencils
λE1 + H1 and λE2 + H2 of the same size are said to be strictly equivalent, denoted
λE1 + H1 ∼ λE2 + H2 , if there exist invertible constant matrices P and Q such that
λE1 + H1 = P (λE2 + H2 )Q.
    Challenge. [7] Let E, H ∈ R(m+n)×(p+q) and E ′ , H ′ ∈ Rm×p . Find necessary and
sufficient conditions in terms of Kronecker invariants of the matrix pencils λE +H and
λE ′ + H ′ for the existence of matrix pencils F12 (λ), F21 (λ) and F22 (λ) such that λE +
         λE ′ + H ′ F12 (λ)
H ∼                              holds. Moreover, provide an algorithm for constructing
            F21 (λ) F22 (λ)
F12 (λ), F21 (λ) and F22 (λ) whenever a solution exists.
    The following was mentioned in [5, p. 62] : “The problem of giving necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of a matrix pencil with prescribed Kronecker
invariants and a prescribed arbitrary subpencil remains open and seems to be very
difficult.” However, partial answers are known when λE + H and λE ′ + H ′ are both
regular [2, 10, 11]; when λE + H is regular and λE ′ + H ′ is arbitrary [4]; when λE + H
is arbitrary and λE ′ + H ′ is regular [5]; when λE + H has rank equal to the number
of its rows and λE ′ + H ′ has rank equal to the number of its columns [3].

                                                 2
    Three approaches, i.e., matrix pencil approach, polynomial approach, and geometric
approach, have been used to attack the Challenge, see [7] and the references cited there.
In this paper we provide the fourth approach, namely representations of quivers. Here
we focus on the first part of the challenge.
    The contents of this paper is organized as follows: In section 1, we first translate the
Challenge into the language of representations of quivers. Thus the Challenge is found
equivalent to finding sufficient and necessary conditions for a Kronecker representation
to be a subfactor of another Kronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker in-
variants. Then the problem is reduced to finding a numerical criterion for a Kronecker
representation to be a subrepresentation of another Kronecker representation in terms
of their Kronecker invariants. And thus the problem becomes fairly elementary. The
key point is to calculate the ranks of matrices over polynomial rings. Finally we extend
the underlying field from the field of real numbers R to the field of complex numbers
C and more generally we work on an arbitrary algebraically closed field K. Thus the
Kronecker invariants of a Kronecker representation can be expressed simply by a set of
positive integers. In section 2, we consider the homomorphisms between two Kronecker
representations, i.e., the matrix pairs that satisfy two equations [1]. We partition such
a matrix pair into a block matrix pair. Via easy calculations one can learn the explicit
form of each block in the matrix pair. This is very useful. In section 3, we obtain a
numerical criterion for a preprojective (resp. regular, preinjective) Kronecker represen-
tation to be a subrepresentation of another preprojective (resp. regular, preinjective)
Kronecker representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants. This follows from the
calculation of the rank of matrices over polynomial rings using the generalization and
specialization approach.


1      Reduction of the Challenge

1.1    Translation into the Language of Representations of Quiv-
       ers
Recall that the Kronecker quiver is the quiver with two vertices 1, 2 and two arrows α
and β from 1 to 2. A Kronecker representation M, i.e., a representation of the Kro-
necker quiver, can be written as (M(1), M(2); M(α), M(β)) or (M(α), M(β)), where
M(1), M(2) are the vector spaces associated with the vertices 1, 2 respectively and
M(α), M(β) : M(1) → M(2) are the linear maps that are represented by the arrows
α and β, respectively. For more on representation theory of quivers we refer to [1].
Denote by K the representation category of the Kronecker quiver. Note that in this
paper we always consider subrepresentations up to isomorphism. As a result, we say
a Kronecker representation N = (N(α), N(β)) is a subrepresentation of a Kronecker
representation M = (M(α), M(β)) if there is a monomorphism from N to M, or

                                             3
equivalently if there are injective linear maps φ and ψ such that M(α)φ = ψN(α)
and M(β)φ = ψN(β). Dually, a Kronecker representation N = (N(α), N(β)) is called
a factor representation of a Kronecker representation M = (M(α), M(β)) if there is
an epimorphism from M to N, or equivalently if there are surjective linear maps φ
and ψ such that N(α)φ = ψM(α) and N(β)φ = ψM(β). A subfactor of a Kronecker
representation M is a factor representation of a subrepresentation of M, equivalently
a subrepresentation of a factor representation of M.
    Clearly a matrix pencil λE + H corresponds to a Kronecker representation (E, H).
Moreover, two matrix pencils λE1 + H1 and λE2 + H2 are strictly equivalent if and
only if (E1 , H1 ) and (E2 , H2 ) are isomorphic as Kronecker representations, i.e., if there
are invertible matrices G1 and G2 such that G2 E1 = E2 G1 and G2 H1 = H2 G1 . In this
way, the Challenge amounts to finding matrices E12       , E21 , E22 , H12 ,H21 , and H22
                                                                                         such

that the two Kronecker representations (E, H) and                         ,                 are

isomorphic. If such a solution exists, then we write λE + H ≻ λE ′ + H ′ or λE ′ + H ′ ≺
λE + H or (E, H) ≻ (E ′ , H ′) or (E ′ , H ′) ≺ (E, H). Clearly, if (E1 , H1 ) ∼ (E, H)
and (E, H) ≻ (E ′ , H ′ ), then (E1 , H1 ) ≻ (E ′ , H ′); and if (E2 , H2 ) ∼ (E ′ , H ′) and
(E, H) ≻ (E ′ , H ′), then (E, H) ≻ (E2 , H2 ).
    Proposition 1. (E, H) ≻ (E ′ , H ′) if and only if (E ′ , H ′ ) is a subfactor of (E, H).
In particular, the relation ≻ is a partial order on the set of all Kronecker representa-
tions.

                                                is an epimorphism. Thus (E ′ , H ′ ) is a sub-

subrepresentation (E1 , H1 ) of (E, H) such that (E ′ , H ′) is a factor representation of
(E1 , H1 ). Hence, there are full rank matrices Ai , Bi , i = 1, 2, and A′1 , B2′ such that
(E, H)A2 = B2 (E1 , H1 ), (E ′ , H ′)A1 = B1 (E1 , H1 ), A1 A′1 = I, and B2′ B2 = I. Since
B1 B2′ and A2 A′1 are full rank matrices, there exist    invertible

1.2    Reduction to the Subrepresentation Case
Once we find a sufficient and necessary condition C(N , M) for a Kronecker representa-
tion N to be a subrepresentation of another Kronecker representation M in terms of the
Kronecker invariants N and M of N and M, then dually we will find a sufficient and
necessary condition C ∗ (M, N ) for N to be a factor representation of M. Furthermore,
we will find a sufficient and necessary condition for N to be a subfactor of M: There
exists a Kronecker module L of Kronecker invariants L such that conditions C(L, M)
and C ∗ (L, N ) are satisfied. Therefore the question is reduced from the subfactor one
to one of the subrepresentation.
   Remark. The existence question in the condition is not very easy to handle, but it
seems difficult to avoid. Indeed, existence question also appear in the results of [3, 4, 5].


1.3    Extension of the Underlying Field
Though the question is posed on the field of real numbers R, we may consider the
question on the field of complex numbers C:
   Proposition 2. A real Kronecker representation (E ′ , H ′ ) is a subrepresentation of
another real Kronecker representation (E, H) over R if and only if the same is the case
over C.
    Proof. The necessity is trivial. It remains to consider sufficiency. First, there are
full column rank complex matrices P and Q such that QE ′ = EP and QH ′ = HP .
Second, √let P = P1 + iP2 and Q = Q1 + iQ2 with Pj , Qj , j = 1, 2, being real matrices
and i = −1. Then we have Qj E ′ = EPj and Qj H ′ = HPj for j = 1, 2. Since P (resp.
Q) is of full column rank, P1 = P2 = 0 (resp. Q1 = Q2 = 0) can not occur. Hence
P1 + xP2 (resp. Q1 + xQ2 ) is of smaller rank than P (resp. Q) for only finitely many
values x in C, i.e., the common roots of all rank P (resp. rank Q)–minors of P1 + xP2
(resp. Q1 + xQ2 ). Consequently there is some value x0 in R such that P1 + x0 P2 and
Q1 + x0 Q2 are of full column rank, and (P1 + x0 P2 , Q1 + x0 Q2 ) is a monomorphism
from (E ′ , H ′ ) to (E, H).                                                           ✷
   And more generally, we are able to consider the problem over an arbitrary alge-
braically closed field K. By extension of the underlying field we can simply express
Kronecker invariants as a set of integers (see section 2.1 below), this is of great benefit.


2      Homomorphisms between two Kronecker Rep-
      resentations
Note that a homomorphism between two Kronecker representations is just a pair of
matrices satisfying two equations. In this section we partition these two matrices in

                                             5
the natural way (corresponding to their direct sum decompositions of indecomposable
representations) and observe the form of every block.


2.1     Kronecker Invariants
Denote by I the identity matrix and by J the Jordan block with eigenvalue 0 (of the
appropriate size). Denote by P1 (K) the projective line over K. By the well-known Krull-
Schmidt theorem, a Kronecker representation can be decomposedinto a direct                   sum of
                                                                        i−1     i    I     0
indecomposable Kronecker representations. Let Qi := (K , K ; 0 , I ), R∞,i :=
(Ki , Ki ; J, I), Rp,i := (Ki , Ki ; I, pI + J), and Ji := (Ki , Ki−1 ; [ I 0 ], [ 0 I ]), p ∈ K, i ∈
N1 := {1, 2, ...}. Then the sets {Qi |i ∈ N1 }, {Rp,i |p ∈ P1 (K), i ∈ N1 } and {Ji |i ∈ N1 },
called preprojective, regular, and preinjective indecomposable Kronecker representa-
tions respectively, constitute a complete set of nonisomorphic indecomposable Kro-
necker representations [1]. Up to isomorphism, a Kronecker representation M can be
                                       P                       mp                 mI
uniquely written as M = (⊕m          i=1 Qai ) ⊕ (⊕p∈P1 (K) ⊕i=1 Rp,bi ) ⊕ (⊕i=1 Jci ) for some pos-
                                                                       p

itive integers ai , i = 1, ..., mP ; bpi , i = 1, ..., mp , p ∈ P1 (K); ci , i = 1, ..., mI (notice that
the superscripts do not mean power). The Kronecker representation M is uniquely
determined by ai , bpi , ci , which are called the Kronecker invariants of M. Moreover, a
Kronecker representation is said to be preprojective (resp. regular, preinjective) if it is
the direct sum of preprojective (resp. regular, preinjective) indecomposable represen-
tations.
    Remark. Usually the Kronecker invariants of M viewed as a matrix pencil are re-
ferred to the row minimal indices, the infinite elementary factors, the finite elementary
factors, and the column minimal indices [6, 7]. Over an algebraically closed field K,
                                                p
they correspond to positive integers ai , b∞
                                           i , bi (p ∈ K), ci respectively.

M P (β) and N P (β) are of the form diag{ 0I , . . . , I0 }. We can write φP P = (φP P 1, φP P 2)
                                                                  

way (corresponding to their direct sum decomposition), we have φP P 1 = (φPijP 1 )ij and
φP P 2 = (φPijP 2 )ij , i = 1, ..., mP , j = 1, ..., nP . Since M P (α)φP P 1 = φP P 2N P (α) and
M P (β)φP P 1 = φP P 2N P (β), we have I0 φPijP 1 = φPijP 2 I0 and 0I φPijP 1 = φPijP 2 0I .

3       Subrepresentations of Kronecker Representations
Assume that N ′ and M ′ are preprojective (resp. regular, or preinjective) Kronecker
representations. In this section we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for N ′ to
be a subrepresentation of M ′ in terms of their Kronecker invariants. For convenience,
we consider the preprojective (resp. regular, or preinjective) parts of the Kronecker
modules N and M given in section 2.2 instead of N ′ and M ′ .
   A generic matrix is a matrix whose elements are pairwise different indeterminates.
A matrix pair φ = (φ1 , φ2 ) is called a generic homomorphism from N to M if φ1
and φ2 are generic matrices satisfying M(α)φ1 = φ2 N(α) and M(β)φ1 = φ2 N(β).
Clearly, a generic homomorphism from N to M is a homomorphism from N to M
over some transcendental extension field of K. Once the indeterminates in the generic


                                                      8
homomorphism φ take special values in K then φ becomes a homomorphism from N to
M. Conversely, any homomorphism from N to M can be obtained in this way. From
now on φ = (φ1 , φ2 ) is always assumed to be a generic homomorphism from N to M.
Clearly, N is a subrepresentation of M if and only if there exists a monomorphism
from N to M, or if and only if the generic homomorphism φ = (φ1 , φ2 ) from N to
M is a monomorphism over some rational function field over K, or if and only if φ1
and φ2 viewed as matrices over the polynomial rings, equivalently over their quotient
fields, are of full column ranks. If we partition φ as done in section 2.2 and partition
φSSh, S ∈ {P, R, I}, h ∈ {1, 2}, as done in section 2.3 and section 2.4, then the blocks
in φSSh have the forms (1), (2) or (3) in sections 2.3 and 2.4 where all x∗∗ are assumed
to be indeterminates. Thus N S is a subrepresentation of M S if and only if φSS1 and
φSS2 are of full column rank. In order to determine when φSS1 and φSS2 are of full
column rank, we calculate the ranks of φSS1 and φSS2 .


3.1    Generalization and Specialization
In order to calculate the ranks of the matrices φSS1 and φSS2, we employ the general-
ization and specialization approach. The generalization procedure consists of replacing
some elements in the matrix of rational functions A with new independent indetermi-
nates, so that the rank of the resulting matrix of rational functions provides an upper
bound for the rank of the original matrix A. The specialization procedure consists of
replacing some indeterminates in A with special values, usually 0 or 1, so that the rank
of the resulting matrix provides a lower bound for the rank of the original matrix A.
Usually, by a series elementary transformations of matrices and generalizations, we can
obtain a matrix of rational functions B from A, and by specialization we can obtain
a matrix C from A. It will be shown that rank B = rank C. Thus we conclude that
rank A = rank B = rank C. In the following we will apply this approach to calculate
the ranks of φSS1 and φSS2.
    First we calculate the ranks of block upper triangular generic matrices by the
generalization-specialization approach. The rank formula obtained is closely related
to the rank formula obtained in the preprojective-to-preprojective and preinjective-to-
preinjective cases (see the remarks in section 3.3 and section 3.4 below).
   Proposition 3. Let A = (Aij )ij with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ q be a block upper triangular
generic matrix, i.e., Aij = 0 for 1 ≤ j < i ≤ q and Aij is ri × cj generic matrix for
1 ≤ iP≤ j ≤ q.PAssume that all indeterminates in A are different. Then rank A =
min{ ij=1 rj + qj=i+1 cj |0 ≤ i ≤ q}.
   Remark. By convention we require ij=k yj = 0 if i < k.
                                        P

   Proof. Let F be the transcendental extension field of K obtained by adding all
indeterminates in A, i.e., the field of rational functions in all indeterminates in A over

K. We proceed by induction on q: It is trivial for case q = 1. Now consider the case
q ≥ 2.
     If r1 ≤ c1 then by elementary transformations over F , A can be reduced to another
block upper triangular matrix A′ = (A′ij )ij , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ q, where A′ij = 0 for 1 ≤ j <
i ≤ q, A′11 = [I, 0] and I is the r1 × r1 identity matrix, and A′1j = 0 for 2 ≤ j ≤ q with
A′ij = Aij for 2 ≤ i ≤ q. By our induction hypothesis, rank A = r1 + min{ ij=2 rj +
                                                                                            P

   j=i+1 cj |1 ≤ i ≤ q} = min{          j=1 rj +       j=i+1 cj |0 ≤ i ≤ q}.
     If r1 > c1 then by elementary transformations over F , A can be reduced to another
block upper triangular matrix A′ = (A′ij )ij , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ q, where A′ij = 0 for 1 ≤
j < i ≤ q, A′11 = I for the c1 × c1 identity matrix, and A′1j = 0 for 2 ≤ j ≤ q
with A′ij = Aij for 3 ≤ i ≤ q. By generalization, i.e., replacing all elements in the
(r1 + r2 − c1 ) × cj matrices A′2j , 2 ≤ j ≤ q, with different new indeterminates, we
obtain a P  matrix B. By induction        Phypothesis,       we get rank A P=   rank A′ ≤ rank B =
               q                              q                              q

   j=3 rj } = min{    j=1 rj +       j=i+1 cj |0 ≤ i ≤ q}. On the other hand, by specialization,
i.e., taking the (1, 1), (2, 2), · · · , (c1 , c1 ) entries of A to be 1 and all other indeterminates
lying in the same rows or columns as these entries as 0. The resulting matrix C clearly
has the same rank P as B. ThusP rank A ≥ rank C = rank B. Finally rank A = rank C =
rank B = min{ ij=1 rj + qj=i+1 cj |0 ≤ i ≤ q}.                                                     ✷


3.2     The Preprojective to Preprojective Case
Keeping in mind the analysis of φP P in section 2.3, let

                             r1 := max{1 ≤ j ≤ nP |dj > a1 };
                             s1 := max{1 ≤ i ≤ mP |dr1 +1 ≤ ai };
                             ...
                             rl := max{1 ≤ j ≤ nP |dj > asl−1 +1 };
                             sl := max{1 ≤ i ≤ mP |drl +1 ≤ ai };
                             ...
                             rt = nP .

Note that r1 is just the number of zero blocks in the first block row of φP P 2, s1 is just
the number of the block rows of φP P 2 having the largest number of nonzero blocks. In
the following all undefined numbers such as s0 are assumed to be 0.

     Proceeding in this way, this process will end with one of two possibilities:
     (i) we can proceed in 2st−1 steps: In this case all nonzero rows are exhausted.
     (ii) we can proceed in 2q − 1 steps with 1 ≤ q ≤ st−1 : In this case all nonzero
columns are exhausted.

     ViaPour specializations we have obtained a (0,1)-matrix whose rank is                        j=1 aj

by elementary
          P t−1 transformations      to a (0,1)-matrix for which in case (i) (resp. (ii)) there
are just sj=1     aj (resp. rj=r

1, we have rank A = j=1 aj . By the induction hypothesis, the rank of the subma-
trix B := φP P 2( sj=1     aj + 1, ..., sj=1    aj ; rj=1    dj + 1, ..., rj=1  dj ) of φP P 2 is equal

    Note that r1 = max{1 ≤ j ≤ nP |dj −1 > a1 −1}; s1 = max{1 ≤ i ≤ mP |dr1 +1 −1 ≤
ai −1}; ... ; rl = max{1 ≤ j ≤ nP |dj −1 > asl−1 +1 −1}; sl = max{1 ≤ i ≤ mP |drl +1 −1 ≤

    Corollary 5. rank φP P 1 = min{ sj=1   (aj − 1) + rj=r

   Remark. By Proposition 4, Corollary 5, and Proposition 3 we find that rank φP P h ,
h ∈ {1, 2}, is equal to the rank of the matrix obtained from φP P h by replacing each
nonzero block in φP P h with a generic matrix of the same size. (Of course all indeter-
minates in these generic matrices are assumed to be different.)
   By Proposition 4 and Corollary 5 we obtain a numerical criterion for a preprojective
Kronecker representation to be a subrepresentation of another preprojective Kronecker
representation in terms of their Kronecker invariants.

3.3     The Preinjective to Preinjective Case
Keep in mind the analysis of φII in section 2.3. Let
                             u1 := max{1 ≤ j ≤ mI |cj > f1 };
                             v1 := max{1 ≤ i ≤ nI |cu1 +1 ≤ fi };
                             ···
                             ul := max{1 ≤ j ≤ mI |cj > fvl−1 +1 };
                             vl := max{1 ≤ i ≤ nI |cul +1 ≤ fi };
                             ···
                             uw = mI .

                                                 12
Note that u1 is just the number of the zero blocks in the first block column of φII1 , v1
is just the number of the block columns of φII1 having the largest number of nonzero
blocks. Dual to Proposition 4 and Corollary 5 we have:
    Proposition 7. rank φII1 = min{ vj=1    fj + uj=u
                                      Pi         P w
                                                              c |0 ≤ i ≤ w − 1}.
                                                       i+1 +1 j

    Corollary 8. rank φII2 = min{ vj=1   (fj − 1) + uj=u
                                    P               P
                                       i                w
                                                           i+1 +1
                                                                  (cj − 1)|0 ≤ i ≤ w − 1}.
    Remark. By Proposition 7, Corollary 8, and Proposition 3 we find that rank φIIh , h ∈
{1, 2}, is equal to the rank of the matrix obtained from φIIh by replacing each nonzero
block in φIIh with a generic matrix of the same size.
   Theorem 9.P N I is a subrepresentation           I
                                               of M P if and only if vw−1 = vw =
n , j=vi +1 fj ≤ j=ui+1 +1 cj and j=vi +1 (fj − 1) ≤ uj=u
 I  vw−1         uw               vw−1

                                                          i+1 +1
                                                                 (cj − 1), 0 ≤ i ≤ w − 2.


3.4      The Regular to Regular Case
This case is easier.
                                                    Pmin{mp ,np }
      Proposition 10. rank φRRh =                                 min{bp , ep }, h ∈ {1, 2}.
                                       P
                                         p∈P1 (K)       i=1              i   i

    Proof. Keep in mind the analysis of φ in section 2.4. For every p ∈ P1 (K) and
                                                 RR

every h ∈ {1, 2} we keep the first nonzero element in each row of the matrices φRRhp       11
and use it to eliminate all other entries in φRRhp which lie in the same row or column
by elementary transformations over the transcendental extension field F of K obtained
by adding all indeterminates in φRRh . Next keep the first nonzero element in each row
of the matrices φRRhp
                   22  , and use them to eliminate all other elements in φRRhp which
lie in the same row or column by elementary transformations over F . Proceeding in
                                                Pmin{mp ,np }
this way, after min{mp , np } steps, we obtain i=1             min{bpi , epi } nonzero elements
which lie in different rows and different columns of φRRhp , while all other entries in
                                                     Pmin{mp ,np }
φRRhp are reduced to 0. Thus rank φRRhp =              i=1         min{bpi , epi }. Furthermore
                        Pmin{mp ,np }
rank φRRh =                           min{bp , ep }, h ∈ {1, 2}.
              P
                 p∈P1 (K)       i=1          i      i                                         ✷
      Theorem 11. N is a subrepresentation of M R if and only if mp ≥ np and
                            R

bpi   ≥ epi , p ∈ P1 (K), 1 ≤ i ≤ np .
   Remark. In the same way, one can show that N P is a subrepresentation of M I if
           P I              P nP
and only if mi=1 (ci − 1) ≥   i=1 di . However, to solve the problem completely, i.e., for
arbitrary Kronecker representations N and M, more analysis is needed.
