                                                 functions on a reductive symmetric space is studied. The family parameter
                                                 is a complex character on the split component of a parabolic subgroup.

Introduction
In harmonic analysis on a reductive symmetric space X an important role is
played by families of generalized eigenfunctions for the algebra D(X) of invariant
differential operators. Such families arise for instance as matrix coefficients of
representations that come in series, such as the (generalized) principal series.
In particular, relations between such families are of great interest. We recall
that a real reductive group G, equipped with the left times right multiplication
action, is a reductive symmetric space. In the case of the group, examples of
the mentioned relations are functional equations for Eisenstein integrals, see
[23] and [25], or Arthur-Campoli relations for Eisenstein integrals, see [1], [14].
In this paper we develop a general tool to establish relations of this kind. We
show that they can be derived from similar relations satisfied by the family of
functions obtained by taking one particular coefficient in a certain asymptotic
expansion. Since the functions in the family so obtained are eigenfunctions on
symmetric spaces of lower split rank, this yields a powerful inductive method; we
call it induction of relations. In the case of the group, a closely related lifting
theorem by Casselman was used by Arthur in the proof of the Paley-Wiener
theorem, see [1], Thm. II.4.1. However, no proof seems yet to have appeared of
Casselman’s theorem.
    The tools developed in this paper are used in [11], and they will also be
applied in the forthcoming papers [12] and [13]. For example, it is the induction
of relations that allows us to establish symmetry properties of certain integral
kernels appearing in a Fourier inversion formula in [11]. Also in [11], the induc-
tion of relations is used to define generalized Eisenstein integrals corresponding
to non-minimal principal series. In [12], the results of this paper will be applied
to identify these ‘formal’ Eisenstein integrals with those defined in Delorme [18].
This is a key step towards the Plancherel decomposition. The results will also
be applied to establish functional equations for the Eisenstein integrals. Ap-
plied in this manner our technique serves as a replacement for the use of the
Maass-Selberg relations as in Harish-Chandra [25] and [18]. On the other hand,
in [13] we apply our tool to show that Arthur-Campoli relations satisfied by
normalized Eisenstein integrals of spaces of lower split rank induce similar rela-
tions for normalized Eisenstein integrals of X. This result is then used to prove a
Paley-Wiener theorem for X that generalizes Arthur’s theorem for the group. In



                                        2
particular, the missing proof of Casselman’s theorem will then be circumvented
by means of a technique of the present paper.
    It should be mentioned that in the case of the group, induction of Arthur-
Campoli relations for unnormalized Eisenstein integrals is easily derived from
their integral representations (see [1], p. 77, proof of Lemma 2.3). For normalized
Eisenstein integrals, which are not representable by integrals, the result seems
to be much deeper, also in the group case.
    One of the interesting features of the theory is that it also deals with families
of functions that are not necessarily globally defined on the space X but on a
suitable open dense subset.
    Asymptotic behavior of eigenfunctions on a symmetric space has been stud-
ied at many other places in the literature. The following papers hold results
that are related to some of the ideas of the present paper [22], [20], [32], [24],
[25], [26], [28], [30], [17], [33], [1], [29], [6], [15].
    The core results of this paper were found and announced in the fall of 1995,
when both authors were guests at the Mittag-Leffler Institute. In the same
period Delorme announced his proof of the Plancherel theorem, which has now
appeared in [19].
    We shall now explain the contents of this paper in more detail. The space
X is of the form G/H, with G a real reductive Lie group of Harish-Chandra’s
class, and H an open subgroup of the set of fixed points for an involution σ
of G.
    The group G has a σ-stable maximal compact subgroup K, let θ be the
associated Cartan involution of G. Let P0 = M0 A0 N0 be a fixed minimal σ ◦ θ-
invariant parabolic subgroup of G, with the indicated Langlands decomposition.
The Lie algebra a0 of A0 is invariant under the infinitesimal involution σ; we
denote the associated −1 eigenspace in a0 by aq . Its dimension is called the split
rank of X. Let Aq be the vectorial subgroup of G with Lie algebra aq and let
Areg
   q be the set of regular points relative to the adjoint action of Aq in g. Then
X+ := KAreg                                                           +
             q H is a K-invariant dense open subset of X. Let Aq be the open
chamber in Aq determined by P0 . Then X+ is a finite union of disjoint sets of
the form KA+    q vH, with v in the normalizer of aq in K. In this introduction
we assume, for simplicity of exposition, that X+ = KA+      q H. This assumption is
actually fulfilled in the case that X is a group.
    Let (τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional continuous representation of K. Then
by C ∞ (X+ : τ ) we denote the space of smooth functions f : X+ → Vτ that are
τ -spherical, i.e., f (kx) = τ (k)f (x), for all x ∈ X+ and k ∈ K.
    Let Pσ denote the (finite) set of σ ◦ θ-invariant parabolic subgroups of G
containing Aq . Let Q = MQ AQ NQ be an element of Pσ . Then σ restricts to an
involution of aQ , the Lie algebra of AQ ; we denote its −1 eigenspace by aQq .
In the first part of the paper we study a family f of the following type (cf.
Definition 7.1). The family is a smooth map of the form
                                 f : Ω × X+ → Vτ ,
with Ω an open subset of a∗QqC , the complexified linear dual of aQq . It is assumed
that f is holomorphic in its first variable. Moreover, for every λ ∈ Ω the

                                         3
function fλ : = f (λ, · ) belongs to C ∞ (X+ : τ ). It is furthermore assumed that
the functions fλ allow suitable exponential polynomial expansions along A+       q.
More precisely, we assume, for m ∈ M0 and a ∈ A+       q , that
                    X                     X
      fλ (ma) =            asλ−ρP0                    a−ξ qs,ξ (λ, log a, m). (0.1)
                 s∈W/WQ             ξ∈−sWQ Y +NΣ(P0 )

Here W is the Weyl group of Σ = Σ(g, aq ) and WQ is the centralizer of aQq
in W. Moreover, Σ(P0 ) denotes the collection of roots from Σ occurring in N0
and Y is a finite subset of ∗ a∗QqC , the annihilator of aQq in a∗qC . Finally, the qs,ξ
are smooth functions, holomorphic in the first and polynomial in the second
variable. Thus, we impose a limitation on the set of exponents and assume
that the coefficients depend holomorphically on the parameter λ. The type of
convergence that we impose on the expansion (0.1) is described in general terms
in the preliminary Section 1.
    We show that the functions fλ actually allow exponential polynomial expan-
sions similar to (0.1) along any (possibly non-minimal) P ∈ Pσ . These expan-
sions are investigated in detail in Sections 3 and 7. Their coefficients are families
of τ |MP ∩K -spherical functions on XP,+ , the analogue of X+ for the lower split
rank symmetric space XP : = MP /MP ∩ H.
    The operators from D(X) do also allow expansions along every P ∈ Pσ .
In Section 4 this is shown by investigating a radial decomposition that reflects
the decomposition G = KMP AP q H. It is of importance that the coefficients in
these expansions are globally defined smooth functions on MP , see Prop. 4.10
and Cor. 4.9. From the expansions we derive that the algebra D(X) acts on the
space of families of the above type, see Prop. 7.6.
    In Section 8 we introduce the notion of asymptotic s-globality of a family
along P. Losely speaking, it means that the coefficients qs,ξ (λ, log a, · ) of the
expansion along P extend smoothly from XP,+ to the full space XP , for every
ξ ∈ (sWQ Y − NΣ(P ))|aP q . This notion is proved to be stable under the action
of D(X).
    In Section 9 we impose three other conditions on the family. The first is that
each member satisfies a system of differential equations of the form
                              Dfλ = 0          (D ∈ Iδ,λ ).
Here Iδ,λ is a certain cofinite ideal in the algebra D(X) depending polynomially
on λ ∈ a∗QqC in a suitable way. Accordingly, λ is called the spectral parameter of
the family. The second condition imposed is a suitable condition of asymptotic
globality along certain parabolic subgroups P with dim(aq /aP q ) = 1. Thirdly,
it is required that the domain Ω for the parameter λ is unbounded in certain
directions (see Defn. 9.9).
    The first main result of the paper is then the following vanishing theorem,
see Theorem 9.10.
The vanishing theorem. Let f be a family as above, and assume that the
coefficient of λ − ρQ in the expansion along Q vanishes for λ in a non-empty
open subset of Ω. Then the family f is identically zero.

                                           4
    In the proof the globality assumption is needed to link suitably many asymp-
totic coefficients together; the vanishing of one of them then inductively causes
the vanishing of others. In the induction step a key role is played by the obser-
vation that a symmetric space cannot have a continuum of discrete series.
    The importance of the vanishing theorem is that it applies to many families
that naturally arise in representation theory. In the present paper we show
that this is so for Eisenstein integrals associated with the minimal principal
series for X; in [12] we will show that Eisenstein integrals obtained by parabolic
induction from discrete series form a family of the above type. The idea is that
the latter Eisenstein integrals can be obtained from those associated with the
minimal principal series by the application of residual operators with respect to
the spectral parameter. Such residual operators occur in our papers [10] and
[11].
    A suitable class of operators containing the residual operators is formed by
the Laurent operators. In the second half of the paper we study the applica-
tion of them to suitable families of eigenfunctions, with respect to the spectral
parameter. The Laurent operators are best described by means of Laurent
functionals, see Sections 10 and 11.
    In Section 12 we introduce a special type of families g of eigenfunctions. It is
of the above type, with Ω dense in a∗P qC , P a minimal parabolic subgroup in Pσ ,
and satisfies some additional requirements, see Definition 12.8. One of these is
that the family and its asymptotic expansions should depend meromorphically
on the spectral parameter λ ∈ a∗P qC with singularities along translated root
hyperplanes. This allows the application of Laurent functionals with respect
to the spectral parameter. More precisely, let Q ∈ Pσ contain P, and let L
be a Laurent functional on ∗ a∗QqC . From the family g a new family f = L∗ g,
with a spectral parameter from a∗QqC , is obtained by the application of L to the
∗ ∗
 aQqC -component of the spectral parameter. In Theorem 13.12 it is shown that
the resulting family L∗ g satisfies the requirements of the vanishing theorem,
provided the special family g satisfies certain holomorphic asymptotic globality
conditions.
    In Section 14 we introduce partial Eisenstein integrals associated with a min-
imal parabolic subgroup P from Pσ . The partial Eisenstein integrals are spher-
ical generalized eigenfunctions on X+ obtained from the normalized Eisenstein
integral E ◦ (P : λ), (λ ∈ a∗qC generic), by splitting it according to its exponential
polynomial expansion along P. More precisely, the exponents of E ◦ (P : λ) are
contained in W λ − ρP − NΣ(P ); the partial Eisenstein integrals E+,s (P : λ), for
s ∈ W, are the smooth spherical functions on X+ determined by the require-
ments that                                 X
                            E ◦ (P : λ) =      E+,s (P : λ)
                                         s∈W

and the set of exponents of E+,s (P : λ) along P should be contained in sλ−ρP −
NΣ(P ). It is then shown that the partial Eisenstein integrals yield examples of
the special families mentioned above. Moreover, if Q ∈ Pσ , Q ⊃ P, let W Q be
the collection of minimal length (with respect to Σ(P )) coset representatives for


                                          5
W/WQ in W. Then it is shown that for each t ∈ WQ the family
                              X
                         ft =       E+,st (P : · )                            (0.2)
                                   s∈W Q

satisfies the additional holomorphic asympotic globality property guaranteeing
that L∗ ft satisfies the hypothesis of the vanishing theorem, for L a Laurent
functional on ∗ a∗QqC .
    In Section 15 the asymptotic behavior of L∗ ft is investigated, and the co-
efficient of aλ−ρQ in the expansion along Q is expressed in terms of partial
Eisenstein integrals of XQ .
    The above preparations pave the way for the induction of relations in Section
16. The idea is as follows. Let ft be the family defined by (0.2), and let a Laurent
functional Lt on ∗ a∗QqC be
                         P given for each t ∈ WQ . Then by the vanishing theorem
a relation of the form t Lt ft = 0 is valid if a similar relation is valid for the
(λ − ρQ )-coefficients along Q; this in turn may be expressed as a similar relation
between partial Eisenstein integrals for the lower split rank space XQ . In this
setting, taking the (λ − ρQ )-coefficient along Q essentially inverts the procedure
of parabolic induction from Q to G. This motivaties our choice of terminology.
The precise result is formulated in Theorem 16.1. An equivalent result, closer to
the formulation of Casselman’s theorem in [1] is stated at the end of the section.


1    Exponential polynomial series
Let A be a vectorial group and a its Lie algebra. The exponential map exp: a →
A is a diffeomorphism; we denote its inverse by log . If ξ belongs to a∗C , the
complexified linear dual of a, then we define the function eξ : a 7→ aξ on A by
aξ = eξ(log a) . Let P (a) denote the algebra of polynomial functions a → C. If
d ∈ N, let Pd (a) denote the (finite dimensional) subspace of polynomials of
degree at most d. Let ∆ be a set of linearly independent vectors in a (we do not
require this set to span a). We put
                 a+ = a+ (∆): = {X ∈ a | α(X) > 0, ∀ α ∈ ∆},
and A+ = A+ (∆) = exp(a+ ). We define N∆ to be the N-span of ∆; if ∆ = ∅
then N∆ = {0}. Moreover, if X is a subset of a∗C , we denote by X − N∆ the
vectorial sum of X and N∆.
    Let V be a complete locally convex space; here and in the following we will
always assume such a space to be Hausdorff. If ξ ∈ a∗C , then by a V -valued
ξ-exponential polynomial function on A we mean a function A → V of the form
a 7→ aξ q(log a), with q ∈ P (a) ⊗ V.

Definition 1.1 By a ∆-exponential polynomial series on A with coefficients in
V we mean a formal series F of exponential polynomial functions of the form
                              X
                                  aξ qξ (log a),                         (1.1)
                                 ξ∈a∗

with ξ 7→ qξ a map a∗C → P (a) ⊗ V, such that
 (a) there exists a finite subset X ⊂ a∗C such that qξ = 0 for ξ ∈
                                                                 / X − N∆;
 (b) there exists a constant d ∈ N such that qξ ∈ Pd (a) ⊗ V for all ξ ∈ a∗C .
The smallest d ∈ N with property (b) will be called the polynomial degree of
the series; this number is denoted by deg(F ).
    The collection of all ∆-exponential polynomial series with coefficients in V
                              ep
is denoted by F ep (A, V ) = F∆  (A, V ).
   If F ∈ F ep (A, V ) is an expansion of the form (1.1) then, for every ξ ∈ a∗C ,
we write qξ (F ) for qξ . Moreover, we write q(F ) for the map ξ 7→ qξ (F ) from a∗C
to Pd (a) ⊗ V. Then F 7→ q(F ) defines a bijection from F ep (A, V ) onto a linear
                           ∗
subspace of (Pd (a) ⊗ V )aC , the space of maps a∗qC → Pd (a) ⊗ V. Via this bijection
we equip F ep (A, V ) with the structure of a linear space.
   If F ∈ F ep (A, V ), then

                          Exp(F ): = {ξ ∈ a∗C | qξ (F ) 6= 0}

is called the set of exponents of F. If F1 , F2 ∈ F ep (A, V ), we call F1 a subseries
of F2 if qξ (F2 ) = qξ (F1 ) for all ξ ∈ Exp(F1 ).
    The series (1.1) is said to converge absolutely in a fixed point a0 ∈ A if the
series                                X
                                           aξ0 qξ (log a0 )
                                ξ∈Exp(F )

with coefficients in V converges absolutely. It is said to converge absolutely on
a subset Ω ⊂ A if it converges absolutely in every point a0 ∈ Ω. In this case
pointwise summation of the series defines a function Ω → V.
   We will also need a more special type of convergence for the series (1.1).

Definition 1.2 The series (1.1) is said to converge neatly at a fixed point a0 ∈
A if for every continuous seminorm s on Pd (a) ⊗ V, where d = deg(F ), the series
                                 X
                                       s(qξ )aRe
                                              0
                                                 ξ

                                 ξ∈Exp(F )

converges.
   The series (1.1) is said to converge neatly on a subset Ω of A if it converges
neatly at every point of Ω.


Remark 1.3 If the series (1.1) converges neatly at a point a0 ∈ A, then so does
every subseries. Moreover, neat convergence at a0 implies absolute convergence
in a0 . However, we should warn the reader that neat convergence at a0 cannot
be seen from the series with coefficients in V arising from (1.1) by evaluation of
its terms at a = a0 , since this type of convergence involves the global behavior
of the polynomials qξ . In particular, it is possible that the series (1.1) does not
converge neatly at a0 , whereas its evaluation in a0 is identically zero.

                                             7
    The motivation for the definition of neat convergence is provided later      by
Lemmas 1.5 and 1.9, which express that neat convergence of the series (1.1)      on
an open subset Ω ⊂ A guarantees that (a) the function f : Ω → V defined          by
(1.1) is real analytic on Ω; (b) its derivatives are given by series obtained    by
termwise differentiation from (1.1).
   By a ∆-power series on A, with coefficients in V, we mean a ∆-exponential
polynomial series F with deg F = 0 and Exp(F ) ⊂ −N∆, i.e.,
                                    X
                              F =        aξ cξ ,                       (1.2)
                                      ξ∈−N∆

with cξ ∈ V, for ξ ∈ −N∆. Note that for a ∆-power series the notion of neat
convergence at a point a0 ∈ A coincides with the notion of absolute convergence
in the point a0 .
    The terminology ‘power
                       P series’ is motivated by the following consideration.
If µ ∈ N∆, we put µ = α∈∆ µα α, with µα ∈ N. For z ∈ C∆ , we write
                                         Y
                                  zµ =         zαµα .
                                         α∈∆

Finally, to the series (1.2) we associate the power series
                                    X
                                         z µ c−µ                              (1.3)
                                   µ∈N∆

with coefficients in V.
    Let z: A → C∆ be the map defined by z(a)α = a−α . Then it is obvious that
the series (1.2) converges with sum S for a = a0 if and only if the power series
(1.3) converges with sum S for z = z(a0 ). If r ∈ ] 0, ∞ [∆ we write D(0, r) for
the polydisc in C∆ consisting of the points z with |zα | < rα for all α ∈ ∆. Note
that the preimage of this set in A under the map z is given by

                   A+ (∆, r): = {a ∈ A | a−α < rα , ∀ α ∈ ∆}.

If R > 0, we also agree to write A+ (∆, R) for A+ (∆, r) with r defined by rα = R
for all α ∈ ∆. Finally, if a0 ∈ A, we write A+ (∆, a0 ): = A+ (∆, z(a0 )). Thus,

              A+ (∆, a0 ): = {a ∈ A | aα > aα               +
                                            0 , ∀ α ∈ ∆} = A a0 .             (1.4)

We now note that if (1.2) converges absolutely for a = a0 , then the power
series (1.3) converges absolutely for z = z(a0 ), hence uniformly absolutely on
the closure of the polydisc D(0, z(a0 )). It follows that the series (1.2) then
converges uniformly absolutely on the closure of A+ (∆, a0 ).
    Let a0 ∈ A. By O(A+ (∆, a0 ), V ) we denote the space of functions f : A+ (∆, a0 ) →
V that are given by an absolutely converging series of the form (1.2). For such
a function the associated power series (1.3) converges absolutely on the polydisc



                                          8
D(0, r), with r = z(a0 ); let f˜: D(0, r) → V be the holomorphic function defined
by it. Then obviously

                     f (a) = f˜(z(a)),         (a ∈ A+ (∆, a0 )).

We see that the ∆-power series representing f ∈ O(A+ (∆, a0 ) is unique. More-
over, let O(D(0, r), V ) denote the space of holomorphic functions D(0, r) → V,
then it follows that the map

                  f 7→ f˜,   O(A+ (∆, r), V ) → O(D(0, r), V )

is a linear isomorphism.
    In particular it follows that every f ∈ O(A+ (∆, r), V ) is real analytic on
  +
A (∆, r). Moreover, its ∆-power series converges uniformly absolutely on every
set of the form A+ (∆, ρ), where ρ ∈ ] 0, ∞ [∆ , ρα < rα for all α ∈ ∆.
    If v is a real linear space, then by S(v) we denote the symmetric algebra
of its complexification vC . Via the right regular action we identify S(a) with
the algebra of invariant differential operators on A. If f ∈ O(A+ (∆, r), V ) and
u ∈ S(a), then uf belongs to O(A+ (∆, r), V ) again; its series may be obtained
from the series of f by termwise application of u.
    We now return to the more general exponential polynomial series (1.1) with
        P in V. Let d ≥ deg(F
coefficients                     P). Fix a basis Λ of a. For m ∈ NΛ we write
m =       λ∈Λ  m λ λ and |m|  =    λ mλ . For such m we define the polynomial
function X 7→ X m on a by
                                       Y
                                Xm =       λ(X)mλ .
                                         λ∈Λ

These polynomial functions with |m| ≤ d constitute a basis for Pd (a). Accord-
ingly, we may write:
                                    X
                          qξ (X) =      X m cξ,m ,                       (1.5)
                                         |m|≤d

with cξ,m ∈ V.

Lemma 1.4 The series (1.1) converges neatly on a set Ω ⊂ A if and only if for
every m ∈ NΛ with |m| ≤ d the series
                                X
                                     aξ cξ,m
                                 ξ∈Exp(F )

with coefficients in V converges absolutely for all a ∈ Ω.
Proof: This is a straightforward consequence of the definition of neat conver-
gence and the finite dimensionality of the space Pd (a).                    




                                           9
   We define a partial ordering ∆ on a∗C by

                           ξ1 ∆ ξ2 ⇐⇒ ξ2 − ξ1 ∈ N∆.                            (1.6)

Moreover, we define the relation of ∆-integral equivalence on a∗C by

                           ξ1 ∼∆ ξ2 ⇐⇒ ξ2 − ξ1 ∈ Z∆.

Let F ∈ F ep (A, V ) be as in (1.1) and have polynomial degree at most d. In
view of condition (a) of Definition 1.1, the restriction of the relation ∼∆ to the
set Exp(F ) induces a finite partition of it. Every class ω in this partition has a
least ∆ -upper bound s(ω) in a∗C . Let S = SF be the set of these upper bounds.
For every s ∈ S and every m ∈ NΛ with |m| ≤ d we define the ∆-power series
                                       X
                           fs,m (a) =       a−µ cs−µ,m ,                      (1.7)
                                       µ∈N∆

with coefficients determined by (1.5).

Lemma 1.5 Let the series (1.1) be neatly convergent at the point a0 ∈ A. Then
the series (1.1) and, for every s ∈ S = SF and m ∈ NΛ with |m| ≤ d, the series
(1.7) is neatly convergent on the closure of the set A+ (∆, a0 ). The functions fs,m ,
defined by (1.7), belong to O(A+ (∆, a0 ), V ). Moreover, let f : A+ (∆, a0 ) → V
be the function defined by the summation of (1.1). Then
                       X
               f (a) =      as (log a)m fs,m (a),    (a ∈ A+ (∆, a0 )).         (1.8)
                       s∈S
                      |m|≤d



In particular, the function f : A+ (∆, a0 ) → V is real analytic.
Proof: From the neat convergence
                              P       of (1.1) at a0 it follows by Lemma 1.4 that
for every s and m the series µ∈N∆ as−µ cs−µ,m converges absolutely for a = a0 .
This implies that the ∆-power series (1.7) converges absolutely for a = a0 . Hence
it converges (uniformly) absolutely on the closure of A+ (∆, a0 ); in particular it
converges neatly on that set. It follows from this that fs,m ∈ O(A+ (∆, a0 ), V ),
for s ∈ S and m ∈ NΛ with |m| ≤ d. Moreover,
                                          X
                    as (log a)m fs,m =          aξ (log a)m cξ,m              (1.9)
                                         ξ∈s−N∆

where the ∆-exponential polynomial series on the right-hand side converges
neatly on the closure of A+ (∆, a0 ). The series (1.9), for s ∈ S and m ∈ NΛ with
|m| ≤ d add up to the series (1.1), which is therefore neatly convergent as well.
Moreover, (1.8) follows. This in turn implies the real analyticity of the function
f.                                                                               




                                         10
Remark 1.6 Let a∆ : = ∩α∈∆ ker α and A∆ : = exp(a∆ ). Then the functions
fs,m , defined by (1.7) satisfy fs,m (aa∆ ) = fs,m (a) for all a ∈ A, a∆ ∈ A∆ .
In particular, the function f of (1.8) generates a finite dimensional A∆ -module
with respect to the right regular action. Thus, if ∆ = ∅, then f is an exponential
polynomial function.


Lemma 1.7 (Uniqueness of asymptotics) Let a0 ∈ A, and assume that the ∆-
exponential polynomial series (1.1) converges neatly on A+ (∆, a0 ). If the sum
of the series is zero for all a ∈ A+ (∆, a0 ), then qξ = 0 for all ξ ∈ a∗C .
Proof: Let f : A+ (∆, a0 ) → V be defined by summation of the series (1.1).
Then it follows from Lemma 1.5 that the series (1.1) is an asymptotic expansion
for f in the sense of [6], Sect. 3. Hence, if f = 0, then by uniqueness of
asymptotics, see [22], p. 305, Cor. and [6], Prop. 3.1, it follows that the series
vanishes identically.                                                           


Definition 1.8 Let a0 ∈ A. By C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ) we denote the space of func-
tions f : A+ (∆, a0 ) → V that are given by the summation of a (necessarily
unique) neatly converging ∆-exponential polynomial series of the form (1.1).
    If f ∈ C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ), then by ep(f ) we denote the unique series from
  ep
F (A, V ) whose summation gives f. Moreover, the asymptotic degree of f is
defined to be the number

                              dega (f ): = deg(ep(f )).

   Note that the map

                      ep: C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ) → F ep (A, V ),

defined above, is a linear embedding.
    Let f ∈ C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ). We briefly write Exp(f ) for the set Exp(ep(f ));
its elements are called the exponents of f. We put qξ (f, · ): = qξ (ep(f ), · ), for
ξ ∈ a∗C . Then ξ ∈ Exp(f ) ⇐⇒ qξ (f ) 6= 0.
    The ∆ -maximal elements in Exp(f ) are called the (∆-)leading exponents
of f (or of the expansion). The set of these is denoted by ExpL (f ).
    By the formal application of S(a) to F ep (A, V ) we shall mean the linear map

                         S(a) ⊗ F ep (A, V ) → F ep (A, V )

induced by termwise differentiation (recall that S(a) acts on C ∞ (A) via the
right regular action). The image of an element u ⊗ F under this map will be
denoted by uF.




                                         11
Lemma 1.9 Let a0 ∈ A and let f ∈ C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ). If u ∈ S(a) then the
function uf : a 7→ Ru f (a) belongs to C ep (A+ (∆, a0 ), V ). Moreover,

                                ep(uf ) = u ep(f ).

Proof: We may assume that u ∈ a. Express f as in (1.8). For each s, m
the function ufs,m belongs to O(A+ (∆, a0 ), V ); its expansion is obtained from
ep(fs,m ) by termwise application of u, hence by the formal application of u. 

    We shall also need a second type of formal application. Suppose that com-
plete locally convex spaces U and W are given, and a continous bilinear map
U × V → W, denoted by (u, v) 7→ uv. By the formal application of F ep (A, U )
to F ep (A, V ) we mean the linear map

                     F ep (A, U ) ⊗ F ep (A, V ) → F ep (A, W ),

given by
   X                   X                  X    X
       aξ pξ (log a) ⊗   aη qη (log a) 7→   aν   pξ (log a)qη (log a).     (1.10)
  ξ∈a∗
     C
                     η∈a∗
                        q                 ν∈a∗
                                             C    ξ+η=ν


This map is indeed well defined. To see this, let F denote the first series and G
the second. Then for every ν ∈ a∗qC , the collection Sν of (ξ, η) ∈ Exp(F )×Exp(G)
with ξ + η = ν is finite. Hence the W -valued polynomial function
                                       X
                          rν : X 7→          pξ (X)qη (X)
                                    (ξ,η)∈Sν


has degree at most deg(F )+ deg(G). Moreover, let X1 , X2 ⊂ a∗C be finite subsets
such that Exp(F ) ⊂ X1 − N∆ and Exp(G) ⊂ X2 − N∆ and put X = X1 + X2 .
Then for ν ∈ a∗C \ [X − N∆] the collection Sν is empty, hence rν = 0. Therefore,
the formal series on the right-hand side of (1.10) satisfies the conditions of
Definition 1.1.
   The image of an element F ⊗ G under the map (1.10) is denoted by F G.
Again we have a lemma relating the formal application with neat convergence.

Lemma 1.10 Let U × V → W, (u, v) 7→ uv be a continuous bilinear map of
complete locally convex spaces. Let a0 ∈ A and let f ∈ C ep (A(∆, a0 ), U )
and g ∈ C ep (A(∆, a0 ), V ). Then the function f g: a 7→ f (a)g(a) belongs to
C ep (A(∆, a0 ), W ). Moreover, its ∆-exponential polynomial expansion is given
by
                              ep(f g) = ep(f ) ep(g).

Proof: This follows by a straightforward application of Lemma 1.5.              

2    Basic notation, spherical functions
In this section we study spherical functions that are defined on a certain open
dense subset X+ of the symmetric space X, and are (radially) given by expo-
nential polynomial series. This class of functions will play an important role in
the paper. Later we will see that D(X)-finite spherical funtions belong to this
class.
    Throughout this paper, we assume that X is a reductive symmetric space of
Harish-Chandra’s class, i.e., X = G/H with G a real reductive group of Harish-
Chandra’s class and H an open subgroup of Gσ , the group of fixed points for an
involution σ of G. There exists a Cartan involution θ of G, commuting with σ.
The associated fixed point group K is a σ-stable maximal compact subgroup.
    We adopt the usual convention to denote Lie groups by Roman capitals and
their Lie algebras by the corresponding Gothic lower cases. The infinitesimal
involutions θ and σ of g commute; let

                                g=k⊕p=h⊕q                                     (2.1)

be the associated decompositions into +1 and −1 eigenspaces for θ and σ,
respectively. We equip g with a positive definite inner product h · , · i that
is invariant under the compact group of automorphisms generated by Ad(K),
eiad (p) , θ and σ. Then the decompositions (2.1) are orthogonal.
    Let aq be a maximal abelian subspace of p∩q. We equip aq with the restricted
inner product h · , · i and its dual a∗q with the dual inner product. The latter is
extended to a complex bilinear form, also denoted h · , · i, on the complexified
dual a∗qC .
    The exponential map is a diffeomorphism from aq onto a vectorial subgroup
Aq of G. We recall that G = KAq H. Let Σ be the restricted root system of
aq in g; we recall that the associated Weyl group W is naturally isomorphic
to NK (aq )/ZK (aq ), the normalizer modulo the centralizer of aq in K. Let aregq
denote the associated set of regular elements in aq , i.e., the complement of the
union of the root hyperplanes ker α, as α ∈ Σ. We put Areg    q   := exp(areg
                                                                          q ) and
define the dense subset X+ of X by

                                 X+ = KAreg
                                        q H.

    If Q is a parabolic subgroup of G, we denote its Langlands decomposition by
Q = MQ AQ NQ . By a σ-parabolic subgroup of G we mean a parabolic subgroup
that is invariant under the composition σ ◦ θ. It follows from [4], Lemmas 2.5
and 2.6, that the collection Pσ of σ-parabolic subgroups of G containing Aq is
finite.
    If Q is a σ-parabolic subgroup then the Lie algebra aQ of its split component
is σ-stable, hence decomposes as aQ = aQh ⊕ aQq , the vector sum of the asso-
ciated +1 and −1 eigenspaces of σ|aQ , respectively. We write AQq : = exp aQq
and MQσ : = MQ (AQ ∩ H); the decomposition

                                Q = MQσ AQq NQ


                                        13
is called the σ-Langlands decomposition of Q. If Q ∈ Pσ , then M1Q = Q ∩ θ(Q)
contains Aq . Hence aQq is contained in p ∩ q and centralizes aq ; it follows that
aQq ⊂ aq . By Σ(Q) we denote the set of roots of Σ occurring in nQ . Obviously,

                                 nQ = ⊕α∈Σ(Q) gα .

   Let Pσmin denote the collection of elements of Pσ that are minimal with
respect to inclusion. An element P ∈ Pσ belongs to Pσmin if and only if aP q = aq ,
see [4], Cor. 2.7. This implies that the associated groups MP and AP are
independent of P ∈ Pσmin . We denote them by M and A, respectively. From the
maximality of aq in p ∩ q it follows that m ∩ p ⊂ h. Thus, if KM : = K ∩ M and
HM : = H ∩ M, then the inclusion map KM → M induces a diffeomorphism
                                              ≃
                            KM /KM ∩ H −→ M/HM .                                (2.2)

In particular, the symmetric space M/HM is compact.
    According to [4], Lemma 2.8, the map P 7→ Σ(P ) induces a bijective map
from Pσmin onto the collection of positive systems for Σ. If Φ is a positive system
for Σ, then the associated element P ∈ Pσmin isPgiven by the following charac-
terization of its Lie algebra: Lie (P ) = m + a + α∈Φ gα . From this we see that
NK (aq ) acts on Pσmin by conjugation; moreover, the action commutes with the
map P 7→ Σ(P ). Accordingly, the action factors to a free transitive action of W
on Pσmin , see also [4], Lemma 2.8.
    If P ∈ Pσmin, then the collection of simple roots for the positive system Σ(P )
is denoted by ∆(P ); the associated positive chamber in aq is denoted by a+     q (P )
and the corresponding chamber in Aq by A+       q (P ). Thus, we see that Areg
                                                                           q   is the
disjoint union of the chambers A+   q (P ), as P  ∈ P min
                                                      σ   .
    More generally, if Q ∈ Pσ , we write

                 a+
                  Qq : = {X ∈ aQq | α(X) > 0        for    α ∈ Σ(Q)}.           (2.3)

It follows from [4], Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6, that a+                          +
                                               Qq 6= ∅. Moreover, if X ∈ aQq ,
then the parabolic subgroup Q is determined by the following characterization
of its Lie algebra
                                            M
                         Lie (Q) = m ⊕ a ⊕       gα .                   (2.4)
                                                   α∈Σ
                                                  α(X)≥0



Conversely, if X is any element of aq , then (2.4) defines the Lie algebra of a
group Q from Pσ ; moreover, X ∈ a+Qq . From this we readily see that conjugation
induces an action of NK (aq ) on Pσ , which factors to an action of W.
   By a straightforward calculation involving root spaces, it follows that the
multiplication map K × Areg
                          q → X induces a diffeomorphism

                                                   ≃
                           K ×NK (aq )∩H Areg
                                          q   −→ X+ .



                                         14
In particular, it follows that X+ is an open dense subset of X. Let WK∩H
denote the canonical image of NK (aq ) ∩ H in W and let W be a complete set
of representatives for W/WK∩H in NK (aq ). If P ∈ Pσmin , then it follows that

               X+ = ∪w∈W KA+
                           q (P )wH                 (disjoint union).          (2.5)

Moreover, for each w ∈ W the multiplication map (k, a) 7→ kawH induces a
diffeomorphism
                                                ≃
                   K ×KM ∩wHw−1 A+           +
                                 q (P ) −→ KAq (P )wH.                         (2.6)

Here we have written KM = K ∩ M ; in (2.6) the set on the right is an open
subset of X.
   Let (τ, Vτ ) be a smooth representation of K in a complete locally convex
space. For later applications it will be crucial that we allow τ to be infinite
dimensional (see the proof of Theorem 7.7).
   By C ∞ (X+ : τ ) we denote the space of smooth functions f : X+ → Vτ that
are τ -spherical, i.e.,

                                  f (kx) = τ (k)f (x),                         (2.7)

for x ∈ X+ , k ∈ K. The space C ∞ (X : τ ) of smooth τ -spherical functions on
X will be identified with the subspace of functions in C ∞ (X+ : τ ) that extend
smoothly to all of X.
    In the following we assume that P ∈ Pσmin is fixed. If w ∈ NK (aq ), then by
  ∞                ∞
CP,w (X+ : τ ) or Cw (X+ : τ ) we denote the space of functions f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ )
with support contained in KA+   q (P )wH. From (2.5) we see that

                       C ∞ (X+ : τ ) = ⊕w∈W Cw
                                             ∞
                                               (X+ : τ ).

Let w ∈ NK (aq ) be fixed for the moment. For f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ) we define the
          ↓                       KM ∩wHw −1
function TP,w f ∈ C ∞ (A+
                        q (P ), Vτ           ) by
                                ↓
                               TP,w f (a) = f (awH).
                                                     ↓       ∞
Since (2.6) is a diffeomorphism, the restriction of TP,w to Cw (X+ : τ ) is an iso-
                                                                                       −1
morphism of complete locally convex spaces onto the space C ∞ (A+
                                                                q (P ), Vτ
                                                                          KM ∩wHw
                                                                                  ).
                                     ↓
Taking the direct sum of the maps TP,w , as w ∈ W, we therefore obtain an iso-
morphism of complete locally convex spaces
        ↓                     ≃                                         −1
       TP,W : C ∞ (X+ : τ ) −→ ⊕w∈W C ∞ (A+
                                          q (P ), Vτ
                                                    KM ∩wHw
                                                            ).                 (2.8)


Definition 2.1 We denote by C ep (X+ : τ ) the space of functions f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ )
                                         ↓                                 KM ∩wHw −1
such that for every w ∈ W the function TP,w  f belongs to C ep (A+
                                                                 q (P ), Vτ           ),
where the latter space is defined as in Definition 1.8, with a, a0 and ∆ replaced
by aq , e and ∆(P ), respectively.

                                          15
   If f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ), we define its asymptotic degree to be the number
                                                  ↓
                            dega (f ): = max deg(TP,w f ).
                                         w∈W

                                                          ↓
It follows from the above definition that restriction of TP,W induces a linear
isomorphism
                                                                     −1
                C ep (X+ : τ ) ≃ ⊕w∈W C ep (A+
                                             q (P ), Vτ
                                                       KM ∩wHw
                                                               ).                   (2.9)
Using conjugations by elements of NK (aq ) it is readily seen that the space
C ep (X+ : τ ) and the map dega : C ep (X+ : τ ) → N are independent of the par-
ticular choices of P and W. In particular, if P ∈ Pσmin and w ∈ NK (aq ), then
  ↓                        KM ∩wHw −1            ↓
TP,w  f ∈ C ep (A+
                 q (P ), Vτ           ) and deg(TP,w f ) ≤ dega (f ). We put
                         ↓                                                     ↓
  Exp(P, w | f ): = Exp(TP,w f ),         and       ExpL (P, w | f ): = ExpL (TP,w f ).
                                                               ↓
Moreover, for all ξ ∈ a∗qC we define q ξ (P, w | f ) = qξ (TP,w   f ). Then, for every
     +
a ∈ Aq (P ),
                                X
                   f (aw) =               aξ q ξ (P, w | f, log a),             (2.10)
                               ξ∈Exp(P,w | f )

where the ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series on the right-hand side neatly
converges on A+
              q (P ).
   For w ∈ NK (aq ), we will use the notation
                              X0,w : = M/M ∩ wHw−1 ;                               (2.11)
moreover, we put τM : = τKM and write C ∞ (X0,w : τM ) for the space of τM -
spherical C ∞ functions from X0,w to Vτ , i.e., the space of functions f ∈ C ∞ (X0,w , Vτ )
satisfying the rule (2.7) for k ∈ KM and x ∈ X0,w . From (2.2) with wHw−1 in
place of H we see that the inclusion KM → M induces a diffemorphism from
KM /KM ∩ wHw−1 onto X0,w . Hence evaluation at the point e(M ∩ wHw−1 )
                                                                         −1
induces a linear isomorphism from C ∞ (X0,w : τM ) onto VτKM ∩wHw . Thus, if
f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ), then for every ξ ∈ aqC there exists a unique C ∞ (X0,w : τM )-
valued polynomial function qξ (P, w | f ) on aq such that
                 qξ (P, w | f, X, e) = q ξ (P, w | f )(X)    (X ∈ aq ).

Using sphericality of the function f we obtain from (2.10) that
                                 X
                 f (maw) =              aξ qξ (P, w | f, log a, m),                (2.12)
                               ξ∈Exp(P,w | f )

for m ∈ M, a ∈ A+ q (P ). The series on the right-hand side is a ∆(P )-exponential
polynomial series in the variable a, with coefficients in C ∞ (X0,w : τM ), relative
to the variable m. As such it converges neatly on A+  q (P ).
    We shall now discuss a lemma whose main purpose is to enable us to reduce
on the set of exponents in certain proofs, in order to simplify the exposition.


                                            16
Lemma 2.2 Let P ∈ Pσmin and let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a complete set of represen-
tatives of W/WK∩H . Assume that f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ).
    There exists a finite set S ⊂ a∗qC of mutually ∆(P )-integrally inequivalent
elements such that Exp(P, v | f ) ⊂ S − N∆(P ) for every v ∈ W.
    If S is a set as above, then there exist unique functions fs ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ),
for s ∈ S, such that                    X
                                   f=      fs ,
                                             s∈S

and such that Exp(P, v | fs ) ⊂ s − N∆(P ), for every v ∈ W.
Proof: There exists a finite set X ⊂ a∗qC such that Exp(P, v | f ) ⊂ X − N∆(P )
for all v ∈ W. Obviously there exists a finite set S as required, such that
X − N∆(P ) ⊂ S − N∆(P ).
    If S is such as mentioned, then for s ∈ S and v ∈ W we define the function
                   KM ∩vHv −1
fs,v : A+
        q (P ) → Vτ           by
                                 X
                  fs,v (a) =              as−ν qs−ν (P, v | f, log a, e);
                               ν∈N∆(P )

here the exponential polynomial series is neatly convergent, hence fs,v belongs
                                KM ∩vHv −1
to the space C ep (A+ q (P ), Vτ           ), for every v ∈ W. By the isomorphism
(2.9) there exists a unique function fs ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) such that fs (av) = fs,v (a)
for v ∈ W, a ∈ A+  q (P ). ByPthe hypothesis on S the sets s − N∆(P ), for s ∈ S,
are disjoint. Hence f = s∈S fs on A+          q (P )v, for every v ∈ W. By (2.5) and
sphericality this equality holds on all of X+ .                                    



3    Asymptotic behavior along walls
In this section we study the asymptotic behavior along walls of functions from
C ep (X+ : τ ); here τ is a smooth representation in a complete locally convex
space Vτ .
    Let P ∈ Pσmin and let Q be a σ-parabolic subgroup with Langlands decom-
position Q = MQ AQ NQ , containing P. In addition to the notation introduced
in the beginning of the previous section, the following notation will also be
convenient.
    We agree to write KQ : = K ∩MQ and HQ : = H ∩MQ . Moreover, WQ denotes
the centralizer of aQq in W. Then WQ ≃ NKQ (aq )/ZKQ (aq ). On the other hand
WQ is also the subgroup of W generated by the reflections in the roots from the
set
                         ∆Q (P ): = {α ∈ ∆(P ) | α|aQq = 0}.
We note that Σ(Q) = Σ(P )\N∆Q (P ). Moreover, let Σr (Q) denote the collection
of aQq -weights in nQ . Then

                          Σr (Q) = {α|aQq | α ∈ Σ(Q)}.


                                             17
Let ∆r (Q) be the collection of weights from the set Σr (Q) that cannot be
written as the sum of two weights from that set; then one readily verifies that
∆r (Q) equals the set of restrictions of elements from ∆(P ) \ ∆Q (P ) to aQq . In
particular, the elements of ∆r (Q) are linearly independent.
    Given a0 ∈ AQq we shall briefly write A+                          +
                                                Qq (a0 ) for the set AQq (∆r (Q), a0 )
defined as in (1.4) with aQq and ∆r (Q) in place of a and ∆, respectively. Simi-
larly, if ρ ∈ ] 0, ∞ [∆r (Q) , we briefly write

       A+          +
        Qq (ρ): = AQq (∆r (Q), ρ) = {a ∈ AQq | a
                                                 −α
                                                    < ρα , ∀α ∈ ∆r (Q)}.

If R > 0, we write A+              +
                      Qq (R) for AQq (ρ), where ρ is defined by ρα = R for every
α ∈ ∆r (Q). Note that A+                                      +           +
                          Qq (1) equals the positive chamber AQq : = exp(aQq ), see
(2.3).
    If v ∈ NK (aq ), we define

                          X1Q,v : = M1Q /M1Q ∩ vHv −1 .                         (3.1)

This is a symmetric space for the involution σ v of M1Q defined by σ v (m) =
vσ(v −1 mv)v −1 . Note that this involution commutes with the Cartan involution
θ|M1Q . Note also that aq is a maximal abelian subspace of Ad(v)(p ∩ q) =
p∩Ad(v)q. Hence it is the analogue of aq for the triple (M1Q , KQ , M1Q ∩vHv −1 ).
The corresponding group Aq may naturally be identified with a subspace of
X1Q,v .
   The image of MQ in X1Q,v may be identified with

                            XQ,v : = MQ /MQ ∩ vHv −1 ,

the symmetric space for the involution σ v |MQ . It follows from the characteriza-
tion of Pσ expressed by (2.4) that

                                     Pσ = Pσ v                                  (3.2)

Hence Q is a σ v -parabolic subgroup as well. Hence aQ ∩ Ad(v)q = aQ ∩ aq =
aQq , and we deduce that the inclusion AQq → AQ induces a diffeomorphism
AQq ≃ AQ /AQ ∩ vHv −1 . From this we conclude that the multiplication map
MQ × AQq → M1Q induces the decomposition

                               X1Q,v ≃ XQ,v × AQq .                             (3.3)


Remark 3.1 In particular, the above definitions cover the two extreme cases
that Q is minimal and that it equals G.
    In the case that Q ∈ Pσmin , we have Q = M ANQ , and XQ,v equals the space
X0,v defined in (2.11). Moreover, X1Q,v ≃ X0,v × Aq .
    In the other extreme case we have X1G,v = G/vHv −1 . This symmetric space
will also be denoted by Xv . Note that right multiplication by v induces an
isomorphism of Xv onto X. Note also that MG equals ◦ G, the intersection of


                                         18
ker χ, as χ ranges over the positive characters of G. Hence XG,v = ◦ G/◦ G ∩
vHv −1 . Finally, Xv ≃ XG,v × AGq , where AGq is the image under exp of the
space aGq , which in turn is the intersection of the root hyperplanes ker α as
α ∈ Σ.
   Let n̄Q : = θnQ be equipped with the restriction of the inner product h · , · i
from g. If Q 6= G we define the function RQ,v : M1Q →]0, ∞[ by

                      RQ,v (m) = kAd(mσ v (m)−1 )|n̄Q k1/2
                                                       op ,

where k · kop denotes the operator norm. We define RG,v to be the constant
function 1.
   The function RQ,v is right M1Q ∩ vHv −1 -invariant. It may therefore also
be viewed as a function on X1Q,v . We shall describe the function RQ,v in more
detail below.
   The orthocomplement of aQq in aq is denoted by ∗ aQq . Note that
                                 ∗
                                     aQq = mQ ∩ aq ;                          (3.4)

hence ∗ aQq is the analogue of aq for the triple (MQ , KQ , HQ ). We recall from the
text following (3.1) that aq is maximal abelian in p∩Ad(v)q hence is the analogue
of aq for the triple (G, K, vHv −1 ). Accordingly, ∗ aQq is also the analogue of aq
for the triple (MQ , KQ , MQ ∩ vHv −1 ).
    In view of (3.2), the group ∗ P = P ∩ MQ is readily seen to be a mini-
mal σ v -parabolic subgroup for MQ ; the associated positive chamber in ∗AQq =
exp(∗ aQq ) is denoted by ∗A+     ∗
                              Qq ( P ).
    Let WQ,v be an analogue for XQ,v of W, that is, WQ,v is a complete set
of representatives in NKQ (aq ) for the quotient WQ /WKQ ∩vHv−1 . Let XQ,v,+ be
the analogue for XQ,v of the open dense subset X+ of X. According to (2.5) this
set may be expressed as the following disjoint union of open subsets of XQ,v
                 [
   XQ,v,+ : =         KQ ∗A+    ∗
                            Qq ( P ) u (MQ ∩ vHv
                                                  −1
                                                     )       (disjoint union).
             u∈WQ,v
                                                                              (3.5)

Let X1Q,v,+ be the analogue of X+ for X1Q,v ; then from (3.3) we see that
X1Q,v,+ ≃ XQ,v,+ × AQq . In terms of this decomposition and (3.5) the function
RQ,v may be expressed as follows.

Lemma 3.2 The function RQ,v : M1Q →]0, ∞[ is continuous, and right M1Q ∩
vHv −1 - and left KQ -invariant. Moreover, if Q 6= G and if a ∈ Aq and u ∈
NKQ (aq ), then

                              RQ,v (au) = max a−α .                           (3.6)
                                            α∈Σ(Q)

Finally, RQ,v ≥ 1 on XQ,v .


                                           19
Proof: Since RG,v is the constant function 1, we may as well assume that
Q 6= G. Continuity of the function RQ,v is obvious from its definition. The
group KQ is σ v invariant and acts unitarily on n̄Q ; hence the left KQ -invariance
is obvious from the definition. If a ∈ Aq , then aσ v (a)−1 = a2 . Hence the
operator norm of Ad(aσ v (a)−1 ) on n̄Q equals the maximal value of a−2α as
α ∈ Σ(Q). This implies (3.6) for u = 1.
    The element u ∈ NKQ (aq ) belongs to MQ , hence Ad(u) normalizes nQ .
Therefore, Ad(u) leaves the collection Σ(Q) of aq -roots in nQ invariant. Put
a′ = u−1 au. Then RQ,v (au) = RQ,v (a′ ) = maxα∈Σ(Q) (a′ )−α . Since Ad(u) leaves
Σ(Q) invariant, (3.6) follows.
    If α ∈ Σ, let hα be the element of aq determined by α(X) = hhα , Xi,
for X ∈ aq . Then the closure of ∗ a+     ∗
                                      Qq ( P ) is contained in the closed convex
cone generated by the elements hβ , for β ∈ ∆Q (P ). If α ∈ ∆(P ) \ ∆Q (P ),
then α(hβ ) = hα , βi ≤ 0, for β ∈ ∆Q (P ); hence α ≤ 0 on ∗ a+           ∗
                                                                      Qq ( P ). But
                                                                +
∆(P ) \ ∆Q (P ) ⊂ Σ(Q), hence it follows that RQ,v ≥ 1 on ∗AQq (∗ P )u, for every
u ∈ WQ,v . The final assertion follows from combining this observation with
(3.5), the left KQ -invariance of RQ,v and density of XQ,v,+ in XQ,v .           

   If 1 ≤ R ≤ ∞ we define

                     XQ,v [R]: = {m ∈ XQ,v | RQ,v (m) < R}.                     (3.7)

Note that XQ,v [1] = ∅ and XQ,v [∞] = XQ,v ; moreover, R1 < R2 ⇒ XQ,v [R1 ] ⊂
XQ,v [R2 ]. Finally, the union of the sets XQ,v [R] as 1 ≤ R < ∞ equals XQ,v .
   In accordance with (3.7) we define XQ,v,+ [R]: = XQ,v,+ ∩ XQ,v [R], for 1 ≤
R ≤ ∞. Moreover, we also put
            ∗ + ∗
             AQq ( P )[R] : =   {a ∈ ∗A+   ∗
                                       Qq ( P ) | a
                                                    −α
                                                       < R, ∀α ∈ Σ(Q)}.

Note that, if α ∈ Σ(P ) \ Σ(Q), then a−α < 1 ≤ R for all a ∈ ∗A+   ∗
                                                               Qq ( P ). Hence

                      ∗ + ∗
                       AQq ( P )[R]   = ∗A+   ∗       +
                                          Qq ( P ) ∩ Aq (P, R).

It follows from (3.5) and Lemma 3.2 that
                  [
   XQ,v,+ [R] =        KQ ∗A+   ∗
                            Qq ( P )[R] u (MQ ∩ vHv
                                                    −1
                                                       )          (disjoint union).
                u∈WQ,v
                                                                                (3.8)

    The function RQ,v plays a role in the description of the asymptotic behavior
of a function f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) along ‘the wall’ A+
                                                   Qq v. This behaviour is described
in terms of an expansion of f (mav) in the variable a ∈ A+     Qq , for m ∈ XQ,v,+ .
Thus, it is of interest to know when mavH belongs to X+ , the domain of f.

Lemma 3.3
 (a) If b ∈ ∗A+   ∗             +
              Qq ( P ) and a ∈ AQq (RQ,v (b)
                                            −1
                                               ) then ba ∈ A+
                                                            q (P ).


                                          20
 (b) Let m ∈ XQ,v,+ . Then mavH ∈ X+ for all a ∈ A+
                                                  Qq (RQ,v (m)
                                                              −1
                                                                 ).
 (c) Let R ≥ 1. Then XQ,v,+ [R]A+
                                Qq (R
                                      −1
                                         )vH ⊂ X+ .

Proof: Let b and a fulfill the hypotheses of (a). If α ∈ ∆Q (P ), then (ba)−α =
b−α < 1. On the other hand we have, for α ∈ ∆(P ) \ ∆Q (P ), that α ∈ Σ(Q),
hence (ba)−α ≤ RQ,v (b)a−α < 1, by Lemma 3.2. Hence ba ∈ A+       q (P ), and (a) is
proved.
    Let m be as in (b), and let a ∈ A+  Qq (RQ,v (m)
                                                    −1
                                                       ). In view of (3.5) we may
                                     ∗ + ∗
write m = kbuh with k ∈ KQ , b ∈ AQq ( P ), u ∈ WQ,v and h ∈ MQ ∩ vHv −1 .
Now mavH = kbuhavH = kbauvH. Thus, it suffices to show that ba ∈ A+          q (P ).
This follows from (a) and the observation that RQ,v (b) = RQ,v (m), by Lemma
3.2.
    Finally, (c) is a straightforward consequence of (b).                         

    If Q ∈ Pσ we put τQ : = τ |KQ . Then, for v ∈ NK (aq ), the space C ep (XQ,v,+ : τQ )
is defined as above (2.9) with XQ,v and τQ in place of X and τ, respectively.

Theorem 3.4 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ). Let Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ).
 (a) There exist a constant k ∈ N, a finite set Y ⊂ a∗QqC , and for each η ∈
     Y − N∆r (Q) a C(XQ,v,+ , Vτ )-valued polynomial function qη = qη (Q, v | f )
     on aQq of degree at most k, such that for every m ∈ XQ,v,+
                    X
      f (mav) =             aη qη (log a, m),   (a ∈ A+Qq (RQ,v (m)
                                                                   −1
                                                                      )), (3.9)
                   η∈Y −N∆r (Q)


     where the ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial series with coefficients in Vτ con-
     verges neatly on the indicated subset of AQq .
 (b) The set Exp(Q, v | f ): = {η ∈ Y − N∆r (Q) | qη 6= 0} is uniquely deter-
     mined. Moreover, the functions qη , where η ∈ Y − N∆r (Q), are unique
     and belong to Pd (aQq ) ⊗ C ep (XQ,v,+ : τQ ), where d: = dega (f ). Finally, if
     R > 1, then the the series on the right-hand side of (3.9) converges neatly
     on A+Qq (R
                −1
                   ) as a ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial series with coefficients
         ∞
     in C (XQ,v,+ [R] : τQ ).

Proof: We will establish existence. Uniqueness then follows from uniqueness
of asymptotics, see Lemma 1.7.
    Fix P ∈ Pσmin with P ⊂ Q. Select a complete set WQ,v ⊂ NKQ (aq ) of
representatives for WQ /WQ ∩ WK∩vHv−1 .
    The set WQ,v v maps injectively into the coset space W/WK∩H . Hence it may
be extended to a complete set W of representatives in NK (aq ) for W/WK∩H . In
view of Lemma 2.2 we may therefore decompose f, if necessary, so that we arrive
in the situation that there exists a s ∈ a∗qC such that Exp(P, uv | f ) ⊂ s−N∆(P ),
for all u ∈ WQ,v . We put sQ = s|aQq .



                                          21
   Let u ∈ WQ,v . Then the function fuv : a 7→ f (auv) has a (unique) ∆(P )-
exponential polynomial expansion on A+
                                     q (P ) of the following type:
                                                    X
                   fuv (a) = f (auv) =                     qu,ξ (log a)aξ .             (3.10)

                                                                              −1   −1
Here qu,ξ ( · ) = qξ (P, uv | f, · , e) belongs to Pd (aq ) ⊗ VτKM ∩uvHv u .
   Let ∂ ∈ S(aq ). Then according to Lemma 1.9, the function ∂fuv is given
on A+q (P ) by a neatly convergent ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series that is
obtained from (3.10) by term by term application of ∂. That is,
                                           X
                          ∂fuv (a) =              q∂,u,ξ (log a)aξ ,         (3.11)

                                      u−1
where q∂,u,ξ is the VτKM ∩uvHv              -valued polynomial function on aq of degree
at most d given by

                q∂,u,ξ (X) = e−ξ(X) ∂[eξ( · ) qu,ξ ](X)           (X ∈ aq ).

Let now R > 1 and let K and K′ be compact subsets of ∗A+                  ∗
                                                                     Qq ( P )[R] and
A+Qq (R
        −1
           ), respectively. Then K′ K is a compact subset of A+   q (P ), by Lemma
3.3 (a). Thus, if a ∈ K′ and b ∈ K, then the series in (3.11) with ba in place of
a converges absolutely, and may be rearranged as follows:
                           X           X
        ∂fuv (ab) =              aη          bξ q∂,u,ξ (log b + log a).        (3.12)

                                         ξ|aQq =η



In view of Lemma 1.5, the convergence is absolutely uniformly for (a, b) ∈ K′ ×K.
    By a similar reasoning it follows from the neat convergence of the series
(3.11) that, for any continuous seminorm σ0 on Pd (aq ) ⊗ Vτ , the series
                        X               X
                                aRe η         bRe ξ σ0 (q∂,u,ξ )           (3.13)

                                              ξ|aQq =η



converges uniformly for a ∈ K′ and b ∈ K.
    Let now η ∈ sQ − N∆r (Q) and let b ∈ ∗A+        ∗               +
                                                Qq ( P ) and a ∈ AQq (RQ,v (b)
                                                                                −1
                                                                                   ).

Then there exists a R > 1 such that b ∈ AQq ( P )[R] and a ∈ AQq (R ). Hence
the series (3.13) converges, and by positivity of all of its terms we infer that the
series

converges for every continuous seminorm σ0 on Pd (aq ) ⊗ Vτ , for every b ∈

    We now specialize to ∂ = 1 and note that q1,u,ξ = qu,ξ . Let X ∈ aQq . We
define the linear endomorphism TX of Pd (aq ) ⊗ Vτ by TX p(H) = p(X + H).
This endomorphism is continuous linear by finite dimensionality. Combining
this with the convergence of (3.14) we infer, for every X ∈ aQq , that

                                                       ). In view of the isomorphism
(2.9) forXQ,v,+ , τQ , WQ,v in place of X+ , τ , W, see also the decomposition (3.5),
there exists a unique polynomial function qη = qη (Q, v | f ) on aQq with values
in C ep (XQ,v,+ : τQ ) such that

    qη (X, bu) = qQ,u,η (X, b),      (X ∈ aQq , u ∈ WQ,v , b ∈ ∗A+   ∗
                                                                 Qq ( P )).           (3.16)

The degree of qη as a polynomial function on aQq is at most d. Combining
this with (3.15) and (3.12) and using that RQ,v (bu) = RQ,v (b), we arrive at
the expansion (3.9) for m = bu and a ∈ A+       Qq (RQ,v (m)
                                                             −1
                                                                ). Using the left KQ -
invariance of RQ,v and the sphericality of f and the functions m 7→ qη (log a, m),
we now obtain (3.9) with absolute convergence; the first two assertions of (b)
follow as well. The assertion of neat convergence in (a) is a consequence of the
final assertion in (b), which we will now proceed to establish.
    Let u ∈ WQ,v and R > 1 be fixed. Then in view of the union (3.8) it
suffices to prove the neat convergence of the series (3.9) as a ∆r (Q)-exponential
polynomial series with coefficients in C ∞ (KQ ∗A+      ∗

subset. Then it suffices to prove that
                            X
                                      aη sup k∂(qQ,u,η (X, · ))k                 (3.17)

                       η∈sQ −N∆r (Q)

converges absolutely.
   From the neat convergence of the series (3.15), for b ∈ ∗AQq (∗ P ), it follows
that term by term differentiation is allowed. Since ∂ ∈ S(∗ aQq ), whereas X ∈

                                            23
aQq , we have
                     b−ξ ∂(bξ TX (qu,ξ )(log b)) = q∂,u,ξ (X + log b).
Hence, for every η ∈ sQ − N∆r (Q),
                                            X
                ∂(qQ,u,η (X, · ))(b) =                bξ q∂,u,ξ (X + log b).   (3.18)
                                         ξ∈s−N∆(P )
                                          ξ|aQq =η



   There exists a continuous seminorm σ2 on Pd (aq ) ⊗ Vτ , such that, for every
b ∈ K and all q ∈ Pd (aq ) ⊗ Vτ ,

                                kq(X + log b)k ≤ σ2 (q).

In particular, this implies that

                           kq∂,u,ξ (X + log b)k ≤ σ2 (q∂,u,ξ ),                (3.19)

for every b ∈ K.
    Combining (3.18) with (3.19) we now obtain
                                            X
            |aη | sup k∂(qQ,u,η )(X, · )k ≤    aRe η bRe ξ σ2 (q∂,u,ξ ).

                                              ξ|aQq =η



Thus, the absolute convergence of (3.17) follows from the uniform convergence
of (3.13), b ∈ K.                                                          

  Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and let Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). Moreover, let the set
Y ⊂ a∗QqC and the polynomials qη = qη (Q, v | f ), for η ∈ Y − N∆r (Q) be as in
Theorem 3.4. As in that theorem, we define

                     Exp(Q, v | f ) = {η ∈ Y − N∆r (Q) | qη 6= 0}

and call the elements of this set the exponents of f along (Q, v). If η ∈ a∗QqC
does not belong to Exp(Q, v | f ), we agree to write qη (Q, v | f ) = 0.
   Let now P ∈ Pσmin be contained in Q and put ∗ P : = P ∩ MQ . Then, for
u ∈ NKQ (aq ), we define

Exp(Q, v | f )P,u = {η ∈ a∗QqC | qη 6= 0    on    aQq ×KQ ∗A+   ∗
                                                            Qq ( P )u(MQ ∩vHv
                                                                              −1
                                                                                 )}.

The elements of this set are called the (Q, v)-exponents of f on ∗A+   ∗
                                                                   Qq ( P )u. Let
WQ,v ⊂ NKQ (aq ) be a complete set of representatives of WQ /WQ ∩ WK∩vHv−1 .
Then it follows from (3.5) that
                                       [
                    Exp(Q, v | f ) =         Exp(Q, v | f )P,u .           (3.20)

We now have the following result.

Theorem 3.5 (Transitivity of asymptotics) Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ). Let P, Q ∈

Moreover, if η ∈ Exp(P, uv | f )|aQq , then for every b ∈ ∗A+      ∗

where the ∆Q (P )-exponential polynomial series (in the variable b) on the right
is neatly convergent on ∗A+   ∗
                          Qq ( P ). Furthermore, the series
                            X
                                          bξ qξ (P, uv | f, X + log b)         (3.23)

converges neatly as a ∆Q (P )-exponential polynomial series in the variable b ∈
∗ + ∗
 AQq ( P ) with coefficients in C ∞ (X0,uv : τM ).
Proof: Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and u ∈ NKQ (aq ) be fixed. Fix a set WQ,v such as in the
beginning of the proof of Theorem 3.4, and such that it contains u. Moreover, we
select a set W of representatives for W/WK∩H in NK (aq ) containing WQ,v v. As
in the proof of the mentioned theorem we may restrict ourselves to the situation
that Exp(P, u′ v | f ) ⊂ s − N∆(P ), for some s ∈ a∗qC and all u′ ∈ WQ,v . In the
following we may now use the notation and results of the proof of Theorem 3.4.
     Let η ∈ sQ − N∆r (Q). Then from (3.16) and (3.15) we infer that, for every
X ∈ aQq ,
                          X
  qη (Q, v | f, X, bu) =        bξ qξ (P, uv | f, X + log b, e), (b ∈ ∗A+   ∗
                                                                        Qq ( P ));
                       ξ∈s−N∆(P )
                        ξ|aQq =η



the series on the left-hand side converges neatly as a ∆Q (P )-exponential polyno-
mial series in the variable b ∈ ∗A+      ∗
                                     Qq ( P ). The function m 7→ qη (Q, v | f, X, mbu)
belongs to C ∞ (X0,uv : τM ), and so does the function m 7→ qξ (P, uv | f, X +
log b, m), for every ξ ∈ s − N∆(P ). Evaluation at e induces a topological linear
                                                −1
isomorphism C ∞ (X0,w : τM ) ≃ VτM∩wHw , for every w ∈ NK (aq ), hence in
particular for w = uv. Thus, it follows from the above that (3.22) holds, with
the asserted convergence. In addition, it follows that the series (3.23) converges
as asserted.
    In the proof of Theorem 3.4 we saw that Exp(Q, v | f ) ⊂ sQ − N∆r (Q).
It follows from the derived expansion (3.22) that (3.21) holds with the inclu-
sion ‘⊂’ in place of the equality sign. For the converse inclusion, let ξ0 ∈
Exp(P, uv | f ) and put η = ξ0 |aQq . We select X ∈ aQq such that the function
b 7→ qξ0 (P, uv | f, X + log b, e) does not vanish identically on ∗AQq . The equality

                                               25
(3.22) holds for all b ∈ ∗A+      ∗
                              Qq ( P ) with a ∆Q (P )-exponential polynomial series
that converges neatly on ∗A+        ∗
                               Qq ( P ). Any exponent ξ of this series coincides with
η = ξ0 |aQq on aQq ; if it also coincides with ξ0 on ∗ aQq , then ξ = ξ0 . Therefore,
the function of b defined by the series on the right-hand side of (3.22) is non-
zero. Hence qη (Q, v | f ) does not vanish identically on aQq × ∗A+     ∗
                                                                    Qq ( P )u and we
conclude that η ∈ Exp(Q, v | f )P,u .                                              

    We proceed by discussing some useful transformation properties for the co-
efficients in the expansion (3.9).
    If u ∈ NK (aq ) it will sometimes be convenient to write uX: = Ad(u)X for
X ∈ aq . Similarly, we will write uξ: = ξ ◦ Ad(u)−1 , for ξ ∈ a∗qC .
    If u, v ∈ NK (aq ) and Q ∈ Pσ , then conjugation by u induces a diffeomor-
phism γu from the space XQ,v onto XuQu−1 ,uv ; we note that γu maps XQ,v,+ onto
XuQu−1 ,uv,+ . It is easily seen that RuQu−1 ,uv (γu (m)) = RQ,v (m), for m ∈ XQ,v .
    For ϕ ∈ C ∞ (XQ,v,+ : τQ ), we define the function ρτ,u ϕ: XuQu−1 ,uv,+ → Vτ
by
                              ρτ,u ϕ(x) = τ (u)ϕ(γu−1 (x)).                     (3.24)
Then ρτ,u is a topological linear isomorphism from the space C ∞ (XQ,v,+ : τQ )
onto the space C ∞ (XuQu−1 ,uv,+ : τuQu−1 ). Likewise, by similar definitions we ob-
tain a topological linear isomorphism from C ∞ (X1Q,v,+ : τQ ) onto C ∞ (X1 uQu−1 ,uv,+ : τuQu−1 ),
also denoted by ρτ,u .

Lemma 3.6 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ), let Q ∈ Pσ and u, v ∈ NK (aq ). Then
                        Exp(uQu−1 , uv | f ) = u Exp(Q, v | f ).
Moreover, for every η ∈ Exp(Q, v | f ),
                 quη (uQu−1 , uv | f ) = [Ad(u−1 )∗ ⊗ ρτ,u ] qη (Q, v | f ).

Proof: Put Q′ = uQu−1 . Let m ∈ XQ′ ,uv,+ . Then, by Theorem 3.4,
                            X
           f (mauv) =               aη qη (Q′ , uv | f )(log a, m),             (3.25)

                               ), where the series on the right-hand side is neatly
convergent. On the other hand, from f (mauv) = τ (u)f (γu−1 (m)u−1 au v) we
see, using Theorem 3.4 again, that
                           X
   f (mauv) = τ (u)                 auζ qζ (Q, v | f )(Ad(u)−1 log a, γu−1 (m)), (3.26)
                      ζ∈Exp(Q,v | f )

     −1
for u au ∈      A+          −1
                 Qq (RQ,v (γu (m))

                                     ).      We now note that the latter condition is
equivalent to
                 a ∈ A+            −1
                      Q′ q (RQ,v (γu (m))
                                         −1
                                            ) = A+
                                                 Q′ q (RQ′ ,uv (m)
                                                                  −1
                                                                     ).
Hence the series (3.25) and (3.26) both converge neatly for a ∈ AQ′ q (RQ′ ,uv (m)−1 ).
All assertions now follow by uniqueness of asymptotics.                           

                                              26
    For later purposes, we also need another type of transformation property.
Recall from Remark 3.1 that for u ∈ NK (aq ) we write Xu = X1G,u = G/uHu−1 ;
let Xu,+ denote the analogue of X+ for this symmetric space. We note that right
multiplication by u induces a diffeomorphism ru from Xu onto X, mapping Xu,+
onto X+ . Hence pull-back by ru the topological linear isomorphism Ru : = ru∗
from C ∞ (X+ : τ ) onto C ∞ (Xu,+ : τ ); it is given by Ru f (x) = f (xu). We note
that the map Ru coincides with the map ρτ,u , introduced in the text above
Lemma 3.6, by sphericality of the functions involved.
    The following result is now an immediate consequence of the definitions.

Lemma 3.7 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and u ∈ NK (aq ). Then Ru f ∈ C ep (Xu,+ : τ ).
Moreover, for each Q ∈ Pσ and every v ∈ NK (aq ), the set Exp(Q, vu | f ) equals
Exp(Q, v | Ru f ). Finally, if ξ ∈ Exp(Q, vu | f ), then

                           qξ (Q, vu | f ) = qξ (Q, v | Ru f ).



4     Behavior of differential operators along walls
We assume that Q ∈ Pσ is fixed. The purpose of this section is to study a
Q-radial decomposition of invariant differential operators on X. This leads to a
series expansion of such operators along (Q, e), with coefficients that turn out
to be globally defined on the group MQσ . This will be of crucial importance for
the applications later on (see Proposition 8.3).
      The involution θσ fixes aq pointwise, hence leaves every root space gα , for α ∈
Σ, invariant. We denote the associated eigenspaces of θσ|gα for the eigenvalues
+1 and −1 by g+            −                                     ±
                   α and gα , respectively. Moreover, we put mα : = dim gα .
                                                                            ±

      We recall that KQ = K ∩ MQ and HQ = H ∩ MQ . Define H1Q : = H ∩ M1Q ;
then H1Q = HQ (AQ ∩ H). Note that KQ = K ∩ M1Q . The group M1Q admits
the Cartan decomposition M1Q = KQ Aq H1Q and normalizes the subalgebra
n̄Q .
      For m ∈ M1Q we define the endomorphism A(m) = AQ (m) ∈ End(n̄Q ) by

                        A(m): = σ ◦ Ad(m−1 ) ◦ θ ◦ Ad(m).                       (4.1)

Moreover, we define the real analytic function δ = δQ : M1Q → R by

                              δ(m) = det(I − A(m)).                             (4.2)

Finally, we define the following subset of M1Q
                                ′
                               M1Q : = M1Q \ δ −1 (0).                          (4.3)


Lemma 4.1
 (a) Let m ∈ M1Q , k ∈ KQ and h ∈ H1Q . Then A(kmh) = Ad(h−1 ) ◦ A(m) ◦ Ad(h).


                                           27
 (b) The endomorphism A(m) ∈ End(n̄Q ) is diagonalizable, for every m ∈
     M1Q . The eigenvalues are given as follows. Let m = kah, with k ∈ KQ ,
     a ∈ Aq and h ∈ H1Q . Then the eigenvalues of A(m) are ±a−2α , α ∈ Σ(Q),
     with multiplicities m±
                          α.
 (c) The operator norm of A(m) is given by kA(m)kop = RQ,1 (m)2 .

Proof: (a) is an immediate consequence of (4.1). Hence, for (b) we may assume
that m = a ∈ Aq . It is easily seen that A(a)|g± = ±a−2α I for α ∈ Σ(Q).

Corollary 4.2 If k ∈ KQ , a ∈ Aq , h ∈ H1Q then

         ′
The set M1Q is left KQ - and right H1Q -invariant, and open dense in M1Q .
Proof: This follows immediately from Lemma 4.1 combined with (4.2) and
(4.3).                                                               

  We define the linear subspace k(Q) of k by k(Q): = k ∩ (nQ + n̄Q ). Then the
map (I + θ): X 7→ X + θX is a linear isomorphism from n̄Q onto k(Q).

Lemma 4.3
 (a) If m ∈ M1Q , then Ad(m−1 )k(Q) + h ⊂ n̄Q + h.
             ′
 (b) If m ∈ M1Q , then Ad(m−1 )k(Q) ⊕ h = n̄Q + h.

Proof: (a) Since k(Q) ⊂ n̄Q + nQ ⊂ n̄Q + h, we have, for all m ∈ M1Q ,

           Ad(m−1 )k(Q) ⊂ Ad(m−1 )(n̄Q + nQ ) = n̄Q + nQ ⊂ n̄Q + h.

(b) The dimension of Ad(m−1 )k(Q) equals that of k(Q), which in turn equals that
                                               ′
of n̄Q . Hence it suffices to prove, for m ∈ M1Q  , that Ad(m−1 )k(Q) ∩ h = 0.
                     −1
    Let X ∈ Ad(m )k(Q) ∩ h. Then θAd(m)X = Ad(m)X and σX = X, and
                                             ′
we see that (I − A(m))X = 0. If m ∈ M1Q          then det(I − Ad(m)) = δ(m) 6= 0
and it follows that X = 0.                                                     

                                            ′
  From Lemma 4.3(b) we see that for m ∈ M1Q     we may define linear maps
Ψ(m) = ΨQ (m) ∈ Hom(n̄Q , k(Q)) and R(m) = RQ (m) ∈ Hom(n̄Q , h) by

                       X = Ad(m−1 )Ψ(m)X + R(m)X.                          (4.4)

Lemma 4.4 Let m ∈ M1Q , k ∈ KQ and h ∈ H1Q . Then
                    Ψ(kmh) =        Ad(k) ◦ Ψ(m) ◦ Ad(h),
                    R(kmh) =        Ad(h−1 ) ◦ R(m) ◦ Ad(h).

Proof: This is an immediate consequence of (4.4) combined with Lemma 4.3(b).

Lemma 4.5 Let m ∈ M1Q . Then
                  Ψ(m) ◦ (I − A(m))     =    (I + θ) ◦ Ad(m),
                  R(m) ◦ (I − A(m))     =    −(I + σ) ◦ A(m).

Proof: From (4.1) it follows that
                  I + σ ◦ A(m) = Ad(m−1 ) ◦ (I + θ) ◦ Ad(m).
This implies in turn that
           I − A(m) = Ad(m−1 ) ◦ (I + θ) ◦ Ad(m) − (I + σ) ◦ A(m).       (4.5)
Since I + θ and I + σ map n̄Q into k(Q) and h, respectively, the lemma follows
from combining (4.5) with (4.4).                                            

Corollary 4.6 The functions Ψ: M1Q    → Hom(n̄Q , k(Q)) and R: M1Q → Hom(n̄Q , h)
are real analytic. Moreover, the functions δ Ψ and δ R extend to real analytic
functions on M1Q .
Proof: From (4.2) and (4.3) we see that I −A(m) is an invertible endomorphism
                  ′
of n̄Q , for m ∈ M1Q . Since Ad(m) and A(m) depend real analytically on m ∈
M1Q , all statements now follow from Lemma 4.5.                             

   If R > 0, then in accordance with (3.7) we define
                    M1Q [R]: = {m ∈ M1Q | RQ,1 (m) < R}.
Moreover, we set MQσ [R]: = MQσ ∩ M1Q [R].

Proof: Let m ∈ M1Q [1]. Then kA(m)kop < 1 by Lemma 4.1(c), and hence
δ(m) 6= 0. This establishes (a).
   Assume that m ∈ MQσ [R1 ] and a ∈ A+   Qq (R2 ). Write m = kbh with k ∈ KQ ,
b ∈ AQq and h ∈ H1Q . Then ma = k(ab)h, hence RQ,1 (ma) = maxα∈Σ(Q) a−α b−α <

that ma ∈ M1Q [1] ⊂ M1Q . Hence Ψ(ma) and R(ma) are defined.
   It follows from Lemma 4.1 that kA(ma)kop < 1. Hence the series

and A(ma)|g−α = a−2α A(m)|g−α . Hence, in view of Lemma 4.5,

                      Q the algebra of functions on M1Q generated by the func-

Let R ≥ 1. Then the series (4.6) converges neatly on AQq (R−1 ), as an exponen-
tial polynomial series with coefficients in C ∞ (MQσ [R]).
    Finally, if ϕ ∈ R+
                     Q , then (4.6) holds with ϕ0 = 0.

Proof: Uniqueness of the functions ϕξ is obvious. Therefore it suffices to
prove existence and the remaining assertions. One readily checks that it suffices
to prove the assertions for a collection of generators of the algebra R+  Q . Such
a collection of generators is formed by the functions of the form ϕ = ξ ◦ Ψ,
with ξ ∈ Hom(n̄Q , k(Q))∗ , and by the functions of the form ϕ = η ◦ RQ , where
η ∈ Hom(n̄Q , h)∗ . For both types of generators all assertions follow immediately
from Proposition 4.8.                                                           

    As is the previous section we assume that τ is a smooth representation of K
in a locally convex space Vτ . The space of continuous linear endomorphisms of
Vτ is denoted by End(Vτ ).
    If an element u of the space

                        D1Q : = RQ ⊗ End(Vτ ) ⊗ U (m1Q )                       (4.7)

is of the form ϕ ⊗ L ⊗ v, with ϕ ∈ RQ , L ∈ End(Vτ ), and v ∈ U (m1Q ), then
we define the differential operator u∗ on C ∞ (M1Q  ′
                                                       , Vτ ) by u∗ f = ϕL ◦ [Rv f ];
here R denotes the right regular representation. The map u 7→ u∗ extends
to an injective linear map from D1Q to the space of smooth End(Vτ )-valued
differential operators of C ∞ (M1Q

                                   , Vτ ). We also define the subspace

                        D1Q : = R+
                                 Q ⊗ End(Vτ ) ⊗ U (m1Q ).

Via the map u 7→ 1 ⊗ I ⊗ u we identify U (m1Q ) with a subspace of D1Q . Then
u∗ = Ru for u ∈ U (m1Q ).
    Let M1Q,+ be the preimage in M1Q of the set X1Q,1,+ (see below (3.5)). The
set

                          M1Q,+  : = M1Q,+ ∩ M1Q
is an open dense subset of M1Q that is left KQ - and right H1Q -invariant.
    In view of the decomposition g = n̄Q ⊕ (m1Q + h), there exists, for every
D ∈ U (g), an element D0 ∈ U (m1Q ) with deg(D0 ) ≤ deg(D), such that

                           D − D0 ∈ n̄Q U (g) + U (g)h.                        (4.8)

The element D0 is uniquely determined modulo U (m1Q )h1Q . We recall from
[5], Sect. 2, see also [7], p. 548-549, that the assignment D 7→ D0 induces an
algebra homomorphism µ′Q = 8 µQ̄ : D(X) → D(M1Q /H1Q ), and that the homo-
morphism µQ : D(X) → D(M1Q /H1Q ), defined by µQ (D) = dQ ◦ µ′Q (D) ◦ d−1   Q
with dQ (m): = | det(Ad(m)|nQ )|1/2 for m ∈ M1Q , only depends on Q through
the Levi component M1Q .

Proposition 4.10 Let D ∈ D(X). There exists a u+ ∈ D1Q of degree deg(u+ ) <
                                 ∞
deg(D) such that, for every f ∈ C (X+ : τ ),

                     Df |M1Q,+
                          ′    = [µ′Q (D) + u+∗ ](f |M1Q,+
                                                      ′    ).

Proof: By induction on the degree we will first establish the following assertion
for an element D of U (g). Let D0 ∈ U (m1Q ) satisfy (4.8). Then there exist
finitely many ϕi ∈ R+  Q , ui ∈ U (k), and vi ∈ U (m1Q ), for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, such that
deg(ui ) + deg(vi ) < deg(D), and such that
                       n
                       X
            D − D0 ≡         ϕi (m) [Ad(m)−1 ui ] vi       mod     U (g)h,         (4.9)
                       i=1

                  ′
for every m ∈ M1Q   .
    The assertion is trivially true for D constant. Thus, assume that D is not
constant and that the assertion has been established for D of strictly smaller
degree. Let D0 ∈ U (m1Q ) be as above. Then, modulo U (g)h, D − D0 equals a
finite sum of terms of the form XD1 , with X ∈ n̄Q and D1 ∈ U (n̄Q ⊕ m1Q ) such
that deg D1 < deg D.
                ′
    For m ∈ M1Q,+     we have X = Ad(m)−1 Ψ(m)X + RQ (m)X; hence

       XD1 ≡ (Ad(m)−1 Ψ(m)X)D1 + [RQ (m)X, D1 ]                  mod     U (g)h.

Now Ad(m)−1 Ψ(m)X is a finite sum of terms of the form ϕ(m)[Ad(m)−1 u]
with u ∈ k(Q) and ϕ ∈ R+   Q . Applying the induction hypothesis to D1 we see
that [Ad(m)−1 Ψ(m)X]D1 may be expressed as a sum similar to the one on the
right-hand side of (4.9).
    On the other hand, [RQ (m)X, D1 ] is a finite sum of elements of the form
ψ(m)D2 , with ψ ∈ R+  Q and D2 ∈ U (g), deg D2 < deg D. Applying the induction
hypothesis to D2 , we see that [RQ (m)X, D1 ] may also be expressed as a sum of
the form (4.9). This establishes the assertion involving (4.9) of the beginning
of the proof.
    Let now D ∈ D(X). By abuse of notation we use the same symbol D for a
representative of D in U (g)H , and let D0 be as above. Then µ′Q (D) equals the
canonical image of D0 in U (m1Q )H1Q . Let ϕi , ui , vi be as above and such that
(4.9) holds. Then for every f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ) and all m ∈ M1Q,+′
                                                                   we have
                                              n
                                              X
      Df (m)    = µ′Q (D)(f |M1Q,+
                              ′    )(m) +           ϕi (m)RAd(m)−1 ui Rvi f (m)
                                              i=1
                                              Xn
                = µ′Q (D)(f |M1Q,+
                              ′    )(m) +           ϕi (m)τ (ǔi )Rvi f (m)
                                              i=1


                                                   i Rvi f (m) = τ (ui )Rvi f (m).
where we have used that RAd(m)−1 ui Rvi f (m) = LǔP
Thus, we obtain the desired expression with u+ = ni=1 ϕi ⊗ τ (ui ) ⊗ vi .       

    Let U ⊂ MQσ be an open subset. It will be convenient to be able to re-
fer to a ‘formal application’ of elements of the space D1Q , defined in (4.7),
to F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )), the space of (formal) ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial
series with coefficients in C ∞ (U, Vτ ), see the definition preceding Lemma 1.9.
There is a natural way to define a formal application that is compatible with
the expansions of Corollary 4.9 and with the map u 7→ u∗ , defined in the text
following (4.7). The motivation for the following somewhat tedious chain of
definitions will become clear in Lemma 4.11.
    The product decomposition M1Q ≃ MQσ × AQq induces a natural isomor-
phism from U (m1Q ) onto U (mQσ ) ⊗ U (aQq ), by which we shall identify. Accord-
ingly we have a natural isomorphism

                               D1Q ≃ ◦ D1Q ⊗ U (aQq ),                            (4.10)

where ◦ D1Q : = RQ ⊗ End(Vτ ) ⊗ U (mQσ ). To each element ϕ ∈ RQ we may
associate its ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial series of the form (4.6); this induces
a linear embedding RQ → F ep (AQq , C ∞ (MQσ )) which by identity on the other
tensor components may be extended to a linear embedding
                              ◦
                                  D1Q → F ep (AQq , DQσ ),

where DQσ : = C ∞ (MQσ ) ⊗ End(Vτ ) ⊗ U (mQσ ). By identity on the second tensor
component in (4.10) this embedding extends to a linear embedding

                      ep: D1Q → F ep (AQq , DQσ ) ⊗ U (aQq ).                     (4.11)

The image ep(u) of an element u ∈ D1Q under this embedding will be called the
∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion of u. Via the right regular action of
U (mQσ ) we may naturally identify DQσ with the space of C ∞ -differential opera-
tors acting on C ∞ (MQσ , Vτ ). Accordingly, we have a continuous bilinear pairing
DQσ × C ∞ (U, Vτ ) → C ∞ (U, Vτ ). This induces a formal application map from
F ep (AQq , DQσ ) ⊗ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )) to F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )) in the fashion
described above Lemma 1.10. The image of an element of the form u ⊗ f under
this map will be denoted by uf.
    On the other hand, in Lemma 1.9 we described the formal application map
U (aQq ) ⊗ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )) → F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )). The image of an ele-
ment of the form v ⊗ f under this map is denoted by vf. Combination of the
above formal application maps leads to the formal application map

 [F ep (AQq , DQσ ) ⊗ U (aQq )] ⊗ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )) → F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )),

given by (u ⊗ v) ⊗ f 7→ (u ⊗ v)f : = u(vf ), for u ∈ F ep (AQq , DQσ ), v ∈ U (aQq )
and f ∈ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )). Composing with the embedding (4.11) we finally
obtain the linear map

              D1Q ⊗ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )) → F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ ))

given by u ⊗ f 7→ uf : = ep(u)f, for u ∈ D1Q and f ∈ F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )). We
shall call this map the formal application of D1Q to F ep (AQq , C ∞ (U, Vτ )).

                                            33
   Let now R ≥ 1 and let U ⊂ MQσ [R] be an open subset. We use the obvious
natural isomorphism to identify the space C ep (A+   Qq (R
                                                           −1
                                                              ), C ∞ (U, Vτ )) with a
subspace of C ∞ (U A+
                    Qq (R
                          −1
                             ), Vτ ). If u ∈ D1Q , then the associated differential
operator u∗ induces a map from the first space into the latter.

Lemma 4.11 Let u ∈ D1Q , let R ≥ 1 and let U ⊂ MQσ [R] be an open subset.
Then u∗ maps the space C ep (A+  Qq (R
                                       −1
                                          ), C ∞ (U, Vτ )) into itself. Moreover, if
f belongs to that space, then the ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion of
u∗ f is obtained from the formal application of u to the exponential polynomial
expansion of f.
Proof: This follows from retracing the definitions of u∗ and of the formal
application of u given above and applying Corollary 4.9 and Lemmas 1.9 and
1.10.                                                                    

  Given v ∈ NK (aq ) we define µQ,v : D(X) → D(X1Q,v ) = D(M1Q /M1Q ∩
vHv −1 ) by
                        µQ,v = Ad(v) ◦ µv−1 Qv ,
where Ad(v): D(X1v−1 Qv,e ) → D(X1Q,v ) is induced by the restriction to U (m1v−1 Qv )
of Ad(v) on U (g). Then µQ,v depends on Q only through M1Q . It is easily seen
that

                                µQ,v = µvQ ◦ Ad(v)                            (4.12)

where µvQ : D(Xv ) = D(G/vHv −1 ) → D(X1Q,v ) = D(M1Q /M1Q ∩ vHv −1 ) is de-
fined similarly as µQ , but with H replaced by vHv −1 , and where Ad(v): D(X) →
D(Xv ) is induced by Ad(v) on U (g).
    Let MQσ,+ = MQσ ∩ M1Q,+ and, for R ≥ 1, MQσ,+ [R] = MQσ [R] ∩ M1Q,+ .

Lemma 4.12 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and let D ∈ D(X). Then Df ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ).
   Let Q ∈ Pσ and let u+ ∈ R+  Q ⊗ End(Vτ ) ⊗ U (m1Q ) be associated with D as
in Proposition 4.10. Then the following holds.
 (a) The ∆r (Q)-exponential expansion of Df along (Q, e) is obtained by the
     formal application of µ′Q (D) + u+ to the ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial
     expansion of f along (Q, e).
 (b) Let v ∈ NK (aq ), then Exp(Q, v | Df ) ⊂ Exp(Q, v | f ) − N∆r (Q).
 (c) If ξ is a leading exponent of f along (Q, v), then

      aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, v | Df, log a, m) = [µQ,v (D)ϕ](ma),      (m ∈ MQσ,+ , a ∈ AQq ),
                                                                            (4.13)

      where the function ϕ: M1Q,+ → Vτ is defined by ϕ(ma) = aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, v | f, log a, m),
      for m ∈ MQσ,+ and a ∈ AQq .




                                         34
Proof: Let R ≥ 1 and let f be the function A+           Qq (R
                                                              −1
                                                                 ) → C ∞ (MQσ,+ [R], Vτ )
defined by f (a, m) = f (ma). It follows from the hypothesis on f and Theo-
rem 3.4 that f (a, m) belongs to C ep (A+   Qq (R
                                                  −1
                                                     ), C ∞ (MQσ,+ [R], Vτ )). Moreover,
its ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion coincides with the expansion of f
along (Q, e). Put u = µ′Q (D)+u+ . Then it follows from the previous lemma that
u∗ f belongs to C ep (A+  Qq (R
                                −1
                                   ), C ∞ (MQσ,+ [R], Vτ )); its expansion is obtained
from the formal application of u to the (Q, e)-expansion of f. It follows from
Theorem 3.4 that the expansion is independent of R and that its coefficients
are functions in C ∞ (MQσ,+ , Vτ ). On the other hand, it follows from Proposition
4.10 that u∗ f (a, m) = Df (ma). This implies that Df has a ∆r (Q)-exponential
polynomial expansion along (Q, e) with coefficients in C ∞ (MQσ,+ , Vτ ). Since Df
is right H-invariant, the coefficients are actually functions in C ∞ (XQ,e,+ , Vτ ).
Moreover, the expansion is independent of R and converges neatly on A+          Qq (R
                                                                                      −1
                                                                                         )
                                           ∞
as an expansion with coefficients in C (XQ,e,+ [R], Vτ ). In particular this holds
for every minimal parabolic subgroup Q; hence Df ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ).
     In the above we have established assertion (a). It follows from this assertion
that (b) holds with v = 1 for every Q ∈ Pσ . By Lemma 3.6 it also holds for
arbitrary Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ).
     It remains to establish (c). Assume first that v = e. Fix ξ ∈ ExpL (Q, e | f ).
Then by (a), aξ qξ (Q, e | Df, log a, m) is the term with exponent ξ in the series
that arises from the formal application of µ′Q (D) + u+ to the (Q, e)-expansion of
f. The exponents of the expansion ep(u+ ) of u+ all belong to −[N∆r (Q)] \ {0}.
The application of u+ therefore gives rise to an expansion with exponents in
Exp(Q, e | f )−[N∆r (Q)]\{0}. The latter set does not contain ξ, since ξ is leading.
Hence aξ qξ (Q, e | Df, log a, m) is the term with exponent ξ in the expansion that
arises from the formal application of µ′Q (D) to the (Q, e)-expansion of f. Now
µ′Q (D) ∈ U (m1Q ) ≃ U (mQσ ) ⊗ U (aQq ) and we see that the formal application of
µ′Q (D) to the (Q, e) expansion of f is induced by term by term differentiation
in the AQq and the MQσ variables. This implies that aξ qξ (Q, e | Df, log a, m) =
[µ′Q (D)ϕ′ ](ma), where ϕ′ (ma) = aξ qξ (Q, e | f, log a, m). This implies (4.13) for
v = e.
     Let now v ∈ NK (aq ) be arbitrary, and put f v = Rv f . We shall apply the
version of (4.13) just established to the expansion along (Q, e) of the function
f v on Xv . Let ξ be a leading exponent of f along (Q, v), then it follows from
Lemma 3.7 that ξ is also a leading exponent of f v along (Q, e). Moreover, let
D ∈ D(X), then (Df )v = Dv f v where Dv : = Ad(v)D ∈ D(Xv ). Hence

                aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, e | (Df )v , log a, m) = [µvQ (Dv )ϕ](ma),            (4.14)

for m ∈ MQσ,+ , a ∈ AQq , where ϕ(ma) = aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, e | f v , log a, m). It follows
from Lemma 3.7 that ϕ(ma) = aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, v | f, log a, m), and qξ (Q, e | (Df )v ) =
qξ (Q, v | Df ). Now (4.13) follows from (4.14) and (4.12).                        


Lemma 4.13 Let P ∈ Pσmin and assume that f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ). Let S ⊂ a∗qC be
a finite set as in Lemma 2.2, and let D ∈ D(X). Then Exp(P, v | Df ) ⊂ S − N∆

                                           35
for every v ∈ NK (aq ) and, with notation as in Lemma 2.2,

                                 (Df )s = D(fs ).                            (4.15)

Proof: It follows immediately from Lemma 4.12(b) that Exp(P, v | Df ) ⊂ S −
N∆ and that Exp(P, v | D(fs )) ⊂ s − N∆ for s ∈ S. Now (4.15) follows from
Lemma 2.2.                                                                



5    Spherical eigenfunctions
In this section we assume that (τ, Vτ ) is a finite dimensional continuous represen-
tation of K. Let I be a cofinite ideal of the algebra D(X). Then by C ∞ (X+ : τ : I)
we denote the space of f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ) satisfying the system of differential equa-
tions
                               Df = 0,         (D ∈ I).


Remark 5.1 Many results of [3] that are formulated for D(X)-finite τ -spherical
functions on X are actually valid for the bigger class of D(X)-finite functions
in C ∞ (X+ : τ ) as well, since their proofs only involve behavior of functions and
operators on X+ . If such extended results are used in the text, we may give a
reference to the present remark.


Remark 5.2 Let v ∈ NK (aq ). We recall from the text preceding Lemma 3.7
that right translation by v induces a topological linear isomorphism Rv from
C ∞ (X+ : τ ) onto the space C ∞ (Xv,+ : τ ). It maps the subspace of D(X)-finite
functions onto the subspace of D(Xv )-finite functions. Thus, if f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ )
is a D(X)-finite function, then the theory of [3] may be applied to the D(Xv )-
finite function Rv f ; the results are then easily reformulated in terms of the
function f.


Lemma 5.3 Let I ⊂ D(X) be a cofinite ideal. Then C ∞ (X+ : τ : I) ⊂ C ep (X+ : τ ).
In particular, the elements of C ∞ (X+ : τ : I) are real analytic functions on X+ .
Moreover, there exists a finite set XI ⊂ a∗qC such that ExpL (P, v | f ) ⊂ XI , for
all f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : I), P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ NK (aq ).
Proof: Let Q ∈ Pσmin. Applying Theorem 2.5 of [3], see Remark 5.1, we obtain
that f |A+ q (Q) is given by a neatly converging ∆(Q)-exponential polynomial
expansion for each f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : I). Moreover, by Theorem 2.4 of [3], there
exists a finite set XI,Q,e ⊂ a∗qC , such that ExpL (f |A+
                                                        q (Q)) ⊂ XI,Q,e . Let w ∈ W.
Applying the above argument to Rw f, cf. Remark 5.2, we see, more generally,
        ↓
that TQ,w   f is given by the same type of expansion with leading exponents in
a finite set XI,Q,w ⊂ a∗qC independent of f . This implies that f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ),


                                        36
with ExpL (P, v | f ) ⊂ XI : = ∪Q,w XI,Q,w , for all P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ W. Finally,
if v ∈ NK (aq ) is arbitrary, there exists w ∈ W, m ∈ KM and h ∈ NK∩H (aq )
such that v = mwh, and then ExpL (P, v | f ) = ExpL (P, w | f ) ⊂ XI .          


Corollary 5.4 Let P ∈ Pσmin and let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a complete set of
representatives of W/WK∩H . Let I be a cofinite ideal in D(X). Then there
exists a finite set S = SI satisfying the properties of Lemma 2.2 for every
f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : I). Moreover, if SI is any such set, then fs ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : I)
for every f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : I) and all s ∈ SI .
Proof: This is an immediate consequence of Lemmas 5.3 and 4.13.                 

    The set XI in Lemma 5.3 can be described more explicitly if the ideal I
has codimension 1. Let b be a maximal abelian subspace of q containing aq , let
Σ(b) be the restricted root system of b in gC , and let W (b) be the associated
reflection group.
    Let γ be the Harish-Chandra isomorphism from D(X) onto the algebra I(b)
of W (b)-invariants in S(b), see [5], Sect. 2. To an element ν ∈ b∗C we associate
the character D 7→ γ(D : ν) of D(X) and denote its kernel by Iν . Then Iν is an
ideal of codimension one in D(X); in fact, any codimension one ideal is of this
form.
    Let W0 (b) be the normalizer of aq in W (b). Then restriction to aq induces
an epimorphism from W0 (b) onto W, cf. [5], Lemma 4.6. We put bk : = b ∩ k.
Then b = bk ⊕ aq . Moreover, this decomposition is invariant under W0 (b).

Lemma 5.5 There exists a finite subset L = Lτ of b∗kC with the following
property. Let ν ∈ b∗C and f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ : Iν ). Let P ∈ Pσmin , v ∈ NK (aq ) and
assume that ξ ∈ ExpL (P, v | f ). Then

                             ν ∈ W (b)(L + ξ + ρP ).

   The proof is based on the following result, which will be proved first.

Lemma 5.6 There exists a finite subset L = Lτ of b∗kC with the following
property. Let ν ∈ b∗C and ϕ ∈ C ∞ (M1 /HM1 : τ ), and assume that

                              µP (D)ϕ = γ(D : ν)ϕ

for all D ∈ D(X), where µP : D(X) → D(M1 /HM1 ) is as defined above Propo-
sition 4.10, with P ∈ Pσmin. Then ϕ|Aq is a linear combination of exponential
polynomials of the form a 7→ p(log a)awν , where p ∈ P (aq ) and where w ∈ W (b)
satisfies wν|bk ∈ L.
Proof: The algebra D(M/HM ) acts semisimply on C ∞ (M/HM : τ ), see [5],
Lemma 4.8; let L be the (finite) set of Λ ∈ b∗kC such that the associated char-
acter of D(M/HM ) occurs. We may assume that ϕ is a joint eigenfunction for

                                       37
D(M/HM ), with eigenvalue character given by Λ ∈ L. It follows that

                         (Dϕ)|Aq = γM1 (D : Λ + · )(ϕ|Aq )

for D ∈ D(M1 /HM1 ) ≃ D(M/HM ) ⊗ S(aq ). Here γM1 denotes the Harish-
Chandra isomorphism from D(M1 /HM1 ) into S(b), defined as in [9], above
eq. (2.11), and γM1 (D : Λ + · ) ∈ S(aq ) is considered as a differential opera-
tor on Aq . Combining this identity with the assumption on ϕ, the identity
γM1 ◦ µP = γ, and the surjectivity of γ: D(X) → S(b)W (b) , it follows that

                            u(Λ + · )(ϕ|Aq ) = u(ν)ϕ|Aq

for all u ∈ S(b)W (b) . Let ϕ̃ ∈ C ∞ (b) be defined by ϕ̃(X+Y ) = eΛ(X) ϕ(exp Y ) for
X ∈ bk , Y ∈ aq , then uϕ̃ = u(ν)ϕ̃. This implies that ϕ̃ is a linear combination
of exponential polynomials of the form p ewν , where p ∈ P (b) and w ∈ W (b),
see [27], Thm. III.3.13. However, from the definition of ϕ̃ it is readily seen that
w only contributes if wν|bk = Λ.                                                   

  Proof of Lemma 5.5: We define the τM -spherical function ϕ: M1 /M1 ∩
vHv −1 ≃ M/M ∩ vHv −1 × Aq → Vτ by

                       ϕ(ma) = aρP +ξ qξ (P, v | f )(log a, m).

Then it follows from the equation Df = γ(D : ν)f and Lemma 4.12 (c) applied
to D − γ(D : ν) in place of D, that

                              µP,v (D)ϕ = γ(D : ν)ϕ.

Since ϕ is τ -spherical and non-zero, its restriction to Aq does not vanish.
     Let first v = e, and let L be as in Lemma 5.6. It then follows immediately
from that lemma that there exists w ∈ W (b) such that wν|bk ∈ L and wν|aq =
ξ + ρP .
     For general v ∈ NK (aq ) we also obtain the result from Lemma 5.6, by
applying it to the function ϕv : = ρτ,v−1 ϕ. Indeed, it follows from the definition of
µP,v that ϕv satisfies the assumption of the lemma. Hence there exists w ∈ W (b)
such that wν|bk ∈ L and wν|aq = v −1 (ξ + ρP ). Let v ′ ∈ W0 (b) be such that
v ′ Y = vY for all Y ∈ aq , then ν ∈ (v ′ w)−1 (v ′ L + ξ + ρP ).                   

   We will also need a result on leading coefficients along non-minimal parabolic
subgroups.

Lemma 5.7 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) be a D(X)-finite function. Let Q ∈ Pσ , v ∈
NK (aq ) and assume that ξ ∈ ExpL (Q, v | f ). Then the function ϕ: X1Q,v,+ → Vτ
defined by

        ϕ(ma) = aξ+ρQ qξ (Q, v | f, log a, m)      (m ∈ XQ,v,+ , a ∈ AQq ),

is D(X1Q,v )-finite.

                                         38
Proof: Let I be the annihilator of f in the algebra D(X). Then it follows from
Lemma 4.12 (c) that µQ,v (D)ϕ = 0 for all D ∈ I. The algebra D(X1Q,v ) is a
finite module over the image of the homorphism µQ,v ; see [5], p. 342, and apply
conjugation by v. Hence µQ,v (I) generates a cofinite ideal in D(X1Q,v ). This
establishes the result.                                                       

    We end this section with a result that limits the asymptotic exponents oc-
curring in discrete series representations to a countable set. Later we will apply
this result to exclude the possibility of a ‘continuum of discrete series’ (see the
proof of Lemma 9.13).
    To formulate the result we need to define asymptotic exponents for a K-
finite rather than a τ -spherical function. We denote by K       b the collection of
equivalence classes of irreducible continuous representations of K. If ϑ ⊂ K         b
                                ∞
is a finite subset, then by C (X+ )ϑ we denote the space of smooth K-finite
functions in C ∞ (X+ ) all of whose K-types belong to ϑ. By Vϑ : = C(K)ϑ we
denote the space of left K-finite continuous functions on K all of whose left K-
types belong to ϑ. Moreover, by τϑ we denote the restriction of the right regular
representation to Vϑ . If f ∈ C ∞ (X+ )ϑ , then the function ςϑ (f ): X → Vϑ , defined
by ςϑ (f )(x)(k) = f (kx) for x ∈ X+ , k ∈ K belongs to C ∞ (X+ : τϑ ). The map
ς: = ςϑ is a topological linear isomorphism from C ∞ (X+ )ϑ onto C ∞ (X+ : τϑ ),
intertwining the D(X)-actions on these spaces. Moreover, ς maps the closed
subspace C ∞ (X)ϑ of globally defined smooth functions onto the similar subspace
C ∞ (X : τϑ ). We denote by C ep (X+ )ϑ the preimage of C ep (X+ : τϑ ) under ς.
It follows from Lemma 5.3 that D(X)-finite funcitons in C ∞ (X+ )ϑ belong to
C ep (X+ )ϑ . Let f ∈ C ep (X+ )ϑ ; then for P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ) we define the
set of exponents of f along (P, v) by

                          Exp(P, v | f ): = Exp(P, v | ς(f )).

Note that this collection is the union for k ∈ K and m ∈ XP,v,+ of the collections
of exponents occurring in the ∆(P )-exponential polynomial expansions of a 7→
f (kamv).
    Let C(X) denote the space of Schwartz functions on X, see [9], Section 6, and
let A2 (X)K denote the space of K-finite and D(X)-finite functions f ∈ C(X).
These functions are real analytic and belong to L2 (X), cf. [3], Thm. 7.3.

Lemma 5.8 Assume that the center of G is compact. Then

            {ξ ∈ Exp(P, v | f ) | P ∈ Pσmin, v ∈ NK (aq ), f ∈ A2 (X)K }

is a countable subset of a∗qC .

Proof: Let X  b d denote the set of equivalence classes of discrete series representa-
tions of the symmetric space X. This set is countable, since L2 (X) is a separable
Hilbert space. Given ω ∈ X   b d we denote by L2 (X)ω the collection of functions
f ∈ L (X) whose closed G-span in L2 (X) is equivalent to a finite direct sum of
      2

copies of ω. Let K b denote the countable set of equivalence classes of irreducible


                                          39
representations of K. Given ω ∈ X    b d and δ ∈ K,
                                                  b we denote by L2 (X)ω,δ the
                                                2
collection of K-finite elements of type δ in L (X)ω . It follows from [3], Thm.
7.3, that L2 (X)ω,δ is a subspace of A2 (X)K , and from [2], Lemma 3.9, that this
subspace is finite dimensional. On the other hand, let f ∈ A2 (X)K , and let
V ⊂ L2 (X) denote the closed G-span of f . It follows from [2], Lemma 3.9, that
V is admissible. Since V is finitely generated, it must then be a finite direct
sum of irreducible representations. This implies that f belongs to a finite direct
sum of spaces L2 (X)ω,δ . From the above we conclude that A2 (X)K equals the
following countable algebraic direct sum:
                                               2
                       A2 (X)K = ⊕ω∈X       b L (X)ω,δ .
                                    b d , δ∈K                                (5.1)

Let ω ∈ Xb d and δ ∈ K.
                      b Then it follows from Lemma 5.3 and the finite di-
mensionality of L (X)ω,δ that there exists a countable subset Eω,δ ⊂ a∗qC such
                 2

that
                             Exp(P, v | f ) ⊂ Eω,δ
for all f ∈ L2 (X)ω,δ , P ∈ Pσmin , v ∈ NK (aq ). Combining this observation with
(5.1), we obtain the desired result.                                           



6    Separation of exponents
Let Q ∈ Pσ . In the next section we shall consider functions fλ ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ),
with parameter λ ∈ a∗QqC , whose exponents along P ∈ Pσmin lie in sets of the
form W λ + S − N∆(P ), where S ⊂ a∗qC is a finite set. In general, given ξ ∈
W λ + S − N∆(P ), the elements s ∈ W/WQ and η ∈ S − N∆(P ), such that
ξ = sλ + η, are not unique. In the present section we define a condition on λ
that allows this unique determination for all ξ. In particular, the condition is
valid for generic λ ∈ a∗QqC . We consider also the case where P is non-minimal.
    Let P, Q ∈ Pσ . We define the equivalence relation ∼P |Q on W by

                 s ∼P |Q t   ⇐⇒     ∀λ ∈ a∗Qq : sλ|aP q = tλ|aP q .          (6.1)

The associated quotient is denoted by W/ ∼P |Q . We note that the classes in
W/ ∼P |Q are left WP - and right WQ -invariant. Thus, W/ ∼P |Q may also be
viewed as a quotient of WP \W/WQ .
    If s, t ∈ W then one readily sees that s ∼P |Q t ⇐⇒ s−1 ∼Q|P t−1 . Hence
the anti-automorphism s 7→ s−1 of W factors to a bijection from W/ ∼P |Q onto
W/ ∼Q|P , which we denote by σ 7→ σ −1 .
    If s ∈ W and λ ∈ a∗QqC , then the restriction sλ|aP q depends on s through its
class [s] in W/ ∼P |Q . We therefore agree to write

                               [s]λ|aP q : = sλ|aP q .




                                         40
Definition 6.1 For S ⊂ a∗qC a finite subset, we define a∗◦    QqC (P, S) to be the
subset of a∗QqC consisting of elements λ such that, for all s1 , s2 ∈ W,

        (s1 λ − s2 λ)|aP q ∈ [S + (−S)]|aP q + Z∆r (P )   ⇒   s1 ∼P |Q s2 .



Lemma 6.2 Let S ⊂ a∗qC be finite. Then, for λ ∈ a∗QqC ,
                                   [                                   
   W λ|aP q + (S − N∆(P ))|aP q =           σλ|aP q + (S − N∆(P ))|aP q .
                                     σ∈W/∼P |Q

Moreover, the union is disjoint if and only if λ ∈ a∗◦
                                                    QqC (P, S).

Proof: Straightforward.                                                           


Lemma 6.3 Let Q, P ∈ Pσ , and let S be a finite subset of a∗qC . Then a∗◦
                                                                        QqC (P, S)
equals the complement of the union of a locally finite collection of proper affine
subspaces in a∗QqC .
Proof: Let p: a∗qC → a∗P qC denote the map induced by restriction to aP q . Let
Π be the complement of the diagonal in the set W/ ∼P |Q ×W/ ∼P |Q . Then
for every σ = (σ1 , σ2 ) ∈ Π and every η ∈ a∗P qC we write Aσ,η = {λ ∈ a∗QqC |
p(σ1 λ−σ2 λ) = η}. Note that Aσ,0 is a proper affine subspace of a∗QqC . If λ ∈ Aσ,η
then Aσ,η equals λ + Aσ,0 ; hence the set Aσ,η is either empty or a proper affine
subspace.
    Let A be the collection of subsets of the form Aσ,ξ , for σ ∈ Π and ξ ∈
p(S + (−S)) + Z∆r (P ). Then a∗◦                                                ∗
                                  QqC (P, S) equals the complement of ∪A in aQqC .
Thus, it remains to show that the collection A is locally finite.
    Let C be a compact subset of a∗QqC and let X be the collection of ξ ∈ p(S +
(−S)) + Z∆r (P ) such that C ∩ Aσ,ξ 6= ∅ for some σ ∈ Π. Then it suffices to show
that X is finite.
    Let C ′ ⊂ a∗P qC be the image of Π × C under the map (σ, λ) 7→ p(σ1 λ − σ2 λ).
Then X equals the intersection of C ′ with p(S + (−S)) + Z∆r (P ). The latter
set is discrete since S is finite, whereas the elements of ∆r (P ) are linearly
independent. It follows that X is finite.                                         


Remark 6.4 In particular, it follows from the above lemma that a∗◦   QqC (P, S) is
a full open subset of a∗QqC ; see Appendix B for the notion of full.


Lemma 6.5 Let Q, P ∈ Pσ . If either aQq or aP q has codimension at most 1 in
aq , then the natural projection WP \W/WQ → W/ ∼P |Q is a bijection.
Proof: It suffices to prove injectivity of the map. Since s 7→ s−1 induces a
bijection from W/ ∼P |Q onto W/ ∼Q|P , it suffices to prove this when aP q has
codimension at most 1. We assume the latter to hold.

                                        41
     For s ∈ W, let [s] denote its canonical image in W/ ∼P |Q . Assume that
s, t ∈ W and that [s] = [t]. Then for every λ ∈ a∗Qq we have sλ = tλ on aP q .
If aP q = aq , this implies that s = t on a∗Qq , hence sWQ = tWQ , and since WP
is trivial in this case, the proof is finished. Thus, we may as well assume that
aP q has codimension 1. Then there exists a root α ∈ Σ such that aP q = ker α.
Note that WP = {1, sα }. For every λ ∈ a∗Qq the Weyl group images sλ and tλ
have equal length in a∗q and equal image under the orthogonal projection to α⊥ .
Hence there exists a constant η ∈ {0, 1} such that hsλ , αi = (−1)η htλ , αi for
all λ ∈ a∗Qq . It follows that sλ = sηα tλ for all λ ∈ a∗Qq ; hence sWQ = sηα tWQ ,
from which it follows in turn that s and t have the same image in WP \W/WQ .


   In particular, if P is minimal, then the natural map W/WQ → W/ ∼P |Q is
a bijection; we shall use it to identify the sets involved.


7    Analytic families of spherical functions
In this section we assume that (τ, Vτ ) is a finite dimensional continuous repre-
sentation of K. Let Q ∈ Pσ and let Y be a finite subset of ∗ a∗QqC , see (3.4).
    In the following definition we introduce a space of analytic families of τ -
spherical functions that will play a crucial role in the rest of this paper.

Definition 7.1 Let Q, Y be as above and let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be an open subset. We
define
                                   ep
                                  CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω)                                  (7.1)

to be the space of C ∞ -functions f : Ω × X+ → Vτ satisfying the following condi-
tions.
 (a) For every λ ∈ Ω the function fλ : x 7→ f (λ, x) belongs to C ∞ (X+ : τ ).
 (b) There exists a constant k ∈ N, and, for every P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ NK (aq ),
     a collection of functions qs,ξ (P, v | f ) ∈ Pk (aq ) ⊗ O(Ω, C ∞ (X0,v : τM )), for
     s ∈ W/WQ and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ), with the following property. For
     all λ ∈ Ω, m ∈ X0,v and a ∈ A+   q (P ),
                     X                     X
     fλ (mav) =            asλ−ρP                      a−ξ qs,ξ (P, v | f, log a)(λ, m),
                  s∈W/WQ            ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )
                                                                                     (7.2)

     where the ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series with coefficients in Vτ is
     neatly convergent on A+
                           q (P ).
 (c) For every P ∈ Pσmin , v ∈ NK (aq ) and s ∈ W/WQ , the series
                               X
                                         a−ξ qs,ξ (P, v | f, log a)
                          ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )


                                          42
      converges neatly on A+ q (P ) as a ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series with
      coefficients in O(Ω, C ∞ (X0,v : τM )).
         ep
If f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω), we define the asymptotic degree of f, denoted dega f,
to be the smallest number k ∈ N for which the above condition (b) is fulfilled.


Remark 7.2 We note that the space (7.1) depends on Q through its σ-split
component AQq . Moreover, from Lemma 3.6 we see that in the above definition
it suffices to require (b) and (c) for a fixed given P ∈ Pσmin and for each v in
a given set W ⊂ NK (aq ) of representatives for W/WK∩H . Alternatively, by the
same lemma it suffices to require (b) and (c) for a fixed given v ∈ NK (aq ) and
arbitrary P ∈ Pσmin.

                   ep
Lemma 7.3 Let f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω). Then fλ ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and

                   Exp(P, v | fλ ) ⊂ W (λ + Y ) − ρP − N∆(P )                  (7.3)

for all λ ∈ Ω, P ∈ Pσmin , and v ∈ NK (aq ). Moreover, let Ω′ : = Ω ∩ a∗◦
                                                                       QqC (P, W Y )
(see Definition 6.1). Then Ω′ is open dense in Ω and

                   qs,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ) = qsλ−ρP −ξ (P, v | fλ , X)           (7.4)

for every s ∈ W/WQ , ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ), X ∈ aq and λ ∈ Ω′ . In particular,
the functions qs,ξ (P, v | f ) are uniquely determined.
Proof: The first statement and (7.3) follow immediately from condition (b)
in the above definition. The set Ω′ is open dense in Ω by Lemma 6.3, and it
follows from Lemmas 6.2 and 6.5 that if λ ∈ Ω′ then the sets s(λ + WQ Y ) −
ρP − N∆(P ), s ∈ W/WQ , are mutually disjoint. Then (7.4) holds by uniqueness
of asymptotics.                                                            

   The following result shows that an element of CQ,Y   (X+ : τ : Ω) may be
viewed as an analytic family of spherical functions.

Lemma 7.4 Let f ∈ CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : Ω). Then λ 7→ fλ is a holomorphic function
on Ω with values in C ∞ (X+ : τ ).
Proof: Let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a complete set of representatives for W/WK∩H .
                                       −1                      ↓
Note that for v ∈ W the VτKM ∩vHv -valued function TP,v          fλ on A+q (P ) is
given by the series on the right-hand side of (7.2) with m = e. It follows
                                                ↓
from condition (c) of Definition 7.1 that a 7→ TP,v fλ (a) defines a smooth func-

                                                   . According to Appendix A,
                      ↓
the function λ 7→ TP,v fλ ( · ) is a holomorphic function on Ω with values in
                          −1                  ↓
C ∞ (A+

                KM ∩vHv
                               ). Hence λ 7→ TP,W (fλ ) is a holomorphic function on
                                                   −1
Ω with values in C ∞ (A+

                                              ). The conclusion of the lemma
now follows by application of the isomorphism (2.8).                       

   If Ω′ , Ω are open subsets of a∗qC with Ω′ ⊂ Ω, then restriction from Ω × X+
to Ω′ × X+ obviously induces a linear map

Accordingly, the assignment

defines a presheaf of complex linear spaces on a∗QqC . Here we agree that (7.6)
assigns the trivial space to the empty set.
    The following lemma will be useful at a later stage.

Lemma 7.5 Let Q ∈ Pσ and Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset.
 (a) If Ω′ , Ω are open subsets of a∗QqC with Ω′ 6= ∅, Ω connected and Ω′ ⊂
     Ω, then the restriction map (7.5) is injective. Moreover, dega (ρΩ
                                                                      Ω′ f ) =
                            ep
     dega (f ) for all f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω).
 (b) The presheaf (7.6) is a sheaf.

Proof: The injectivity of the restriction map follows by analytic continuation,
in view of Lemma 7.4. Let f ′ = ρΩ                min
                                  Ω′ f . Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ), s ∈ W/WQ
and ξ ∈ −sWQ λ + N∆(P ) then it follows from (7.4) that

                       qs,ξ (P, v | f ′ , · , λ) = qs,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ)        (7.7)

for λ in a dense open subset of Ω′ , hence for all λ ∈ Ω′ . In particular this
implies that the polynomial degree of the function on the left-hand side of
the equation is bounded by dega (f ); hence dega (f ′ ) ≤ dega (f ). To prove the
converse inequality, we note that the polynomial on the left-hand side of (7.7) is
of degree at most k ′ : = dega (f ′ ) by the definition of the latter number. Since Ω
is connected, it follows by analytic continuation that deg qs,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ) ≤ k ′
for all λ ∈ Ω. Since this holds for all P, v, σ, ξ, it follows that dega (f ) ≤ k ′ and
we obtain (a).
    Assertion (b) is equivalent with the assertion that the presheaf satisfies the
localization property (see [31], p. 9). This is established in a straightforward
manner, by using (a).                                                                 

    We shall now discuss the action of invariant differential operators on families.
                     ep
If f is a family in CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω), and D ∈ D(X), then we define the family
Df : Ω × X+ → Vτ by

                            (Df )λ = D(fλ ),            (λ ∈ Ω).                 (7.8)




                                              44
                            ep
Proposition 7.6 Let f ∈ CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : Ω). Then, for every D ∈ D(X), the
                      ep
family Df belongs to CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω); moreover, dega (Df ) ≤ dega (f ).
Proof: Let D ∈ D(X). Then g = Df is a smooth function Ω × X+ → Vτ ;
moreover, for λ ∈ Ω the function (Dg)λ = Dfλ is τ -spherical. Thus, g satisfies
condition (a) of Definition 7.1 and it remains to establish properties (b) and (c).
In view of Remark 7.2 it suffices to do this for v = e and arbitrary P ∈ Pσmin .
Let k: = dega f.
   It follows from condition (b) of Definition 7.1 that, for λ ∈ Ω, the function
fλ belongs to C ep (X+ : τ ); moreover, its (P, e)-expansion is given by
                X                   X
  fλ (ma) =           asλ−ρP                    a−ξ qs,ξ (P, e | f, log a)(λ, m), (7.9)
              s∈W/WQ                  ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )

for a ∈ A+                                     ′
            q (P ) and m ∈ M. Let u: = µP (D) + u+ be the element of D1P
associated with D as in Proposition 4.10 with P in place of Q. In view of
Corollary 4.9 its expansion ep(u), defined as in (4.11), is the sum, as i ranges
over a finite index set I, of series of the form
                               X
                   ep(u)i =           a−ν ϕi,ν ⊗ Si,ν ⊗ ui,ν ⊗ vi,ν .
                                 ν∈N∆(P )

Here ϕi,ν ∈ C ∞ (Mσ ), Si,ν ∈ End(Vτ ), ui,ν ∈ U (mσ ) and vi,ν ∈ U (aq ), and
deg(ui,ν ) + deg(vi,ν ) ≤ d: = deg(D) for all i, ν. By Lemma 4.12, the function gλ
belongs to C ep (X+ : τ ), for λ ∈ Ω, and its (P, e) expansion results from (7.9) by
the formal application of the element ep(u). This gives, for λ ∈ Ω, m ∈ M and
a ∈ A+q (P ), the neatly converging exponential polynomial expansion
                        X                   X
         gλ (ma) =            asλ−ρP                   a−η q̃s,η (log a)(λ, m),
                      s∈W/WQ                η∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )

where q̃s,η is given by the following finite sum
                   X        X
q̃s,η (X)(λ, m): =                    ϕi,ν (m)Si,ν [ qs,ξ (P, e | f, X; Tsλ−ρP −ξ (vi,ν ), λ, m; ui,ν ) ],
                     i∈I       ν∈N∆(P )
                           ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )
                                ν+ξ=η


for λ ∈ Ω, X ∈ aq and m ∈ M. Here we have used Harish-Chandra’s convention
to indicate by a semicolon on the left or right-hand side of a Lie group variable
the differentiation on the corresponding side, with respect to that variable, by
elements of the appropriate universal enveloping algebra. Moreover, given γ ∈
a∗qC we have denoted by Tγ the automorphism of U (aq ) determined by Tγ (X) =
X + γ(X) for X ∈ aq .
     From the above formula it readily follows that q̃s,η (X, λ) is a smooth function
of (X, λ) with values in C ∞ (M, Vτ ); moreover, it is polynomial in X of degree
at most k and holomorphic in λ ∈ Ω. This establishes condition (b) of Definition
7.1 with v = e, arbitrary P ∈ Pσmin, and with
          qs,η (P, e | g) = q̃s,η ,       (s ∈ W/WQ , η ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P )).

                                                45
   For condition (c) we note that the series
                          X
                                     a−η qs,η (P, e | g, log a)             (7.10)
                      η∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )

arises from the series
                               X
                                            a−ξ qs,ξ (P, e | f, log a)      (7.11)
                         ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )


by the formal application of ep(u) conjugated with multiplication by a−sλ+ρP .
From this we see that (7.10) arises from (7.11) by the formal application of the
series              X         X
                          a−ν      ϕi,ν ⊗ Si,ν ⊗ ui,ν ⊗ vi,ν (λ),
                   ν∈N∆(P )        i∈I

with vi,ν (λ) = Tsλ−ρP (vi,ν ). We now observe that λ 7→ Tsλ−ρP |Ud (aQq ) is a
polynomial End(Ud (aQq ))-valued function, of degree at most d. Hence there
exists a finite set J and elements pj ∈ Pd (a∗Qq ) and Tj ∈ End(Ud (aQq )), for
j ∈ J, such that                             X
                         Tsλ−ρP |Ud (aQq ) =   pj (λ)Tj .
                                                  j∈J

Let Bi,ν,j be the continuous endomorphism of O(Ω, C ∞ (Mσ , Vτ )) defined by

               Bi,ν,j ψ(λ)(m) = pj (λ)ϕi,ν (m)Si,ν [ψ(λ)(m; ui,ν )].

Then the series (7.10) arises from the formal application of the series
                           X         X
                                 a−ν     Bi,ν,j ⊗ Tj (vi,ν )

with coefficients in End(O(Ω, C ∞ (Mσ , Vτ ))) ⊗ U (aQq ) to (7.11), viewed as a
series with coefficients in O(Ω, C ∞ (Mσ , Vτ )). It follows from Lemmas 1.9 and
1.10 that the resulting series is neatly convergent as a series on A+   q (P ) with
coefficients in O(Ω, C ∞ (Mσ , Vτ )). This establishes (c) with v = e and arbitrary
P ∈ Pσmin .                                                                      

   We will now describe the asymptotic behavior along walls for a family. If
P, Q ∈ Pσ and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q (see (6.1)), then for every subset Y ⊂ a∗qC we put

                    σ · Y : = {sη|aP q | s ∈ W, [s] = σ, η ∈ Y }.           (7.12)


Theorem 7.7 (Behavior along the walls). Let Q ∈ Pσ , Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-empty
                                                      ep
open subset and Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset. Let f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω) and let
k = dega (f ).


                                             46
  Let P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). Then Exp(P, v | fλ ) ⊂ W (λ + Y )|aP q − ρP −
N∆r (P ) for every λ ∈ Ω. Moreover, there exist unique functions

                qσ,ξ (P, v | f ) ∈ Pk (aP q ) ⊗ O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )),

for σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q and ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ), with the following property. For all
λ ∈ Ω, m ∈ XP,v,+ and a ∈ A+ P q (RP,v (m)
                                          −1
                                             ),

                σ∈W/∼P |Q            ξ∈−σ·Y +N∆r (P )
                                                                                      (7.13)

where the ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial series with coefficients in Vτ is neatly
convergent on A+ P q (RP,v (m)
                              −1
                                 ). In particular, if λ ∈ Ω′ : = Ω ∩ a∗◦
                                                                      QqC (P, W Y )
then

                qσ,ξ (P, v | f )(X, λ) = qσλ|aP q −ρP −ξ (P, v | fλ , X),             (7.14)

for X ∈ aP q .
    Finally, for each σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q and every R > 1, the series
                                X
                                          a−ξ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, log a)                  (7.15)
                       ξ∈−σ·Y +N∆r (P )


converges neatly on A+ P q (R
                              −1
                                 ) as a ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial series with
                      ∞
coefficients in O(Ω, C (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )).
Proof: Let P ∈ Pσ and let v ∈ NK (aq ). Fix a minimal parabolic subgroup
P1 ∈ Pσmin , contained in P. Fix a set WP,v ⊂ NKP (aq ) of representatives for
WP /WP ∩ vWK∩H v −1 . Then the natural map NK (aq ) → W induces an em-
bedding WP,v v ֒→ W/WK∩H . Therefore, we may fix a set W ⊂ NK (aq ) of
representatives for W/WK∩H containing WP,v v.
    Fix λ ∈ Ω for the moment. Then by Lemma 7.3, the function fλ belongs to
C ep (X+ : τ ), and Exp(P1 , w | fλ ) ⊂ W (λ + Y ) − ρP1 − N∆(P1 ), for every w ∈
NK (aq ). According to Theorem 3.5, for every u ∈ WP,v , the set Exp(P, v | fλ )P1 ,u
is contained in Exp(P1 , uv | fλ )|aP q . Hence, by of (3.20) with P and P1 in place
of Q and P, respectively, we infer that

              Exp(P, v | fλ )   ⊂ [W (λ + Y ) − ρP1 − N∆(P1 )]|aP q
                                = W (λ + Y )|aP q − ρP − N∆r (P ).                    (7.16)

   Notice that (7.14) is a consequence of (7.13), by Lemma 6.2. Therefore the
functions qσ,ξ (P, v | f ) are unique. We will now establish their existence.
   It follows form (7.16) that the elements of Exp(P, v | fλ ) are all of the form
σλ|aP q − ρP − ξ, with σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q and ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ). Fix such elements
σ and ξ. Then by transitivity of asymptotics, cf. Theorem 3.5, we have, for

where the ∆P (P1 )-exponential polynomial series in the variable b converges
neatly on ∗A+        ∗
                P q ( P1 ). It follows from condition (b) in Definition 7.1 that, for
ζ ∈ Exp(P1 , uv | fλ ),
                                           X
 qζ (P1 , uv | fλ , X + log b, m) =                 qs,µ (P1 , uv | f, X + log b)(λ, m).

Now assume that λ is contained in the full (cf. Lemma 6.3) subset Ω′ of Ω. Then,
if s ∈ W and µ ∈ −sWQ Y +N∆(P1 ) satisfy [sλ−ρP1 −µ]|aP q = σλ|aP q −ρP −ξ, it
follows that [s] = σ and µ|aP q = ξ, see Lemma 6.2. Hence, combining (7.17) and
(7.18) we infer that for λ ∈ Ω′ , u ∈ WP,v , X ∈ aP q , m ∈ M and b ∈ ∗A+    ∗
                                                                        P q ( P1 ),

It will be seen below that each inner sum in (7.19) converges neatly, so that the
separation of terms by the outer sum is justified. This formula will guide us
towards the definition of the functions qσ,ξ (P, v | f ).
    In the following we assume that s ∈ W/WQ and [s] = σ. For w ∈ W we
                                            KM ∩wHw −1
define the function Fs,w : A+
                            q (P1 ) × Ω → Vτ              by
                               X
            Fs,w (a, λ) =                 a−µ qs,µ (P1 , w | f, log a, λ)(e),
                         µ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P1 )

for a ∈ A+q (P1 ), λ ∈ Ω.
    The representation τ̃ : = 1 ⊗ τ of K on the complete locally convex space
O(Ω) ⊗ Vτ is smooth. We shall apply the results of Section 3, with τ̃ in place
of τ. The series defining Fs,w is a ∆(P1 )-exponential polynomial series with
coefficients in O(Ω) ⊗ Vτ . By condition (c) of Definition 7.1 it converges neatly
on A+                                                          ep  +
      q (P1 ); hence Fs,w may be viewed as an element of C (Aq (P1 ), [O(Ω) ⊗
               −1
Vτ ]KM ∩wHw ). In view of the isomorphism (2.9), there exists a unique function
Fs ∈ C ep (X+ : τ̃ ) such that TP↓1 ,w (Fs )(a) = Fs (aw) = Fs,w (a), for w ∈ W
and a ∈ A+    q (P1 ). From the definition of Fs it follows that Exp(P1 , w | Fs ) ⊂
sWQ Y − N∆(P1 ), for every w ∈ W. Moreover, for every w ∈ W and every

for X ∈ aP q , m ∈ X0,w and λ ∈ Ω. By transitivity of asymptotics, cf. Theorem
3.5, applied to Fs , we have that Exp(P, v | Fs )P1 ,u ⊂ σ · Y − N∆r (P ), for u ∈
WP,v . Moreover, by the same result it follows that, for ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ),

where the series on the right-hand side converges neatly as a ∆P (P1 )-exponential
polynomial series in the variable b ∈ ∗A+     ∗                            ∞

In particular, the asserted convergence of (7.19) follows.
    Substituting (7.20) in the right-hand side of (7.19) and using (7.21) we find,
for λ ∈ Ω′ , that

We are now ready to define the functions qσ,ξ (P, v | f ).
   Let 1 denote the trivial representation of K in C, and 1P its restriction to
KP . If s ∈ W/WQ , we define the function ϕs ∈ O(a∗QqC , C ∞ (XP,v,+ : 1P )) by

                                ϕs (λ, kbu) = bsλ−ρP1 ,                          (7.23)

                                               AP q ( P1 ).
and ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ) we define the function qσ,ξ (P, v | f ): aP q × Ω →
C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ) by
                                 X
     qσ,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ)(m) =       ϕs (λ, m) q−ξ (P, v | Fs , X, m)(λ), (7.24)
                                s∈W/WQ
                                  [s]=σ


for X ∈ aP q , λ ∈ Ω and m ∈ XP,v,+ .
    If 1 < R ≤ ∞, then the locally convex space C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R], O(Ω) ⊗ Vτ )
is naturally isomorphic with O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R], Vτ )), see Appendix A. The
isomorphism induces in turn a natural isomorphism of locally convex spaces
                C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τ̃P )) ≃ O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )).         (7.25)
In particular, for R = ∞, we obtain that C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τ̃P ) is naturally isomor-
phic with O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )). Thus, from (7.24) we deduce that qσ,ξ (P, v | f )
is an element of Pk (aP q ) ⊗ O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )).
    Combining (7.22), (7.23) and (7.24) we infer that (7.14) holds for X ∈ aP q ,
λ ∈ Ω′ . On the other hand, if λ ∈ Ω′ , then it follows from (3.9) with P and fλ
in place of Q and f, that, for R > 1, m ∈ XP,v,+ [R] and a ∈ A+     P q (R

                                            49
where the series converges neatly on A+    P q (R
                                                  −1
                                                     ), as a ∆r (P )-exponential poly-
nomial series with coefficients in Vτ (use (7.16) and Lemma 6.2). Substituting
(7.14) in (7.26) we obtain the identity (7.13) for λ ∈ Ω′ , m ∈ XP,v,+ [R] and
a ∈ A+ P q (R
              −1
                 ), with the convergence as asserted.
    Thus, it remains to show that the identity (7.13) extends to all λ ∈ Ω and
that the final assertion of the theorem holds. We will first establish the final
assertion.
    It follows from Theorem 3.5 that the series
                               X
                                          a−ξ q−ξ (P, v | Fs , log a)           (7.27)
                   ξ∈−sWQ Y |aP q +N∆r (P )


converges neatly on A+  P q (R
                               −1
                                   ) as a ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial series with
coefficients in the space (7.25). The series (7.15) arises as the sum over s ∈
W/WQ with [s] = σ of the series in (7.27) multiplied by ϕs . Since multiplica-
tion by ϕs induces a continuous linear endomorphism of the space (7.25), this
establishes the final assertion of the theorem.
    From the final assertion it follows that, for every R > 1, the series on the
right-hand side of (7.13) defines a holomorphic function of λ ∈ Ω, for every
m ∈ XP,v,+ [R] and a ∈ A+    P q (R
                                    −1
                                       ). For such m, a the function λ 7→ fλ (mav) is
holomorphic in λ ∈ Ω by Lemma 7.4; hence the identity (7.13) extends to all
λ ∈ Ω, by density of Ω′ in Ω.                                                      


Theorem 7.8 (Transitivity of asymptotics). Let Q, Ω, Y , f , P and v be as
in Theorem 7.7. Let P1 ∈ Pσmin be contained in P. Let σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q and

Moreover, for every s ∈ W/WQ with [s] = σ and every X ∈ aP q , the series

Proof: Fix u ∈ NKP (aq ). Moreover, we fix a set WP,v as in the beginning of
the proof of Theorem 7.7 such that it contains the element u. We will also use
the remaining notation of the proof of the mentioned theorem.



                                          50
    Using (7.20) we see that, via the natural isomorphism of O(Ω, C ∞ (X0,uv : τM ))
with C ∞ (X0,uv : τ̃M ), the series (7.29) may be identified with the series with co-
efficients in C ∞ (X0,uv : τ̃M ) that arises from the series on the right-hand side
of (7.21) by omitting the evaluation at m. The neat convergence of the latter
series was noted already. Moreover, the identity (7.28) follows by insertion of
(7.21) in the definition (7.24) of qσ,ξ .                                          

    The following result is an important consequence of ‘holomorphy of asymp-
totics.’

Lemma 7.9 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset and Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-
                            ep
empty open subset. Let f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω) and let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ), and
σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q .
   Let ξ ∈ −σ·Y +N∆r (P ) and assume that there exists a λ0 ∈ a∗◦
                                                               QqC (P, W Y )∩Ω
such that

                         σλ0 |aP q − ρP − ξ ∈ Exp(P, v | fλ0 ).                    (7.30)

Then there exists a full open subset Ω0 of Ω such that

                 σλ|aP q − ρP − ξ ∈ Exp(P, v | fλ ),          (∀λ ∈ Ω0 ).

Proof: From (7.30) combined with (7.14) it follows that the Pk (aP q )⊗C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )-
valued holomorphic function q: λ 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ) does not vanish at λ = λ0 .
Hence there exists a full open subset Ω1 ⊂ Ω such that q(λ) 6= 0 for all λ ∈ Ω.
Let Ω0 : = Ω1 ∩a∗◦
                QqC (P, W Y ), then the conclusion follows by application of (7.14).


    We end this section with a result describing the behavior of the functions
qσ,ξ under the action of NK (aq ). Let Q, P ∈ Pσ and u ∈ NK (aq ), and put
P ′ = uP u−1 . The left multiplication by u naturally induces a map W/ ∼P |Q →
W/ ∼P ′ |Q , which we denote by σ 7→ uσ. Moreover, the endomorphism Ad(u−1 )∗
of a∗qC restricts to a linear map a∗P qC → a∗P ′ qC , which we denote by η 7→ uη. With
these notations, if Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC is a finite subset and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q , then

                                  u(σ · Y ) = (uσ) · Y ;

see also (7.12). For v ∈ NK (aq ), let the map ρτ,u : C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ) → C ∞ (XP ′ ,uv,+ : τP ′ )
be defined by (3.24) with P in place of Q.
    If Ω ⊂ a∗QqC is an open subset, let Ad(u−1 )∗ ⊗1⊗ρτ,u denote the naturally in-
duced map from P (aP q )⊗O(Ω, C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )) to P (aP ′ q )⊗O(Ω, C ∞ (XP ′ ,uv,+ : τP ′ )).

Lemma 7.10 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset and Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-
                                ep
empty open subset. Let f ∈ CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : Ω). If P ∈ Pσ and u, v ∈ NK (aq ),
then for all σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q and ξ ∈ σ · Y,

            quσ,uξ (uP u−1 , uv | f ) = [Ad(u−1 )∗ ⊗ 1 ⊗ ρτ,u ]qσ,ξ (P, v | f ).

                                            51
Proof: From combining (7.14) and Lemma 3.6 it follows that there exists a
full open subset Ω0 of Ω such that, for λ ∈ Ω0 ,
        quσ,uξ (uP u−1 , uv | f, · , λ) = [Ad(u−1 )∗ ⊗ ρτ,u ]qσ,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ).
The result now follows by holomorphy of the above expressions in λ and density
of Ω0 .                                                                     



8    Asymptotic globality
In this section we introduce the notion of asymptotic globality of a spherical
function on X+ and of an analytic family of such functions. We discuss prop-
erties needed in the statement and proof of the vanishing theorem in the next
section.

Definition 8.1 Let P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). A function f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) is
said to be asymptotically global along (P, v) at an element ξ ∈ a∗P qC if, for every
X ∈ aP q , the Vτ -valued smooth function qξ (P, v | f, X) has a C ∞ -extension from
XP,v,+ to XP,v .


Remark 8.2 Since qξ (P, v | f, X) is polynomial in X, with values in C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ),
the requirement on qξ implies that qξ (P, v | f ) is a polynomial C ∞ (XP,v : τP )-
valued function on aP q .
    Note that for P minimal the condition of asymptotic globality along (P, v)
is automatically fulfilled, since XP,v,+ = XP,v .
    Finally, if f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ), then f is asymptotically global along (G, e) at
every exponent if and only if f extends smoothly to X (use Remark 1.6).
    The property of asymptotic globality is preserved under the action of D(X)
in the following fashion. If P ∈ Pσ , then by ∆r (P ) we denote the partial
ordering on a∗P qC , defined as in (1.6), with aP q and ∆r (P ) in place of a and ∆,
respectively.

Proposition 8.3 Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and D ∈ D(X). Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq )
and ξ0 ∈ a∗P qC . If f is asymptotically global along (P, v) at every exponent
ξ ∈ Exp(P, v | f ) with ξ0 ∆r (P ) ξ, then Df is asymptotically global along
(P, v) at ξ0 .
Proof: Let u: = µ′P (D) + u+ be the element of D1P associated with D as in
Proposition 4.10, with P in place of Q. The key idea in the present proof is
that u has a ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial expansion with coefficients that are
globally defined smooth functions on MP σ , by Cor. 4.9. More precisely, the
expansion ep(u) is a finite sum, as i ranges over a finite index set I, of terms of
the form                      X
                 ep(u)i =           a−ν ϕi,ν ⊗ Si,ν ⊗ ui,ν ⊗ vi,ν .
                             ν∈N∆r (P )


                                            52
Here ϕi,ν ∈ C ∞ (MP σ ), Si,ν ∈ End(Vτ ), ui,ν ∈ U (mP σ ) and vi,ν ∈ U (aP q ),
and deg(ui,ν ) + deg(vi,ν ) ≤ deg(D) for all i, ν. By Lemma 4.12, Df belongs to
C ep (X+ : τ ) and its (P, e)-expansion results from the (P, e)-expansion of f by
the formal application of the element ep(u). Hence the asymptotic coefficient of
ξ0 is given by the finite sum
                              X      X
qξ0 (P, e | Df )(X, m) =                 ϕi,ν (m)Si,ν [ qξ (P, e | f )(X; Tξ (vi,ν ), m; ui,ν ) ].
                           ξ∈Exp(P,e | f )   i∈I
                             ν∈N∆r (P )
                              ξ−ν=ξ0



Let now f satisfy the hypothesis of the proposition. The ξ ′ s occurring in the
above sum belong to ξ0 + N∆r (P ), hence satisfy ξ0 ∆r (P ) ξ. By hypothesis, the
associated coefficients qξ (P, e | f ) all extend smoothly to aP q ×MP σ , see Remark
8.2. Therefore, so does qξ0 (P, e | Df ). This establishes the result for arbitrary
P ∈ Pσ and the special choice v = e. The result with general v ∈ NK (aq ) now
follows by application of Lemma 3.6 (cf. Lemma 8.7 (a)).                           

   We shall also introduce a notion of asymptotic globality for families from
           ep
the space CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω) introduced in the previous section, with Ω ⊂ a∗QqC
an open subset.

Definition 8.4 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y a finite subset of ∗ a∗QqC and Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-
empty open subset. Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ) and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q .
                                      ep
    We will say that a family f ∈ CQ,Y   (X+ : τ : Ω) is σ-global along (P, v), if
there exists a dense open subset Ω0 of Ω, such that, for every λ ∈ Ω0 , the
function fλ is asymptotically global along (P, v) at each exponent ξ ∈ σλ|aP q +
σ · Y − ρP − N∆r (P ).


Remark 8.5 If Y1 and Y2 are finite subsets of ∗ a∗QqC with Y1 ⊂ Y2 , then obvi-
ously
                   ep                   ep
                 CQ,Y 1
                        (X+ : τ : Ω) ⊂ CQ,Y 2
                                              (X+ : τ : Ω).
If f belongs to the first of these spaces, then the condition of σ-globality along
(P, v) relative to Y1 is equivalent to the similar condition relative to Y2 . This is
readily seen by using Lemmas 6.2 and 6.3. From this we see that the notion of
σ-globality along (P, v) extends to the space
                   ep
                                          [         ep
                 CQ   (X+ : τ : Ω): =             CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω)
                                             Y ⊂∗ a∗
                                                   QqC finite




    The property of asymptotic globality for families is also stable under the
action of D(X).

Corollary 8.6 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y a finite subset of ∗ a∗QqC and Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-
empty open subset. Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ) and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q .

   Let f ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω) be σ-global along (P, v). Then for every D ∈ D(X)
                  ep
the family Df ∈ CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω) is σ-global along (P, v) as well.
                                                                    ep
Proof: It follows from Proposition 7.6 that Df belongs to CQ,Y         (X+ : τ : Ω).
According to Theorem 7.7, both sets Exp(P, v | fλ ) and Exp(P, v | Dfλ ) are con-
tained in the set Eλ : = W (λ + Y )|aP q − ρP − N∆r (P ), for every λ ∈ Ω.
    Let Ω0 be as in Definition 8.4. Then the set Ω′0 : = Ω0 ∩ a∗◦
                                                               QqC (P, W Y ) is open
dense in Ω by Lemma 6.3. Let λ ∈ Ω′0 and let ξ0 ∈ σλ|aP q + σ · Y − ρP −
N∆r (P ). If ξ ∈ Exp(P, v | fλ ) satisfies ξ0  ξ, then ξ ∈ σλ|aP q + σ · Y − ρP −
N∆r (P ) by Lemma 6.2. By hypothesis, fλ is asymptotically global along (P, v)
at the exponent ξ. It now follows by application of Proposition 8.3 that Dfλ is
asymptotically global along (P, v) at ξ0 .                                        

   The following lemma describes the behavior of asymptotic globality under
the action of NK (aq ).

Lemma 8.7 Let P ∈ Pσ and u, v ∈ NK (aq ). Put P ′ = uP u−1 and v ′ = uv.
 (a) Let f ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ) and ξ ∈ a∗P qC . If f is asymptotically global along
     (P, v) at ξ, then f is asymptotically global along (P ′ , v ′ ) at uξ.
 (b) Let Q ∈ Pσ , Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-empty open subset, Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite
                     ep
     subset, f ∈ CQ,Y   (X+ : τ : Ω) and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q . If f is σ-global along
     (P, v), then f is uσ-global along (P ′ , v ′ ).

Proof: From (3.24) with P in place of Q it is readily seen that ρτ,u maps
C ∞ (XP,v : τP ) to C ∞ (XP ′ ,v′ : τP ′ ). Then (a) and (b) follow immediately from
Lemmas 3.6 and 7.10, respectively.                                                 

    We end this section with the following result, which shows that the globality
condition is fulfilled for a certain natural class of τ -spherical functions. From
the text preceding Lemma 5.5 we recall that b is a maximal abelian subspace
of q containing aq and that if µ ∈ b∗C , then by Iµ we denote the kernel of the
character γ( · : µ) of D(X). Thus Iµ is an ideal in D(X) of codimension one (over
C).

Proposition 8.8 Let µ ∈ b∗C and let f ∈ E(X : τ : Iµ ). Then f |X+ ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ).
Moreover, this function is asymptotically global along all pairs (P, v) ∈ Pσ ×
NK (aq ) and at all exponents ξ ∈ a∗P qC .
Proof: The first statement follows immediately from Lemma 5.3. By Lemma
8.7 (a) it suffices to consider v = e and arbitrary P ∈ Pσ . Let ψ ∈ Vτ be
fixed. Then it suffices to prove that the scalar valued function m 7→ qξ (X, m): =
hqξ (P, e|f, X, m) | ψi on XP,+ has a C ∞ extension to XP , for each ξ ∈ a∗P qC ,
X ∈ aP q . It follows from Theorem 3.4 that
                                        X
                      hf (ma) | ψi =            aξ qξ (log a, m).            (8.1)
                                   ξ∈Y −N∆r (P )



                                        54
On the other hand, it follows from [5], Lemma 12.3, that [5], Thm. 12.8 can be
applied to the K-finite function F : x 7→ hf (x) | ψi. By uniqueness of asymp-
totics (see Lemma 1.7 and its proof) the expansion (8.1) coincides with that
of [5], Thm. 12.8. We conclude that, in the notation of loc. cit., qξ (X, m) =
pµ|aq ,ξ (P |F, m, X) for all X ∈ aP q , m ∈ XP,+ . The function x 7→ pµ|aq ,ξ (P |F, x, X)
is smooth on G. From this the smooth extension of qξ (X, m) follows immedi-
ately.                                                                                 



9     A vanishing theorem
In this section we formulate and prove the vanishing theorem. We assume that
Q is a σ-parabolic subgroup containing Aq .
     As before, let b be a maximal abelian subspace of q containing aq . By ∗ aQq
and ∗ bQ we denote the orthocomplements of aQq in aq and b, respectively. Let
bk : = b ∩ k; then
                                ∗
                                  bQ = bk ⊕ ∗ aQq .
We write DQ for the collection of functions δ: ∗ b∗QC → N with finite support
supp δ. For δ ∈ DQ we put
                                    X
                             |δ|: =       δ(ν).
                                        ν∈supp δ

For δ ∈ DQ and λ ∈ a∗QqC we define the ideal Iδ,λ in D(X) as the following
product of ideals
                                 Y
                        Iδ,λ : =     (Iν+λ )δ(ν) .                    (9.1)
                                      ν∈supp δ

If δ = 0, this ideal is understood to be the full ring D(X). Being a product of
cofinite ideals in the Noetherian ring D(X), the ideal Iδ,λ is cofinite.

Definition 9.1 Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a non-empty open subset and δ ∈ DQ . For
every finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC we define

                                 EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)                             (9.2)
                                  ep
to be the space of families f ∈ CQ,Y  (X+ : τ : Ω) (cf. Def. 7.1) such that for
every λ ∈ Ω the function fλ : x 7→ f (λ, x) is annihilated by the cofinite ideal
(9.1). Moreover, we define
                                     [
           EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ): =               EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ).
                                    Y ⊂∗ a∗
                                          QqC finite



    Note that the space (9.2) depends on Q through its σ-split component AQq .
If ν ∈ ∗ b∗QC , we denote by δν the characteristic function of the set {ν}. Then

                                           55
δν ∈ DQ . Moreover, if δ ∈ DQ and ν ∈ supp δ, then δ − δν ∈ DQ and |δ − δν | =
|δ| − 1.

Lemma 9.2 Let f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ).
 (a) If D ∈ D(X) then Df ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ).
 (b) If D ∈ D(X) and ν ∈ supp δ then the function g: Ω × X+ → Vτ defined by

            g(λ, x): = [D − γ(D : ν + λ)]fλ (x),       (λ ∈ Ω, x ∈ X+ ),        (9.3)

      belongs to EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ − δν ).

                                                                           ep
Proof: Let D ∈ D(X). By Proposition 7.6, the family Df belongs to CQ,Y         (X+ : τ : Ω).
                               ′              ′             ′            ′
Moreover, if λ ∈ Ω and D ∈ Iδ,λ , then D (Df )λ = D Dfλ = DD fλ = 0 and
we see that assertion (a) holds.
    The function λ 7→ γ(D : ν + λ) is polynomial on a∗QqC , hence holomorphic on
                                                                     ep
Ω and it follows that G: (λ, x) 7→ γ(D : ν+λ)f (λ, x) belongs to CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : Ω).
Hence g = Df − G belongs to the latter space as well. Furthermore, if D′ ∈
Iδ−δν ,λ , then D′′ : = D′ (D −γ(D : ν +λ)) ∈ Iδ,λ , and we see that D′ gλ = D′′ fλ =
0. Hence (b) holds.                                                                 


Remark 9.3 It follows from Lemma 9.2 (a) that (7.8) defines a representation
of D(X) in EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ), leaving the subspaces EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ) invari-
ant.


Lemma 9.4 Let Q ∈ Pσ , δ ∈ DQ and Ω a connected non-empty open subset
                            ep
of a∗QqC . Assume that f ∈ CQ  (X+ : τ : Ω). If fλ is annihilated by Iδ,λ for λ in a
                          ′
non-empty open subset Ω of Ω, then f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ).
                                                                ep
Proof: Fix a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC such that f ∈ CQ,Y          (X+ : τ : Ω). We
proceed by induction on |δ|.
      First, assume that |δ| = 0. Then Iδ,λ = D(X) for all λ and hence f |Ω′ ×X+ = 0.
Since Ω is connected, this implies that f = 0, see Lemma 7.4.
      Next assume that |δ| = k ≥ 1 and assume the result has already been
established for all δ ∈ DQ with |δ| < k. Fix ν ∈ supp δ and put δ ′ = δ − δν , then
                                                                    ep
|δ ′ | < k. Let D ∈ D(X) and define g as in (9.3). Then g ∈ CQ,Y        (X+ : τ : Ω),
as seen in the proof of Lemma 9.2. On the other hand, it follows from (b) of
that lemma that g|Ω′ ×X+ ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω′ : δ ′ ). Hence g ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ ′ )
by the induction hypothesis. Fix λ ∈ Ω. Then it follows, for D′ ∈ Iδ′ ,λ , that
D′ (D − γ(D : ν + λ))fλ = D′ gλ = 0. Since D was arbitrary, we conclude that
fλ is annihilated by the ideal Iδ′ ,λ Iν+λ = Iδ,λ .                                




                                         56
  We define the following subset of Pσ , consisting of the parabolic subgroups
whose σ-split rank is of codimension one,
                      Pσ1 : = {P ∈ Pσ | dim aq / dim aP q = 1}.


Definition 9.5 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-empty open subset and δ ∈ DQ .
By EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob we denote the space of functions f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)
satisfying the following condition.
    For every s ∈ W and every P ∈ Pσ1 with s(aQq ) 6⊂ aP q , the family f is
    [s]-global along (P, v), for all v ∈ NK (aq ); here [s] denotes the image of s
    in W/∼P |Q = WP \W/WQ .
If Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC is a finite subset, we define
     EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob : = EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ) ∩ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob .


Remark 9.6 Note that EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob depends on Q through its σ-split
component aQq .
   The equality W/∼P |Q = WP \W/WQ follows from Lemma 6.5. Note that the
condition s(aQq ) 6⊂ aP q on s factors to a condition on its class in WP \W/WQ .
    The following result reduces the globality condition of Definition 9.5 to a
condition involving a smaller set of (s, P ) ∈ W × Pσ1 . Its formulation requires
some more notation.
    Let ∆ be a fixed basis for the root system Σ, let Σ+ be the associated system
of positive roots and a+q the associated open positive chamber. Let P0 be the
unique element of Pσmin with ∆(P0 ) = ∆. A σ-parabolic subgroup Q is said to
be standard if it contains P0 ; of course then Q ∈ Pσ . Given such a Q, we write
∆Q for the subset of ∆ consisting of the roots vanishing on aQq and ∆(Q) for
its complement.
    If α is any root in ∆, we write nα for the sum of the root spaces gβ where
β ranges over the set Σ+ \ Nα. Moreover, we put Nα : = exp(nα ) and write M1α
for the centralizer in G of the root hyperplane ker α. Then Pα = M1α Nα is the
standard parabolic subgroup with ∆Pα = {α}. We write Pα = Mα Aα Nα and
Pα = Mσα Aαq Nα for the Langlands and σ-Langlands decompositions of Pα ,
respectively. Accordingly, aαq = ker α and ∗ aαq = (ker α)⊥ . Finally, we write
Wα = WPα for the centralizer of ker α in W.

Lemma 9.7 Let Q ∈ Pσ be a standard parabolic subgroup, Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-
empty open subset, δ ∈ DQ and f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ). Then f belongs to
EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob if and only if the following condition is fulfilled.
    For every s ∈ W and every α ∈ ∆ with s−1 α|aQq 6= 0, the family f is
    [s]-global along (Pα , v), for all v ∈ NK (aq ); here [s] denotes the image of
    s in W/∼Pα |Q = Wα \W/WQ .


                                           57
Proof: We must show that the condition of Definition 9.5 is fulfilled if and
only if the above condition holds. For this we first observe that for α ∈ ∆ and
s ∈ W,
                       s−1 α|aQq 6= 0 ⇐⇒ s(aQq ) 6⊂ aαq .
The ‘only if part’ is now immediate. For the ‘if part’, assume that the above
condition is fulfilled. Let (s, P ) ∈ W ×Pσ1 be such that s(aQq ) 6⊂ aP q . There exist
α ∈ ∆ and t ∈ W such that tP t−1 = Pα . It follows that ts(aQq ) 6⊂ taP q = ker α,
hence (ts)−1 α = α ◦ (ts) is not identically zero on aQq . From the hypothesis it
now follows that f is [ts]-global along (tP t−1 , v), for all v ∈ NK (aq ). By Lemma
8.7 it follows that f is [s]-global along (P, w), for all w ∈ NK (aq ).              


Lemma 9.8 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Ω ⊂ a∗QqC a non-empty open subset and δ ∈ DQ . Then
the space EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob is D(X)-invariant. Moreover, EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob
is a D(X)-submodule, for every finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC .
Proof: This follows from combining the D(X)-invariance of the space EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)
with Proposition 8.3.                                                       


Definition 9.9 Let Q ∈ Pσ . An open subset Ω of a∗QqC will be called Q-
distinguished if it is connected and if for every α ∈ Σ(Q) the function λ 7→
hRe λ , αi is not bounded from above on Ω.
   In particular, a connected open dense subset of a∗QqC is Q-distinguished.
In the following theorem we assume that Q W ⊂ NK (aq ) is a complete set of
representatives for WQ \W/WK∩H .

Theorem 9.10 (Vanishing theorem). Let Q ∈ Pσ and δ ∈ DQ . Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC
be a Q-distinguished open subset and let f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob . Assume that
there exists a non-empty open subset Ω′ ⊂ Ω such that, for each v ∈ Q W,

                      λ − ρQ ∈
                             / Exp(Q, v | fλ ),       (λ ∈ Ω′ ).                 (9.4)

Then f = 0.
     The proof of this theorem will be given after the following lemmas on which
it is based. We may and shall assume that Q is standard. Thus, Q contains the
minimal standard σ-parabolic subgroup P0 which will be denoted by P in the
rest of this section.

Lemma 9.11 Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a non-empty connected open subset, δ ∈ DQ
and assume that |δ| = 1. Let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC be a finite subset and let f ∈
EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ). Moreover, let v ∈ NK (aq ) and assume that there exist
t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y, µ ∈ N∆ and u ∈ NKQ (aq ) such that

                          λ + tη − ρ − µ ∈ Exp(P, uv | fλ )                      (9.5)


                                          58
for λ in some non-empty open subset of Ω. Then there exists a full open subset
Ω0 ⊂ Ω such that
                       λ − ρQ ∈ Exp(Q, v | fλ ),      (λ ∈ Ω0 ).

Proof: Let ν ∈ ∗ b∗QC be the unique element such that supp δ = {ν}. Fix t, η, µ
and u with the mentioned property. Replacing µ by a ∆ -smaller element if
necessary we may in addition assume that µ is ∆ -minimal subject to the condi-
tion that (9.5) holds for λ in some non-empty open subset of Ω. By holomorphy
of asymptotics, see Lemma 7.9, it follows that (9.5) holds for λ in a full open
subset Ω′ of Ω. Moreover, using the minimality of µ and applying Lemma 6.2
we see that for every λ in the full open subset Ω0 : = Ω′ ∩ a∗◦
                                                             QqC (P, W Y ) of Ω,

                         λ + tη − ρ − µ ∈ ExpL (P, uv | fλ ).
Since fλ is annihilated by Iδ,λ = Iν+λ , this implies, in view of Lemma 5.5, that
there exists a finite subset L ⊂ b∗kC such that
                   ν + λ ∈ W (b)(L + λ + tη − µ),         (λ ∈ Ω0 ).
For Λ0 ∈ L, w ∈ W (b) we define Ω0 (Λ0 , w) to be the set of λ ∈ Ω0 satisfying
                            ν + λ = w(Λ0 + λ + tη − µ).                          (9.6)
The union of these sets, as Λ0 ∈ L, w ∈ W (b), equals Ω0 . By finiteness of the
union, we may select Λ0 and w such that Ω0 (Λ0 , w) has a non-empty interior in
Ω0 . Since Ω0 (Λ0 , w) is also the intersection of Ω0 with an affine linear subspace of
b∗C , it must be all of Ω0 . Hence for all λ1 , λ2 ∈ Ω0 we have w(λ1 − λ2 ) = λ1 − λ2 .
Since Ω0 is a non-empty open subset of a∗QqC this implies that w belongs to
WQ (b), the centralizer of aQq in W (b). From (9.6) we now deduce that −wµ =
ν − wΛ0 − wtη. The expression on the right-hand side of this equality has zero
restriction to aQq . Therefore, so has wµ, and we conclude that also µ|aQq = 0.
Combining this fact with (9.5) and transitivity of asymptotics, see Theorem 3.5,
we conclude that
                   λ − ρQ = [λ + tη − ρ − µ]|aQq ∈ Exp(Q, v | fλ ),
for all λ ∈ Ω0 .                                                                    

   For the formulation of the next lemma, we need the following definition.

Definition 9.12 Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC and s0 ∈ W be given. The subset W (Ω, s0 ) of
W is defined as follows. Let s′ ∈ W . Then s′ ∈ W (Ω, s0 ) if and only if there
exists a chain s1 , . . . , sk = s′ of elements in W , with sj s−1
                                                                j−1 = sαj a simple
reflection, such that the following condition (9.7) holds for each of the pairs
(s, α) = (sj−1 , αj ) ∈ W × ∆, j = 1, . . . , k.
    If s−1 α|aQq 6= 0 then λ 7→ Re hsλ , αi is not bounded from below on Ω.
                                                                          (9.7)


                                          59
   Notice that if Ω is dense in a∗QqC , then W (Ω, s0 ) = W for all s0 ∈ W .
Indeed, (9.7) is then fulfilled by all elements α ∈ ∆. Hence, in order to verify the
conditions of Definition 9.12 for s′ ∈ W arbitrary, we may choose as sα1 , . . . , sαk
the elements in a reduced expression s′ s−1 0 = sαk · · · sα1 .


Lemma 9.13 Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a non-empty connected open subset, Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC
a finite subset, and δ ∈ DQ . Let f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob and s ∈ W. Assume
that there exist t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y , µ ∈ N∆ and w ∈ NK (aq ) such that
                        sλ + stη − ρ − µ ∈ Exp(P, w | fλ ),                     (9.8)
for all λ in some non-empty open subset of Ω. Then for every s1 ∈ W (Ω, s)
there exist t1 ∈ WQ , η1 ∈ Y, µ1 ∈ N∆ and w1 ∈ NK (aq ), such that
                     s1 λ + s1 t1 η1 − ρ − µ1 ∈ Exp(P, w1 | fλ ),               (9.9)
for all λ in a full open subset of Ω. In particular, if Ω is dense in a∗QqC , then the
above conclusion holds for every s1 ∈ W .
Proof: In the proof we will frequently use the following consequence of Lemma
7.9, based on holomorphy of asymptotics. If s1 ∈ W, t1 ∈ WQ , η1 ∈ Y, µ1 ∈ N∆
and w1 ∈ NK (aq ), then (9.9) holds for λ in a full open subset of Ω as soon as it
holds for a fixed λ in the full open subset Ω ∩ a∗◦QqC (P, W Y ) of Ω. We now turn
to the proof.
    If s1 = s, or more generally, if s1 ∈ sWQ , then the conclusion readily follows
by the previous remark. By Definition 9.12 we now see that it suffices to prove
the lemma for s1 = sα s, with α ∈ ∆ such that (9.7) holds. There are two
cases to consider, namely that s−1 α|a∗Qq equals zero or not. In the first case,
s1 = sss−1 α ∈ sWQ and the conclusion is valid. We may thus assume that we
are in the second case, i.e., s1 = sα s with
                                   s−1 α|a∗Qq 6= 0.                            (9.10)
We will complete the proof by showing that the following assumption leads to
a contradiction.
    Assumption: for all t1 ∈ WQ , η1 ∈ Y, µ1 ∈ N∆ and w1 ∈ NK (aq ) there
exists no non-empty open subset Ω′ of Ω such that (9.9) holds for λ ∈ Ω′ .
    Let Ξ be the set of elements (stη − µ)|aαq with t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y, µ ∈ N∆ such
that (9.8) holds for λ in a non-empty open subset of Ω, for some w ∈ NK (aq ).
Then Ξ is a non-empty subset of a∗αqC contained in a set of the form X−N∆r (Pα ),
with X ⊂ a∗αqC finite. Hence we may select t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y and µ ∈ N∆ such
that (stη − µ)|aαq is ∆r (Pα ) -maximal in Ξ. According to the first paragraph of
the proof, there exists w ∈ NK (aq ) such that (9.8) is valid for λ in a full open
subset Ω0 of Ω. For λ ∈ Ω0 we put
                           ξ(λ) = [sλ + stη − ρ − µ]|aαq .
Then by transitivity of asymptotics, see Theorem 3.5, it follows that
                              ξ(λ) ∈ Exp(Pα , w | fλ )

                                         60
for λ ∈ Ω0 . In the following we shall investigate the coefficient of the expansion
of fλ along (Pα , w), for λ ∈ Ω0 , given by

                          ϕλ (m): = qξ(λ) (Pα , w | fλ , · , m).

Here ϕλ is a non-trivial τPα -spherical function on Xα,w,+ with values in Pk (aαq ),
for k = dega f , see Thm. 3.4 (b).
    It follows from (9.10) and the asymptotic globality assumption on f, see
Lemma 9.7, that actually ϕλ extends to a smooth function on Xα,w , for every
λ in an dense open subset Ω′0 of Ω0 . This observation will play a crucial role at
a later stage of this proof.
    Let
                     Ω1 : = Ω′0 ∩ a∗◦               ∗◦
                                   QqC (P, W Y ) ∩ aQqC (Pα , W Y ).

The second and third set in this intersection are full open subset of a∗QqC , see
Lemma 6.3. Hence Ω1 is a dense open subset of Ω. We claim that for λ ∈ Ω1
the following holds. If s′ ∈ W, t′ ∈ WQ , η ′ ∈ Y, µ′ ∈ N∆ and w′ ∈ NK (aq ) are
such that
                ′
                 s λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ ∈ Exp(P, w′ | fλ ) and
                                                                          (9.11)
                 ξ(λ) ∆r (Pα ) (s′ λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ )|aαq ,

then

                s′ ∈ sWQ     and    (s′ t′ η ′ − µ′ )|aαq = (stη − µ)|aαq .       (9.12)

To prove the claim, let s′ , t′ , η ′ , µ′ , w′ satisfy (9.11). Then there exists a ν ∈
N∆(Pα ) such that s′ λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ − ν and sλ + stη − ρ − µ have the same
restriction ξ(λ) to aαq . By the definition of Ω1 this implies that s′ and s define
the same class in W/ ∼Pα |Q , see Lemma 6.2. The latter set equals Wα \W/WQ ,
by Lemma 6.5, hence s′ belongs to sα sWQ = s1 WQ or to sWQ . In the first
case it follows that s′ λ = s1 λ, hence s1 λ + s1 t′′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ ∈ Exp(P, w′ | fλ ) for
some t′′ ∈ WQ . This assertion then holds for λ in a full open subset of Ω1 ,
contradicting the above assumption.
     It follows that we are in the second case s′ ∈ sWQ , hence s′ = st′′ for some
t ∈ WQ . The element (s′ t′ η ′ − µ′ )|aαq = (st′′ t′ η ′ − µ′ )|aαq therefore belongs to
 ′′

Ξ; from (9.11) it follows that it dominates the maximal element (stη − µ)|aαq ,
hence is equal to that element. This implies (9.12), hence establishes the claim.
     It follows from the above claim that, for λ ∈ Ω1 , the exponent ξ(λ) is actually
a leading exponent of fλ along (Pα , w). To see this, let λ ∈ Ω1 and let ξ ∈
Exp(Pα , w | fλ ) be an exponent with ξ(λ) ∆r (Pα ) ξ. Then, in view of Theorem
3.5, there exist s′ ∈ W, t′ ∈ WQ , η ′ ∈ Y and µ′ ∈ N∆ such that the element
s′ λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ restricts to ξ on aαq and belongs to Exp(P, w′ | fλ ) for some
w′ ∈ W. It now follows from the claim established above that ξ = ξ(λ).
     Thus, we see that ξ(λ) is a leading exponent indeed. Consequently, by
Lemma 5.7 the function ϕλ is D(Xα,w )-finite, for every λ ∈ Ω1 . We proceed by
investigating the exponents of its expansion.


                                           61
    Select a complete set Wα,w of representatives for Wα /(Wα ∩ WK∩wHw−1 ) in
NK (aq ). We put ∗ P = P ∩Mα . Then by transitivity of asymptotics, cf. Theorem
3.5, we see that for the set of (∗ P, u)-exponents of ϕλ , as u ∈ Wα,w , the following
inclusion holds:

       Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ ) ⊂ {ξ|∗ aαq | ξ ∈ Exp(P, uw | fλ ) ξ|aαq = ξ(λ)|aαq }.

Hence, for λ ∈ Ω1 , every exponent in Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ ) is of the form (s′ λ+s′ t′ η ′ −
ρ − µ′ )|∗ aαq with s′ ∈ W, t′ ∈ WQ , η ′ ∈ Y and µ′ ∈ N∆ satisfying
                      ′
                        s λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ ∈ Exp(P, uw | fλ ),
                        [s′ λ + s′ t′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ ]|aαq = ξ(λ)|aαq .

It follows from the claim established above that (9.12) holds.
    We have thus shown that for every λ ∈ Ω1 the exponents in Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ )
are of the form (sλ + st′ η ′ − ρ − µ′ )|∗ aαq with t′ ∈ WQ , η ′ ∈ Y, µ′ ∈ N∆
satisfying
                         [st′ η ′ − µ′ ]|aαq = [stη − µ]|aαq .
From this it follows that the restriction µ′ |aαq of the µ′ occurring runs through
a finite subset of N∆r (Pα ) = N[∆ \ {α}]|aαq , independent of λ. Hence there
exists a finite subset S ′ ⊂ N∆ such that µ′ runs through S ′ − Nα. We thus see
that there exists a finite subset S ⊂ ∗ a∗αqC such that, for every λ ∈ Ω1 ,

                  ∪u∈Wα,w Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ ) ⊂ sλ|∗ aαq + S − Nα.                 (9.13)

From (9.7) and (9.10) it now follows that we may select a non-empty open subset
Ω2 of the dense open subset Ω1 of Ω such that, for every λ ∈ Ω2 , each u ∈ Wα,w
and all ξ ∈ Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ ),

                                 hRe ξ + ∗ ρ , αi < 0.

Since ϕλ is D(Xα,w )-finite this implies that ϕλ is square integrable on Xα,w , see
[3], Thm. 6.4 with p = 2; hence ϕλ a Schwartz function for λ ∈ Ω2 , see [3],
Thm. 7.3.
    On the other hand, from (9.10) it follows that the linear map λ 7→ sλ|∗ aαq
is surjective from a∗QqC onto ∗ a∗αqC . Therefore, the set {sλ|∗ aαq | λ ∈ Ω2 } has
a non-empty interior in ∗ a∗αqC . Combining this observation with (9.13) we in-
fer that there exists a non-empty open subset Ω3 ⊂ Ω2 , such that the sets
∪u∈Wα,w Exp(∗ P, u | ϕλ ), for λ ∈ Ω3 , are mutually disjoint. Now these sets are
non-empty, since ϕλ 6= 0, for λ ∈ Ω3 . Therefore, the union of these sets, as
λ ∈ Ω3 , is uncountable. This contradicts Lemma 5.8, applied to the space Xα,w .

Lemma 9.14 Assume that Ω ⊂ a∗QqC is Q-distinguished. Then e ∈ W (Ω, s0 )
for all s0 ∈ W .


                                          62
Proof: Let k = l(s0 ) denote the length of s0 , and let s0 = sα1 · · · sαk be a
reduced expression for s0 . Put sj = sαj · · · sα1 s0 = sαj+1 · · · sαk for j = 1, . . . , k,
then sk = e. We claim that (9.7) holds for each pair (s, α) = (sj−1 , αj ). Since
                                 −1
l(sj ) = l(sj−1 ) − 1, the root sj−1 αj must be negative. Hence the restriction of
this root to aQq is zero or belongs to −Σ(Q). Now (9.7) follows immediately
from Definition 9.9.                                                                       

    Proof of Theorem 9.10: We prove the result by induction on |δ|. If δ = 0,
then for λ ∈ a∗QqC the ideal Iδ,λ equals D(X); hence EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob = 0
and the result follows.
    Let now |δ| = 1, let f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob and let (9.4) be fulfilled for
all v ∈ Q W. Assume that f 6= 0. We will show that this assumption leads
to a contradiction. There exists a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC such that f ∈
EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob and a λ0 ∈ Ω ∩ a∗◦
                                           QqC (P, W Y ) such that fλ0 6= 0. Let
W be a complete set of representatives of W/WK∩H in NK (aq ) containing Q W.
Then Exp(P, w | fλ0 ) 6= ∅ for some w ∈ W. In view of (7.3) it follows that there
exist s ∈ W, t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y and µ ∈ N∆, such that

                          sλ + stη − ρ − µ ∈ Exp(P, w | fλ ),                         (9.14)

for λ = λ0 . From Lemma 7.9 it follows that (9.14) is valid for λ in a full open
subset of Ω. By Lemmas 9.13 and 9.14 this implies that there exist t1 ∈ WQ , η1 ∈
Y, µ1 ∈ N∆ and w1 ∈ NK (aq ), such that λ + t1 η1 − ρ − µ1 ∈ Exp(P, w1 | fλ ) for
λ in a full open subset of Ω. Let v ∈ Q W be the representative of WQ w1 WK∩H .
By Lemma 9.11 it follows that λ− ρQ ∈ Exp(Q, v | fλ ) for λ in a full open subset
Ω0 of Ω. Since Ω0 ∩ Ω′ is non-empty, we obtain a contradiction with (9.4).
    Now suppose that |δ| = k > 1, and assume that the result has already
been established for δ ∈ DQ with |δ| < k. Fix ν ∈ supp (δ) and put δ ′ =
δ − δν . Then δ ′ ∈ DQ ; moreover, |δν | = 1 and |δ ′ | = k − 1. Fix any D ∈
D(X) and define the family g by (9.3). Then g ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ ′ ) by Lemma
9.2. Moreover, it readily follows from Lemma 9.8 that the family g belongs to
EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ ′ )glob .
    For λ ∈ Ω and v ∈ NK (aq ) we have

                     Exp(Q, v | gλ ) ⊂ Exp(Q, v | fλ ) − NΣr (Q),                     (9.15)

in view of Lemma 4.12 (b). Moreover, by hypothesis we have the following
inclusion, for every λ ∈ Ω′ ,

       Exp(Q, v | fλ ) ⊂ [W (λ + Y )|aQq − ρQ − NΣr (Q)] \ {λ − ρQ }.                 (9.16)

Combining (9.15) and (9.16) we infer that Exp(Q, w | gλ ) does not contain λ−ρQ
for λ ∈ Ω′ and every w ∈ NK (aq ). Consequently, the family g satisfies the
hypotheses of Theorem 9.10. Since |δ ′ | = k − 1, it follows from the induction
hypothesis that g = 0. Since D was arbitrary, we see that fλ is annihilated
by Iδν ,λ , for every λ ∈ Ω. Hence f belongs to EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δν )glob . Since
|δν | = 1 < k, it now follows from the induction hypothesis that f = 0.        

                                             63
   The following result is also based on Lemma 9.13.

Corollary 9.15 Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a connected dense open subset, Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a
finite subset, and δ ∈ DQ . Let f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob and s1 ∈ W . If

                  (s1 λ + W Y − ρ − N∆) ∩ Exp(P, w | fλ ) = ∅,

for all λ in a non-empty open subset of Ω and for all w ∈ NK (aq ), then f = 0.
Proof: Assume that f 6= 0. Then there exists an element λ ∈ Ω ∩ a∗◦
                                                                 QqC (P, W Y )
such that fλ 6= 0, and then

                        sλ + stη − ρ − µ ∈ Exp(P, w | fλ )                         (9.17)

for some s ∈ W , t ∈ WQ , η ∈ Y , µ ∈ N∆ and w ∈ NK (aq ). As remarked in
the beginning of the proof of Lemma 9.13, (9.17) then holds for all λ in a full
open subset of Ω. Hence Lemma 9.13 applies; its final statement contradicts
the present assumption for s1 .                                              

   Finally in this section we will show that for a family in EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)
that allows a smooth extension to X, the hypothesis of asymptotic globality can
be left out in the vanishing theorem. Let

      EQ (X : τ : Ω : δ) = {f ∈ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ) | fλ ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ), λ ∈ Ω}.


Corollary 9.16 Let Q ∈ Pσ and δ ∈ DQ . Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a Q-distinguished
open subset and let f ∈ EQ (X : τ : Ω : δ). Assume that there exists a non-empty
open subset Ω′ ⊂ Ω such that, for each v ∈ Q W,

                      λ − ρQ ∈
                             / Exp(Q, v | fλ ),       (λ ∈ Ω′ ).

Then f = 0.
Proof: As in the proof of Theorem 9.10 we proceed by induction on |δ|. If
|δ| = 0 the result is trivial. If |δ| = 1 it follows from Proposition 8.8 that
EQ (X : τ : Ω : δ) ⊂ EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob , and then the result follows directly
from Theorem 9.10.
    Now suppose that |δ| = k > 1, and assume that the result has already been
established for all δ ∈ DQ with |δ| < k. Let δ ′ and g be as in the proof of
Theorem 9.10. Then it is easily seen that g ∈ EQ (X : τ : Ω : δ ′ ).
    For the rest of the proof we can now proceed exactly as in the proof of
Theorem 9.10.                                                                    

10     Laurent functionals
In this section we define Laurent functionals and describe their actions on suit-
able spaces of meromorphic functions.
    Throughout this section, V will be a finite dimensional real linear space,
equipped with a (positive definite) inner product h · , · i. Its complexification
VC is equipped with the complex bilinear extension of this inner product.
    Let X be a (possibly empty) finite set of non-zero elements of V. At this
stage we allow proportionality between elements of X. By an X-hyperplane in
VC , we mean an affine hyperplane of the form H = a + α⊥ C
                                                           , with a ∈ VC , α ∈ X.
The hyperplane is called real if a can be chosen from V, or, equivalently, if it is
the complexification of a real hyperplane from V. A locally finite collection of
X-hyperplanes in VC is called an X-configuration in VC . It is called real if all its
hyperplanes are real.
    If a ∈ VC , we denote the collection of X-hyperplanes in VC through a
by H(a, X) = H(VC , a, X). If E is a complete locally convex space, then by
M(a, X, E) = M(VC , a, X, E) we denote the ring of germs of E-valued mero-
morphic functions at a whose singular locus at a is contained in H(a, X). Here
and in the following we will suppress the space E in the notation if E = C.
Thus, M(a, X) = M(a, X, C).
    Let NX denote the set of maps X → N. If d ∈ NX , we define the polynomial
function πa,d = πa,X,d : VC → C by
                              Y
                   πa,d (z) =     hξ , z − aid(ξ) , (z ∈ VC ).                (10.1)
                              ξ∈X


If X = ∅ then NX has one element which we agree to denote by 0. We also agree
that πa,0 = 1. Let Oa (E) = Oa (VC , E) denote the ring of germs of E-valued
holomorphic functions at a. Then
                                            −1
                        M(a, X, E) = ∪d∈NX πa,d Oa (E).

In the following we shall identify S(V ) with the algebra of constant coefficient
holomorphic differential operators on VC in the usual way;    in particular an
                                                           d 
element v ∈ V corresponds to the operator ϕ 7→ vϕ(z) = dτ      τ =0
                                                                    ϕ(z + τ v).

Definition 10.1 (Laurent functional at a point) An X-Laurent functional at
a is a linear functional L: M(a, X) → C such that for every d ∈ NX there exists
an element ud ∈ S(V ) such that

                               Lϕ = ud (πa,d ϕ)(a),                           (10.2)
             −1
for all ϕ ∈ πa,d Oa . The space of all Laurent functionals at a is denoted by
M(a, X)laur = M(VC , a, X)∗laur .
         ∗




                                         65
Remark 10.2 Obviously, the string (ud )d∈NX of elements from S(V ) is uniquely
determined by the requirement (10.2). We shall denote it by uL .
   If E is a complete locally convex space, then X-Laurent functionals at a
may naturally be viewed as linear maps from M(a, X, E) to E. Indeed, let
L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur and let uL = (ud )d∈NX be the associated string of elements
                    −1
from S(V ). If ϕ ∈ πa,d Oa (E) then Lϕ is given by formula (10.2).
     Let Ta : z 7→ z + a denote translation by a in VC . Then Ta maps H(0, X)
bijectively onto H(a, X). Pull-back under Ta induces an isomorphism of rings
Ta∗ : ϕ 7→ ϕ ◦ Ta from Oa onto O0 . Therefore, pull-back under Ta also induces an
isomorphism of rings Ta∗ : M(a, X) → M(0, X). By transposition we obtain an
isomorphism of linear spaces Ta∗ : M(0, X)∗ → M(a, X)∗ . It is readily seen that
Ta∗ (πa,d ) = π0,d for every d ∈ NX . From the definition of Laurent functionals
it now follows that Ta∗ maps M(0, X)∗laur isomorphically onto M(a, X)∗laur .
Moreover,
                                    uTa∗ L = uL
for all L ∈ M(0, X)∗ .
    Let X ′ be another finite collection of non-zero elements of V. We say that
X and X ′ are proportional if H(0, X) = H(0, X ′ ).

Lemma 10.3 Let X, X ′ be proportional finite subsets of V \{0} and let a ∈ VC .
Then M(a, X) = M(a, X ′ ) and M(a, X)∗laur = M(a, X ′ )∗laur .
Proof: It is obvious that M(a, X) = M(a, X ′ ). Let L ∈ M(a, X)∗ =
M(a, X ′ )∗ , and assume that L ∈ M(a, X ′ )∗laur . Let (ud′ )d′ ∈NX ′ be the asso-
                                                                              ′
ciated string. Let d ∈ NX . Then, by proportionality, there exists d′ ∈ NX and
c ∈ R \ {0} such that πa,X,d = cπa,X ′ ,d′ . Let ud = c−1 ud′ , then (10.2) follows
immediately. This shows that L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur and establishes the inclusion
M(a, X ′ )∗laur ⊂ M(a, X)∗laur . The converse inclusion is proved similarly.     

    Following the method of [10], Sect. 1.3, we shall now give a description of
the space of strings uL , as L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur .
    Put ̟d : = π0,d and equip the space NX with the partial ordering  defined
by d′  d if and only if d′ (ξ) ≤ d(ξ) for every ξ ∈ X. If d′  d then we define
d − d′ componentwise as suggested by the notation. In [10], Sect. 1.3, we defined
the linear space S← (V, X) as follows. Let d, d′ ∈ NX with d′  d. If u ∈ S(V ),
then by the Leibniz rule there exists a unique u′ ∈ S(V ) such that

                     u(̟d−d′ ϕ)(0) = u′ (ϕ)(0),      (ϕ ∈ O0 ).

We denote the element u′ by jd′ ,d (u). The map jd′ ,d : S(V ) → S(V ) thus defined
is linear. Note that it only depends on d − d′ ; note also that, for d, d′ , d′′ ∈ NX
with d′′  d′  d,
                               jd′′ ,d′ ◦ jd′ ,d = jd′′ ,d .
We now define S← (V, X) as the linear space of strings (ud )d∈NX in S(V ) such
that jd′ ,d (ud ) = ud′ for all d, d ∈ NX with d′  d. Thus, this space is the

                                         66
projective limit:
                              S← (V, X) = lim(S(V ), j· ).
                                             ←

The natural map S← (V, X) → S(V ) that maps a string to its d-component is
denoted by jd .

Lemma 10.4 The map L 7→ uL is a linear isomorphism from M(a, X)∗laur onto
S← (V, X).
Proof: See [11], Appendix B, Lemma B.2.                                                 


Lemma 10.5 Let a ∈ VC , d ∈ NX and u ∈ S(V ). Then there exists a Laurent
functional L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur such that (uL )d = u.
Proof: See [10], Lemma 1.7.                                                             


Remark 10.6 In particular, it follows that for each a ∈ VC there exists a
Laurent functional L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur such that Lϕ = ϕ(a) for all ϕ ∈ Oa . Note
however, that this functional is not unique, unless X = ∅.


Lemma 10.7 Let M(a, X)∗O                                                  ∗
                          laur denote the annihilator of Oa in M(a, X)laur .
                                                                ∗O
Then all functions ϕ in M(a, X), that are annihilated by M(a, X)laur , belong
to Oa .
Proof: We may assume that a = 0. Let ϕ ∈ M(0, X) and assume that
ϕ 6∈ O0 . Then there exist elements d, d′ ∈ NX and ξ ∈ X such that π0,d′ = ξπ0,d
and π0,d′ ϕ ∈ O0 but π0,d ϕ 6∈ O0 . Here we have written ξ also for the function
z 7→ hξ , zi on VC . Since π0,d′ ϕ is not divisible by ξ, its restriction to ξ ⊥ = ξ −1 (0)
does not vanish. Hence there exists u ∈ S(ξ ⊥ ) such that u(π0,d′ ϕ)(0) 6= 0. By
Lemma 10.5 there exists an element L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur such that the d′ term of
uL is u. Then Lϕ = u(π0,d′ ϕ)(0) 6= 0. However, for each ψ ∈ O0 we have
Lψ = u(π0,d′ ψ)(0) = [ξu(π0,d ψ)](0) = 0. Hence L ∈ M(a, X)∗O          laur .            

   We extend the notion of a Laurent functional as follows. The disjoint union of
the spaces M(a, X)∗laur as a ∈ VC is denoted by M(∗, X)∗laur = M(VC , ∗, X)∗laur .
By a section of M(∗, X)∗laur we mean a map L: VC → M(∗, X)∗laur with La ∈
M(a, X)∗laur for all a ∈ VC . The closure of the set {a ∈ VC | La 6= 0} is called
the support of L and denoted by supp (L).

Definition 10.8 (Laurent functional) An X-Laurent functional on VC is a
finitely supported section of M(∗, X)∗laur. The set of X-Laurent functionals is
denoted by M(VC , X)∗laur and equipped with the obvious structure of a linear
space.


                                            67
     Is S is a subset of VC , we define the space M(S, X)∗laur = M(VC , S, X)∗laur
by
                M(S, X)∗laur = {L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur | supp L ⊂ S}
and call this the space of X-Laurent functionals on VC supported in S.


Remark 10.9 Note that, for a ∈ VC , the map M({a}, X)∗laur → M(a, X)∗laur ,
defined by L 7→ La , is a linear isomorphism. Accordingly we shall view M(a, X)∗laur
as a linear subspace of M(VC , X)∗laur . In this way M(S, X)∗laur becomes identi-
fied with the algebraic direct sum of the linear spaces M(a, X)∗laur , as a ∈ S, for
S any subset of VC . Accordingly, if L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur , then La ∈ M(a, X)∗laur ⊂
M(VC , X)∗laur for a ∈ VC , and
                                         X
                                    L=         La .

Lemma 10.10 Let X and X ′ be proportional finite subsets of V \ {0}. Then

                         M(VC , X)∗laur = M(VC , X ′ )∗laur .

Proof: This is an immediate consequence of Lemma 10.3 and the above defi-
nition.                                                               

    We proceed by discussing the action of a Laurent functional on meromorphic
functions. Let E be a complete locally convex space and Ω ⊂ VC an open subset.
If a ∈ Ω, then by M(Ω, a, X, E) we denote the space of meromorphic functions
ϕ: Ω → E whose germ ϕa at a belongs to M(a, X, E). If S ⊂ Ω, we define

                      M(Ω, S, X, E): = ∩a∈S M(Ω, a, X, E).

Finally, we write M(Ω, X, E) for M(Ω, Ω, X, E). In particular, M(VC , X, E) de-
notes the space of functions ϕ ∈ M(VC , E) with singular locus sing(ϕ) contained
in an X-configuration.
    There is a natural pairing M(S, X)∗laur × M(Ω, S, X, E) → E, given by
                                     X
                               Lϕ =         La ϕa .                       (10.3)

Lemma 10.11 Let S ⊂ VC be arbitrary, and let Ω be an open subset of VC
containing S. Then the pairing given by (10.3) for E = C induces a linear
embedding
                       M(S, X)∗laur ֒→ M(Ω, S, X)∗ .



                                         68
Proof: Let L ∈ M(S, X)∗laur and assume that L = 0 on M(Ω, S, X). We may
assume that S = supp L. For every a ∈ S we write ua = (uad )d∈NX for the string
determined by La .
   Select b ∈ S. Then it suffices to prove that Lb = 0. Fix d ∈ NX and φ ∈ Ob .
Then it suffices to show that ubd (φ)(b) = 0.
                                                                          −1
   For every a ∈ S \ {b} we may select d(a) ∈ NX such that πa,d(a) πb,d       is
holomorphic at a. Moreover, we put d(b) = d. For a ∈ S there exists a unique
va ∈ S(V ) such that for all f ∈ Oa we have
                                                       −1
                         va (f )(a) = uad(a) (πa,d(a) πb,d f )(a).

We note that vb = ubd . We may now apply the lemma below, with Ea = Cva , for
a ∈ S, and, finally with ξa = 0 if a 6= b and with ξb defined by ξb (vb ) = vb (φ)(b).
Hence there exists a polynomial function ψ on VC such that va (ψ)(a) = 0 for all
a ∈ S \ {b}, and such that vb (ψ)(b) = vb (φ)(b).
                 −1
   Define ϕ = πb,d  ψ. Then ϕ ∈ M(Ω, S, X). Hence Lϕ = 0. On the other hand,
      X                X
                                −1              −1
Lϕ =      La ϕa =          La (πa,d(a) πa,d(a) πb,d ψ)

                   =         uad(a) (πa,d(a) πb,d ψ)(a) =         va (ψ)(a) = vb (ψ)(b) = ubd (φ)(b).
                       a∈S                                  a∈S

It follows that ubd (φ)(b) = 0.                                                             


Lemma 10.12 Let S ⊂ VC be a finite set. Suppose that for every a ∈ S a
finite dimensional complex linear subspace Ea ⊂ S(V ) together with a complex
linear functional ξa ∈ Ea∗ is given. Then there exists a polynomial function ψ
on VC such that uψ(a) = ξa (u) for every a ∈ S and all u ∈ Ea .
Proof: This result is well known.                                                           

     We proceed by discussing the push-forward of a Laurent functional by an
injective linear mapping. Let V0 be a real linear space and ι: V0 → V an injective
linear map. We assume that no element of X is orthogonal to ι(V0 ). We
equip V0 with the pull-back of the inner product of V under ι and denote
the corresponding transpose of ι by p. Then X0 : = p(X) consists of non-zero
elements. We denote the complex linear extensions of ι and p by the same
symbols. Then, if H ⊂ VC is an X-hyperplane, its preimage ι−1 (H) is an
X0 -hyperplane of V0C .
     Let a0 ∈ V0C and put a = ι(a0 ). Then pull-back by ι induces a natural
algebra homomorphism ι∗ : Oa (VC ) → Oa0 (V0C ). On the other hand, pull-back
by p induces a natural algebra homomorphism p∗ : Oa0 (V0C ) → Oa (VC ). From
p ◦ ι = IV0 it follows that ι∗ ◦ p∗ = I on Oa0 (V0C ), hence ι∗ is surjective.
     If d: X → N is a map, then we write p∗ (d) for the map X0 → N defined by
                                            X
                            p∗ (d)(ξ0 ) =            d(ξ).
                                           ξ∈X,p(ξ)=ξ0


                                            69
One readily verifies that for every d: X → N we have

                                ι∗ (πa,X,d ) = πa0 ,X0 ,p∗ (d) .                       (10.4)

Let E be a complete locally convex space. Then it follows that pull-back by ι
induces a linear map

                       ι∗ : M(VC , a, X, E) → M(V0C , a0 , X0 , E).                    (10.5)


Lemma 10.13 The linear map ι∗ in (10.5) is surjective.
Proof: Let d0 : X0 → N be a map. Then one readily checks that there exists a
map d: X → N such that d0 = p∗ (d). From this it follows that

  πa−1
     0 ,X0 ,d0
                                    −1
               Oa0 (V0C , E) = ι∗ (πa,X,d                                −1
                                          ) ι∗ p∗ (Oa0 (V0C , E)) ⊂ ι∗ (πa,X,d Oa (VC , E)).

where the first equality follows from (10.4).                                                  

  The pull-back map ι∗ in (10.5) with E = C has a transpose ι∗ : M(V0C , a0 , X0 )∗ →
M(VC , a, X)∗ which is injective by Lemma 10.13.

Lemma 10.14 The map ι∗ maps M(V0C , a0 , X0 )∗laur injectively into M(VC , a, X)∗laur .
Proof: Let L ∈ M(V0C , a0 , X0 )∗laur . Then it suffices to show that ι∗ L belongs
to the space M(VC , a, X)∗laur .
    We first note that ι: V0 → V has a unique extension to an algebra homo-
morphism ι∗ : S(V0 ) → S(V ). One readily verifies that u[ι∗ (ϕ)] = ι∗ (ι∗ (u)ϕ) for
every ϕ ∈ Oa (VC ) and all u ∈ S(V0 ). Let d be a map X → N. Then there exists
a ud ∈ S(V0 ) such that L = eva0 ◦ ud ◦ πa0 ,X0 ,p∗ (d) on πa−1
                                                              0 ,X0 ,p∗ (d)
                                                                            Oa0 (V0C ); here
eva0 denotes evaluation at the point a0 . Put vd = ι∗ (ud ). Then, for ϕ ∈ Oa (VC ),
        −1
ι∗ (L)[πa,X,d ϕ] = L[ι∗ (πa,X,d )−1 ι∗ ϕ)] = L[πa−1
                                                  0 ,X0 ,p∗ d
                                                              ι∗ ϕ] = ι∗ (vd ϕ)(a0 ) = vd ϕ(a).
                                     −1
Hence ι∗ (L) = eva ◦ vd ◦ πa,X,d on πa,X,d Oa (VC ) and we see that ι∗ (L) ∈ M(VC , a, X)∗laur .


     There exists a unique linear map ι∗ : M(V0C , X0 )∗laur → M(VC , X)∗laur that
restricts to the map ι∗ of Lemma 10.14 for every a0 ∈ V0C , see Remark 10.9.
Clearly, supp (ι∗ L) = ι(supp (L)), for every L ∈ M(V0C , X0 )∗laur .
     On the other hand, if E is a complete locally convex space, Ω ⊂ VC open
subset and S ⊂ ι−1 (Ω) a subset, then pull-back by ι induces a natural map
ι∗ : M(Ω, ι(S), X, E) → M(ι−1 (Ω), S, X0 , E). Moreover, if L ∈ M(V0C , S, X0 )∗laur
and ϕ ∈ M(Ω, ι(S), X, E), then

                                     ι∗ (L)ϕ = L[ι∗ ϕ].                                (10.6)

   We end this section with a discussion of the multiplication by a meromorphic
function and the application of a differential operator to a Laurent functional.

                                              70
   First, assume that a ∈ VC and that ψ ∈ M(a, X). Then multiplication
by ψ induces a linear endomorphism of M(a, X), which we denote by mψ .
The transpose of this linear endomorphism is denoted by m∗ψ : M(a, X)∗ →
M(a, X)∗ . It readily follows from the definition of X-Laurent functionals at a
that m∗ψ leaves the space M(a, X)∗laur of those functionals invariant.
   Let now S ⊂ VC be a finite subset, let Ω ⊂ VC be an open subset containing
S and let ψ ∈ M(Ω, S, X). If L ∈ M(VC , S, X)∗laur , we define the Laurent
functional m∗ψ (L) ∈ M(VC , S, X)∗laur by
                                         X
                             m∗ψ (L) =         m∗ψa (La ).
                                         a∈S

On the other hand, multiplication by ψ induces a linear endomorphism of
M(Ω, S, X), and it is immediate from the definitions that

                               m∗ψ (L)(ϕ) = L(ψϕ)                              (10.7)

for ϕ ∈ M(Ω, S, X).

Lemma 10.15 Let v ∈ S(V ), then vϕ ∈ M(a, X) for all ϕ ∈ M(a, X), and the
transpose ∂v∗ of the endomorphism ∂v : ϕ 7→ vϕ of M(a, X) leaves M(a, X)∗laur
invariant.
Proof: We may assume v ∈ V . Let d ∈ NX and define d′ ∈ NX by d′ (ξ) =
d(ξ) + 1 for all ξ ∈ X. Then πa,d divides v(πa,d′ ), and hence

                      πa,d′ vϕ = v(πa,d′ ϕ) − v(πa,d′ )ϕ ∈ Oa
             −1                         −1                −1
for all ϕ ∈ πa,d Oa . Thus ∂v ϕ = vϕ ∈ πa,d ′ Oa for ϕ ∈ πa,d Oa .

    Let now L ∈ M(a, X)∗laur , and let u = uL ∈ S← (V, X). Then for d, d′ and ϕ
as above

   ∂v∗ L(ϕ) = L(vϕ) = ud′ (πa,d′ vϕ)(a) = ud′ v(πa,d′ ϕ)(a) − ud′ (v(πa,d′ )ϕ)(a).

Each term on the right hand side of this equation has the form u′ (pϕ)(a) with
u′ ∈ S(V ) and p a polynomial which is divisible by πa,d . Hence, by the Leibniz
rule, ∂v∗ L(f ) has the required form u′′ (πa,d ϕ)(a), where u′′ ∈ S(V ).     

   For L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur and v ∈ S(V ) we now define ∂v∗ L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur by
                                     X
                            ∂v∗ L =        ∂v∗ La .
                                      a∈supp L

It is immediately seen that ∂v∗ L(ϕ) = L(∂v ϕ) for each ϕ ∈ M(Ω, supp L, X),
where Ω is an arbitrary open neighborhood of supp L.

11     Laurent operators
In this section we discuss Laurent operators, originally introduced in [10], Sec-
tion 5, in the slightly different context of meromorphic functions with values
in a complete locally convex space, whose singular locus is contained in an
X-configuration.
    Let V and X be as in the previous section, let H be an X-configuration and
let E be a complete locally convex space.
    We define M(VC , H, E) to be the space of meromorphic functions ϕ: VC → E
whose singular locus is contained in ∪H. If H is real, we put HV = {H ∩V | H ∈
H}. Then M(VC , H) = M(VC , H, C) equals the space M(V, HV ) introduced in
[10].
    It is convenient to select a minimal subset X 0 of X that is proportional to
X. Then for every X-hyperplane H ⊂ VC there exists a unique αH ∈ X 0 and a
unique first order polynomial lH of the form z 7→ hαH , zi − c, with c ∈ C, such
            −1
that H = lH    (0). Note that a different choice of X 0 causes only a change of lH
by a non-zero factor.
    Let NH denote the collection of maps H → N.

Remark 11.1 If d ∈ NH , then for convenience we agree to write d(H) = 0 for
any X-hyperplane H not contained in H.
   If ω ⊂ VC is a bounded subset and d ∈ NH we define the polynomial function
πω,d : VC → C by
                                      Y d(H)
                             πω,d =       lH                           (11.1)
                                        H∈H
                                       H∩ω6=∅


Note that a change of X 0 only causes this polynomial to be multiplied by a
positive factor. Let M(VC , H, d, E) be the collection of meromorphic functions
ϕ ∈ M(VC , E) such that πω,d ϕ ∈ O(ω, E) for every bounded open subset ω ⊂
VC . We equip the space M(VC , H, d, E) with the weakest locally convex topology
such that for every bounded open subset ω ⊂ VC the map map ϕ 7→ πω,d ϕ is
continuous into O(ω, E). This topology is complete; moreover, it is Fréchet if E
is Fréchet.
    We now note that

                     M(VC , H, E) = ∪d∈NH M(VC , H, d, E).                 (11.2)

We equip NH with the partial ordering  defined by d′  d if and only if
d′ (H) ≤ d(H) for all H ∈ H. If d, d′ are elements of NH with d′  d then
M(VC , H, d′ , E) ⊂ M(VC , H, d, E) and the inclusion map id′ ,d is continuous.
Thus, the inclusion maps form a directed family and from (11.2) we see that the
space M(VC , H, E) may be viewed as the direct limit of the spaces M(VC , H, d, E).
Accordingly we equip M(VC , H, E) with the direct limit locally convex topology.
    By an X-subspace of VC we mean any non-empty intersection of X-hyperplanes;
we agree that VC itself is also an X-subspace. We denote the set of such affine

                                       72
subspaces by A = A(VC , X). For L ∈ A there exists a unique real linear sub-
                                                                              ⊥
space VL ⊂ V such that L = a + VLC for some a ∈ VC . The intersection VLC        ∩L
consists of a single point, called the central point of L; it is denoted by c(L).
The space L is said to be real if c(L) ∈ V ; this means precisely that L is the
complexification of an affine subspace of V. Translation by c(L) induces an affine
isomorphism from VLC onto L. Via this isomorphism we equip L with the struc-
ture of a complex linear space together with a real form that is equipped with
an inner product.
    If L ∈ A, the collection of X-hyperplanes containing L is finite; we denote
this collection by H(L, X). Moreover, we put X(L): = X ∩ VL⊥ and X 0 (L): =
X 0 ∩VL⊥ . From the definition of X 0 it follows that the map H 7→ αH is a bijection
from H(L, X) onto X 0 (L). Accordingly we shall identify the sets NH(L,X) and
    0
NX (L) . If H is any X-configuration and d ∈ NH , we define the polynomial
function qL,d by                           Y       d(H)
                              qL,d : =            lH ,
                                      H∈H(L,X)

see also Remark 11.1. Let Xr be the orthogonal projection of X \ X(L) onto VL ;
then Xr is a finite set of non-zero elements. Its image in L under translation by
c(L) is denoted by XL . If H is an X-configuration in VC , then the collection

                    HL : = {H ∩ L | H ∈ H, ∅ $ H ∩ L $ L}

is an XL -configuration in L; here L is viewed as a complex linear space in the
way described above.
    We now assume that L ∈ A and that H is an X-configuration in VC . In
accordance with [10], Sect. 1.3, a linear map R: M(VC , H) → M(L, HL ) is called
a Laurent operator if for every d ∈ HN there exists an element ud ∈ S(VL⊥ ) such
that

                 Rϕ = ud (qL,d ϕ)|L    for all   ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, d).           (11.3)

The space of such Laurent operators is denoted by Laur (VC , L, H).
    Assume now in addition that H contains H(L, X). Then as in loc. cit. it is
seen that, for R ∈ Laur (VC , L, H) and d ∈ NH , the element ud ∈ S(VL⊥ ) such
that (11.3) holds, is uniquely determined. Moreover, it only depends on the
restriction of d to H(L, X), and the associated string uR : = (ud | d ∈ NH(L,X) )
belongs to S← (VL⊥ , X 0 (L)). As in to [10], Lemma 1.5, the map R 7→ uR defines
a linear isomorphism

                       Laur (VC , L, H) ≃ S← (VL⊥ , X 0 (L)).                (11.4)

If E is a complete locally convex space, and R ∈ Laur (VC , L, H) a Laurent
operator, we may define a linear operator RE from M(VC , H, E) to M(L, HL , E)
by the formula (11.3), for ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, d, E) and with ud equal to the d-
component of uR . We shall often denote RE by R as well.



                                        73
Remark 11.2 Here we note that the algebraic tensor product M(VC , H) ⊗ E
naturally embeds onto a subspace of M(VC , H, E) which is dense. Thus, RE is
the unique continuous linear extension of R ⊗ IE . However, we shall not need
this.


Lemma 11.3 Let L ∈ A and let H be an X-configuration in VC containing
H(L, X). Let R ∈ Laur (VC , L, H). Then for every d ∈ NH there exists a d′ ∈
NHL with the following property. For every complete locally convex space E the
operator RE maps M(VC , H, d, E) continuously into the space M(L, HL , d′ , E).
Proof: This is proved in a similar fashion as [10], Lemma 1.10.                  

    We shall now relate Laurent operators to the Laurent functionals introduced
in the previous section. Let Xr0 be a minimal subset of Xr subject to the condi-
tion that it be proportional to Xr . Let XL0 be its image in L under translation by
c(L). Thus, with respect to the linear structure of L, the set XL0 is an analogue
for the pair (L, XL ) of the set X 0 for the pair (V, X).

Lemma 11.4 Let L ∈ A and let H be an X-configuration in VC containing
H(L, X). Let E be a complete locally convex space.
 (a) If ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, E), then for w ∈ L \ ∪HL the function z 7→ ϕ(w + z) is
                       ⊥                                       ⊥
     meromorphic on VLC  , with a germ at 0 that belongs to M(VLC , 0, X(L), E).

                  ⊥
 (b) If L ∈ M(VLC   , 0, X(L))∗laur is an X(L)-Laurent functional in VLC
                                                                      ⊥
                                                                         , sup-
     ported at the origin, then for ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, E) the function
                                L∗ ϕ: w 7→ L(ϕ(w + · ))                     (11.5)
     belongs to the space M(L, HL , E). The operator L∗ : M(VC , H) → M(L, HL ),
     defined by (11.5) for E = C, is a Laurent operator.
 (c) The map L 7→ L∗ , defined by (11.5) for E = C, is an isomorphism from
                      ⊥
     the space M(VLC    , 0, X(L))∗laur onto the space Laur (VC , L, H). This iso-
     morphism corresponds with the identity on S← (VL⊥ , X 0 (L)), via the iso-
     morphisms of Lemma 10.4 and eq. (11.4).

Proof: See [11], Appendix B, Lemma B.3.                                          


                                                                      ⊥
Remark 11.5 In the formulation of (c) we have used that the spaces M(VLC , 0, X(L))∗laur
       ⊥        0    ∗
and M(VLC , 0, X (L))laur are equal, see Lemma 10.3.
                                                                              ⊥
    We now assume that H is an X-configuration, and that L ∈ A. If a ∈ VLC      ,
                                                          ′
then by HL (a) we denote the collection of hyperplanes H in L for which there
exists a H ∈ H such that H ′ = L ∩ [(−a) + H]. Thus, HL (a) = (T−a H)L and
                                                    ⊥
we see that HL (a) is an XL -configuration. If S ⊂ VLC is a finite subset, then
                              HL (S) = ∪a∈S HL (a)                          (11.6)


                                        74
is an XL -configuration in L as well. The corresponding set of regular points in
L equals

     L \ ∪HL (S) = {w ∈ L | ∀a ∈ S ∀H ∈ H: a + w ∈ H ⇒ a + L ⊂ H}.


                                                                   ⊥
Corollary 11.6 Let L ∈ A and let H be an X-configuration. Let S ⊂ VLC be
a finite subset and let E be a complete locally convex space.
 (a) For every ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, E) and each w ∈ L\∪HL (S), there exists an open
                               ⊥
     neighborhood Ω of S in VLC   such that the function ϕ(w + · ): z 7→ ϕ(w + z)
     belongs to M(Ω, X(L), E).
                   ⊥
 (b) Let L ∈ M(VLC   , X(L))∗laur be a Laurent functional supported at S. For
     every ϕ ∈ M(VC , H, E) the function L∗ ϕ: L \ ∪HL (S) → E defined by

                               L∗ ϕ(w): = L(ϕ(w + · ))                    (11.7)

     belongs to M(L, HL (S), E). Finally, L∗ is a continuous linear map from
     M(VC , H, E) to M(L, HL (S), E). In fact, for every d ∈ NH there exists
     a d′ ∈ NHL (S) , independent of E, such that L∗ maps M(VC , H, d, E)
     continuously into M(L, HL (S), d′ , E).

Proof: It suffices to prove the result for S consisting of a single point a.
Applying a translation by −a if necessary, we may as well assume that a = 0.
Then HL (S) = HL (0) = HL . Let H′ be the union of H with H(L, X). Then
M(VC , H, E) ⊂ M(VC , H′ , E) and (H′ )L = HL = HL (S), hence assertions (a)
and (b) of Lemma 11.4 with H′ in place of H imply assertion (a) and (b), except
for the final statement about the continuity.
    For the final statement of (b), we note that by Lemma 11.4(b), L∗ is a
Laurent operator M(VC , H′ ) → M(L, HL (S)). Let d: H → N be a map. We
extend d to H′ by triviality on H′ \ H. Then according to Lemma 11.3 there
exists a map d′ : HL (S) → N such that for any complete locally convex space E
the map
                   L∗ : M(VC , H′ , d, E) → M(L, HL (S), d′ , E)
is continuous linear. Since d is zero on H′ \ H, the first of these spaces equals
M(VC , H, d, E) and the asserted continuity follows.                           


Lemma 11.7 Let L, H, S and L be as in Cor. 11.6, and fix w ∈ L \ ∪HL (S).
There exists a Laurent functional (in general not unique) L′ ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur ,
supported in w + S, such that L′ ϕ = L(ϕ(w + · )) for all ϕ ∈ M(VC , H).
Proof: As in the proof of Cor. 11.6 we may assume that S = {0}. Let
H̃ = H ∪ H(w, X). Then L∗ : ϕ 7→ L(ϕ(w + · )) is a Laurent operator in
Laur (VC , L, H̃), according to Lemma 11.4 (b). On the other hand, it follows
from Lemma 10.5 (see Remark 10.6) that there exists a (in general not unique)


                                       75
XL -Laurent functional L′′ on L such that ψ(w) = L′′ (ψw ) for each ψ ∈ Ow (L).
The functional ψ 7→ L′′ (ψw ) is defined for ψ ∈ M(L, H̃L ), and it may be viewed
as a Laurent operator in Laur (L, {w}, H̃L ), which we denote by the same sym-
bol L′′ (see [11] Appendix, Remark B.4). It now follows from [10], Lemma 1.8
that the composed map L′′ ◦ L∗ belongs to Laur (VC , {w}, H̃) and hence by [11]
Appendix, Remark B.4 it is given by an X-Laurent functional L′ , supported
at w. In particular, for ϕ ∈ M(VC , H) we have from Lemma 11.4 (b) that
w 7→ L(ϕ(w + · )) is holomorphic in a neighborhood of w, hence its evaluation
at w is obtained from the application of L′′ to it. Thus L(ϕ(w + · )) = L′ ϕ for
ϕ ∈ M(VC , H).                                                                 

   Recall from Section 10 that M(VC , X, E) is the union of the spaces M(VC , H, E)
with H an X-configuration.

                                           ⊥
Lemma 11.8 Let L ∈ A and let L ∈ M(VLC       , X(L))∗laur be a Laurent func-
tional. Then for any complete locally convex space E there exists a unique
linear operator
                     L∗ : M(VC , X, E) → M(L, XL , E)
that coincides on the subspace M(VC , H, E) with the operator L∗ defined in
Corollary 11.6, for every X-configuration H in VC .
Proof: Let H1 and H2 be two X-configurations. Let S = supp (L) and let, for
j = 1, 2, the continuous linear operator Lj∗ : M(VC , Hj , E) → M(L, HjL (S), E)
be defined as in Corollary 11.6 with Hj in place of H. Then it suffices to show
that L1∗ and L2∗ coincide on the intersection of M(VC , H1 , E) and M(VC , H2 , E).
That intersection equals M(VC , H1 ∩ H2 , E). Let ϕ be a function in the latter
space, then from the defining formula (11.7) it follows that L1∗ ϕ = L2∗ ϕ on the
intersection of the sets L \ ∪HjL (S), for j = 1, 2. This implies that L1∗ ϕ and
L2∗ ϕ coincide as elements of M(L).                                              

   We end this section with another useful consequence.

Lemma 11.9 Let L ∈ M(VLC     ⊥                                      e of V × V \
                               , X(L))∗laur . Let the finite subset X
                       e = (X × {0}) ∪ ({0} × X). If Φ ∈ M(VC × VC , X),
{(0, 0)} be defined by X                                                 e then

                      Ψ: (w1 , w2 ) 7→ L(Φ( · + w1 , · + w2 ))

defines a function in M(L × L, Xe L), where X
                                            eL = (XL × {c(L)})∪({c(L)} × XL).
In particular, the pull-back of Ψ under the diagonal embedding j: L → L × L
belongs to the space M(L, XL ).
Proof: Equip VL⊥ × VL⊥ with one half times the direct sum inner product.
Then the diagonal embedding ι: z 7→ (z, z) is an isometry of VL⊥ into VL⊥ × VL⊥ .
Its adjoint is the map p: (z1 , z2 ) 7→ 12 (z1 + z2 ) from VL⊥ × VL⊥ onto VL⊥ . The
              e
intersection X(L): = Xe ∩ (V ⊥ × V ⊥ ) equals (X(L) × {0}) ∪ ({0} × X(L)).
                               L       L
Its image under p is given by X(L)  e          1
                                         0 = 2 X(L). Thus, according to Lemma



                                        76
10.10, the space of X(L)   e                                  ⊥
                                 0 -Laurent functionals on VLC is equal to the space of
                                        ⊥
X(L)-Laurent functionals on VLC . Hence, according to Lemma 10.14 and the
remark following its proof, we have an associated push-forward map ι∗ from
       ⊥                                  ⊥ e
M(VLC    , X(L))∗laur to M(VLC      ⊥
                                      × VLC , X(L))∗laur .
     For generic w1 , w2 ∈ L we define the meromorphic function Φ(w1 ,w2 ) on VLC   ⊥
                                                                                      ×
   ⊥       (w1 ,w2 )
VLC by Φ             (z1 , z2 ) = Φ(w1 + z1 , w2 + z2 ). The definition of Ψ may now be
rewritten as Ψ(w1 , w2 ) = L[ι∗ (Φ(w1 ,w2 ) )]. By (10.6) it follows that Ψ(w1 , w2 ) =
ι∗ (L)(Φ(w1 ,w2 ) ), or, equivalently, in the notation of Lemma 11.8,

                                   Ψ = [ι∗ (L)]∗ Φ.

We now observe that X     eL = (X)
                                 e L×L . Hence it follows by application of Lemma
11.8. that Ψ ∈ M(L×L, X̃L ). There exists an X̃L -configuration H̃ in L×L such
that Ψ ∈ M(L × L, H̃). Any hyperplane H̃ ∈ H̃ is of the form H̃ = H × L or
H̃ = L × H, with H an XL -hyperplane in L. In both cases j −1 (H̃) = H. It now
follows that j −1 (H̃) is an XL -configuration in L, and that j ∗ Ψ ∈ M(L, XL ). 



12      Analytic families of a special type
                                       hyp
In this section we introduce a space EQ    (X+ : τ : δ) of analytic families of D(X)-
finite τ -spherical functions whose singular locus is a Σ-configuration. The defi-
nition of this space is motivated by the fact that it contains the families obtained
from applying Laurent functionals to Eisenstein integrals related to a minimal
σ-parabolic subgroup, as we shall see in the following sections, and by the fact
that the vanishing theorem is applicable, see Theorem 12.10.
    In this section we fix a choice Σ+ of positive roots for Σ and denote by P0
the associated minimal standard σ-parabolic subgroup.

Definition 12.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC be a finite subset. We define
                                    ep,hyp
                                   CQ,Y    (X+ : τ )                              (12.1)

to be the space of functions f : a∗QqC ×X+ → Vτ , meromorphic in the first variable,
for which there exist a constant k ∈ N, a Σr (Q)-hyperplane configuration H in
a∗QqC and a function d: H → N such that the following conditions are fulfilled.
 (a) The function λ 7→ fλ belongs to M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X+ : τ )).
 (b) For every P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ NK (aq ) there exist functions qs,ξ (P, v | f ) in
     Pk (aq ) ⊗ M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X0,v : τM )), for s ∈ W/WQ and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y +
     N∆(P ), with the following property. For all λ ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H, m ∈ X0,v and

Finally, we define

Remark 12.2 Note the analogy between the above definition and Definition
7.1. In fact, let Ω = a∗QqC \ ∪H, then it follows immediately from the definitions
                                                      ep
that the restriction of f to Ω × X+ belongs to CQ,Y       (X+ : τ : Ω). Moreover,
it follows from Lemma 7.3 that the functions qs,µ (P, v | f ) introduced above
are unique, and that the notation used here is consistent with the notation in
Definition 7.1. The precise relation between the definitions is given in Lemma
12.5 below.


Remark 12.3 In analogy with Remark 7.2 we note that the space (12.1) de-
pends on Q through its σ-split component AQq . Moreover, it suffices in the
above definition to require conditions (b) and (c) for a fixed P ∈ Pσmin and all
v in a given set W ⊂ NK (aq ) of representatives for W/WK∩H . Alternatively,
it suffices to require those conditions for a fixed given v ∈ NK (aq ) and each
P ∈ Pσmin .
    Finally, we note that aP0 q = aq , hence ∗ aP0 = {0}. Thus, if Q = P0 , we only
need to consider the finite set Y = {0}. This explains the limitation in (12.3).
   It follows from Remark 12.2 that the following definition of the notion of
asymptotic degree is in accordance with the definition of the similar notion in
Definition 7.1.

                               ep,hyp
Definition 12.4 Let f ∈ CQ,Y          (X+ : τ ). We define the asymptotic degree of
f, denoted dega (f ), to be the smallest integer k for which there exist H, d such
that the conditions of Definition 12.1 are fulfilled. Moreover, we denote by Hf
the smallest Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC such that the conditions of Definition
12.1 are fulfilled with k = dega (f ) and for some d: Hf → N. These choices being
fixed, we denote by df the -minimal map Hf → N for which the conditions of
the definition are fulfilled. Finally, we put rega (f ): = a∗QqC \ ∪Hf .
   If Q ∈ Pσ , we denote by Σr0 (Q) the set of indivisible roots in Σr (Q), i.e., the
roots α ∈ Σr (Q) with ]0, 1]α ∩ Σr (Q) = {α}. Moreover, we put Σ+    0 = Σr0 (P0 ).


                                          78
Let H be a Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC and d: H → N a map. If ω ⊂ a∗QqC is
a bounded subset, we define πω,d as in (11.1) with V = a∗Qq , X = Σr (Q) and
X 0 = Σr0 (Q).

Lemma 12.5 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset, H a Σr (Q)-configuration
in a∗QqC and d ∈ NH . Assume that f ∈ M(a∗QqC , C ∞ (X+ : τ )). Then the following
two conditions are equivalent.
                                  ep,hyp
 (a) The function f belongs to CQ,Y      (X+ : τ ) and satisfies Hf ⊂ H and df 
     d.
 (b) For every non-empty bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗QqC , the function fπω,d : (λ, x) 7→
                                                   ep
     πω,d (λ)f (λ, x), ω × X+ → Vτ belongs to CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : ω).
Moreover, if one of the above equivalent conditions is fulfilled, then for every
non-empty bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗qC and all P ∈ Pσmin , v ∈ NK (aq ),
s ∈ W/WQ and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ),

                       qs,ξ (P, v | fπω,d ) = πω,d qs,ξ (P, v | f ),          (12.4)

where on the right-hand side we have identified πω,d with the function 1⊗πω,d ⊗1
in P (aq ) ⊗ O(ω) ⊗ C ∞ (X0,v : τ ).
Proof: Assume that (a) holds and that ω ⊂ a∗QqC is a non-empty bounded open
subset. Put π = πω,d and fπ = fπω,d . It follows from Definition 12.1 (a) that
fπ : ω × X+ → Vτ is smooth and that fπλ is τ -spherical for every λ ∈ ω. Thus, it
remains to verify conditions (b) and (c) of Definition 7.1 for fπ . Let P ∈ Pσmin
and v ∈ NK (aq ). For s ∈ W/WQ and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ) we define
                ′
               qs,ξ (P, v | fπ , X, λ, m): = π(λ)qs,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ, m).
                                                                                   ′
Then conditions (b) and (c) of Definition 7.1, with k = dega f and with qs,ξ
in place of qs,ξ , follow from the similar conditions of Definition 12.1. Thus,
                         ep
it follows that fπ ∈ CQ,Y    (X+ : τ : ω) and that (12.4) holds for all P ∈ Pσmin ,
v ∈ NK (aq ), s ∈ W and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ).
    Now assume that (b) holds, then it suffices to show that (a) holds. Let ω be
a bounded non-empty open subset of a∗QqC . Then it follows from Definition 7.1
that the function fπ = fπω,d : ω × X+ → Vτ is smooth; moreover, from condition
(a) of the mentioned definition it follows that fπ,λ is τ -spherical for every λ ∈ ω.
Hence the map λ 7→ fπ belongs to O(ω, C ∞ (X+ : τ )). Since ω was arbitrary, this
implies that λ 7→ fλ belongs to M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X+ : τ )). Hence f satisfies
condition (a) of Definition 12.1. Let now P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ NK (aq ). Then it
remains to establish conditions (b) and (c) of that definition.
    If ω is a non-empty bounded open subset of a∗QqC , then obviously the restric-
                                                    ep
tion to ω \ ∪H of the function fπ belongs to CQ,Y        (X+ : τ : ω \ ∪H). Moreover,
since πω,d is nowhere zero on ω \ ∪H, it follows from division by πω,d that the
                                          ep
restriction f |(ω\∪H)×X+ belongs to CQ,Y       (X+ : τ : ω \ ∪H). Hence, in view of
                                             ep
Lemma 7.5, the function f belongs to CQ,Y (X+ : τ : Ω), where Ω: = a∗QqC \ ∪H.
Let k = dega f.

                                            79
  It follows from the division by πω,d , that for every s ∈ W and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y +
N∆(P ),

         πω,d (λ)qs,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ) = qs,ξ (P, v | fπ , · , λ),    (λ ∈ ω \ ∪H).

In particular, the function (X, λ) 7→ πω,d (λ)qs,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ) belongs to the
space Pk (aq ) ⊗ O(ω, C ∞ (X0,v : τM )). Since ω is arbitrary, this implies that f
satisfies condition (b) of Definition 12.1.
    From condition (c) of Definition 7.1 with fπ and ω in place of f and Ω,
respectively, it follows that, for s ∈ W, the series
                        X
                                   a−ξ πω,d (λ) qs,ξ (P, v | f, log a, λ)
                   ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )

converges neatly on A+ q (P ) as a ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series with coeffi-
cients in O(ω, C ∞ (X0,v : τ )). Since ω was arbitrary, it follows from the definition
of the topology on M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X0,v : τM )) (see Section 11) that f satisfies
condition (c) of Definition 12.1.                                                    

Remark 12.9 Combining Lemmas 12.5 and 9.4 we see that, in the above def-
            hyp
inition of EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ), it suffices to require that Iδ,λ annihilates fλ for λ in
a non-empty open subset of rega (f ).
    We now come to a special case of the vanishing theorem that will be partic-
ularly useful in the following. Let Q W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a complete set of represen-
tatives for WQ \W/WK∩H .

Theorem 12.10 (A special case of the vanishing theorem) Let Q ∈ Pσ and
                      hyp
let δ ∈ DQ . Let f ∈ EQ   (X+ : τ : δ)glob and let Ω′ be a non-empty open subset
of rega f. If
                            λ − ρQ ∈  / Exp(Q, u | fλ )
for each u ∈ Q W and all λ ∈ Ω′ , then f = 0.


                                             81
Proof: Put Ω = rega (f ). It follows immediately from the definitions that the
restriction fΩ of f to Ω is a family in EQ (X+ : τ : Ω : δ)glob . Moreover, being the
complement of a locally finite collection of hyperplanes, Ω is Q-distinguished in
a∗QqC . It follows that fΩ satisfies all hypothesis of Theorem 9.10; hence fΩ = 0
and hence f = 0.                                                                   



13      Action of Laurent functionals on analytic fam-

Let Q ∈ Pσ be fixed. We shall discuss the application of a Laurent functional
L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur , to families f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ). More precisely, we want
to set up natural conditions on f under which the family obtained from applying
                       hyp
L to f belongs to EQ       (X+ : τ : δ)glob , so that Theorem 12.10 is applicable.
    Given a Σ-configuration H in a∗qC and a finite subset S ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC we define
the Σr (Q)-configuration HQ (S) = Ha∗QqC (S) as in (11.6), with V = a∗qC , X = Σ,
and L = a∗QqC . Thus, for ν ∈ a∗QqC we have

      / ∪HQ (S) ⇐⇒ [ ∀λ ∈ S ∀H ∈ H: λ + ν ∈ H ⇒ λ + a∗QqC ⊂ H ].

We recall from Lemma 11.8 that a Laurent functional L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur
induces a linear operator

                     L∗ : M(a∗qC , Σ, U ) → M(a∗QqC , Σr (Q), U ),              (13.1)

for any complete locally convex space U.

Lemma 13.1 Let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur and put Y = supp L. Let H be a Σ-
configuration in a∗qC , and let H′ = HQ (Y ). Then for every map d: H → N there
exists a map d′ : H′ → N such that, for every complete locally convex space U,
the linear map (13.1) restricts to a continuous linear operator

                    L∗ : M(a∗qC , H, d, U ) → M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , U ),

Proof: This follows immediately from Corollary 11.6.                                

    For the formulation of the next result it will be convenient to introduce a
particular linear map. Let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur and let λ0 ∈ Y : = supp L.
Let Lλ0 ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur be the Laurent functional supported at λ0 , defined
as in Remark 10.9, and let U be a complete locally convex space. If P ∈ Pσ
and s ∈ WP \W, then we define the linear operator LP,s               ∗
                                                       λ0 ∗ from M(aqC , Σ, U ) into
C(aP q , M(a∗QqC , Σr (Q), U )) by the formula

                LP,s
                 λ0 ∗ ϕ(X, ν) = e
                                  −s(λ0 +ν)(X)

for ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H, U ), X ∈ aP q and ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪HQ (Y ).

   If f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ), then f, viewed as the function λ 7→ fλ , belongs to
the complete locally convex space M(a∗qC , Hf , df , C ∞ (X+ : τ )). Accordingly,

                        L∗ f ∈ M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , C ∞ (X+ : τ )),                (13.3)

where H′ = Hf Q (Y ) and d′ : H′ → N is associated with L, Hf and df as in

      for all X ∈ aP q and ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H′ . In particular,

           Exp(P, v | (L∗ f )ν )
             ⊂ {s(ν + λ)|aP q − ρP − µ | s ∈ W, λ ∈ Y, µ ∈ N∆r (P ), qs,µ (P, v | f ) 6= 0}.



Remark 13.3 Note that the index set of the inner sum in (13.5) may be empty.
We agree that such a sum should be interpreted as zero.
   The following lemma prepares for the proof of the proposition.

Lemma 13.4 Let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur be a Laurent functional with support
contained in the finite set Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC . Let H be a Σ-configuration in a∗qC and
d: H → N a map. Let H′ = HQ (Y ) and d′ : H′ → N be as in Lemma 13.1. There
exists a natural number k ′ ∈ N with the following property.
    For every λ0 ∈ Y, every P ∈ Pσ , each s ∈ WP \W and any complete locally
convex space U, the operator LP,s
                                λ0 ∗ restricts to a continuous linear map

            LP,s       ∗                                 ∗      ′ ′
             λ0 ∗ : M(aqC , H, d, U ) → Pk′ (aP q ) ⊗ M(aQqC , H , d , U ).


Proof: For a fixed X ∈ aP q , multiplication by the holomorphic function
es( · )(X) : a∗qC → C yields a continuous linear endomorphism of the space M(a∗qC , H, d, U );

                                             83
similarly, multiplication by the holomorphic function e−s(λ0 + · )(X) : a∗QqC → C
yields a continuous linear endomorphism of M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , U ). It now follows
from (13.2) that for a fixed X ∈ aP q , the function LP,s    λ0 ∗ ϕ(X) belongs to the
space M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , U ) and depends continuously on ϕ. Thus, it remains to
establish the polynomial dependence on X.
    For any Σ-hyperplane H ⊂ a∗qC we denote by αH the root from Σ+                0 such
                                          +               +                  +
that H is a translate of α⊥    HC . Let Σ Q,0 : = Σ Q ∩ Σ 0 and   let d0 : Σ Q,0 →  N be
                             ⊥                               ⊥
defined by d0 (α) = d(α + λ0 ); thus d0 (α) = 0 if α + λ0 ∈            / H. We define
π0 = πλ0 ,d0 as in (10.1) with ∗ a∗Qq , λ0 , Σ+ Q,0 and d0 in place of V, a, X and d,
respectively. If ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H, d, U ), then for ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H′ , the germ of the
function ϕν : λ 7→ ϕ(λ + ν) at λ0 belongs to π0−1 Oλ0 (∗ a∗QqC , U ). Hence there
exists a constant coefficient differential operator u0 ∈ S(∗ a∗Qq ), independent of
U, such that

         Lλ0 ∗ ϕ(ν) = u0 [π0 ( · )ϕ( · + ν)](λ0 ),       (ν ∈ a∗Qq \ ∪H′ ),            (13.6)

for any ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H, d, U ). Inserting (13.6) in (13.2) we find that

        LP,s
         λ0 ∗ ϕ(X, ν) =       e−s(λ0 +ν)(X) u0 [es( · +ν)(X) π0 ( · )ϕ( · + ν)](λ0 )
                         =    e−s(λ0 )(X) u0 [es( · )(X) π0 ( · )ϕ( · + ν)](λ0 ).

By application of the Leibniz rule it finally follows that this expression is poly-
nomial in the variable X of degree at most k ′ : = order(u0 ).                   

Proof of Proposition 13.2: By linearity we may assume that supp L consists
of a single point λ0 ∈ ∗ a∗QqC . Let H = Hf and d = df , and let d′ : H′ → N and
k ′ ∈ N be associated as in Lemmas 13.1 and 13.4. We will establish parts (a),
(b) and (c) of Definition 12.1 for L∗ f with k, H and d replaced by k + k ′ , H′
and d′ . Note that part (a) was observed already in (13.3). Put Ω: = a∗QqC \ ∪H′ .
Then, in particular, the function L∗ f : Ω × X+ → Vτ is smooth.
     We will establish parts (b) and (c) of Definition 12.1 by obtaining an expo-
nential polynomial expansion for (L∗ f )ν , for ν ∈ Ω, along P ∈ Pσmin. However,
having the proof of (13.5) in mind, we assume only P ∈ Pσ at present. Let
v ∈ NK (aq ). Then f ∈ CPep0 ,{0} (X+ : τ : a∗qC \ ∪H) by Remark 12.2. Hence by
Lemma 12.7 and (7.13) we obtain, for λ ∈ a∗qC \ ∪H,
                    X
  f (λ, mav) =             fs (λ, a, m),       (m ∈ XP,v,+ , a ∈ A+
                                                                  P q (RP,v (m)
                                                                               −1
                                                                                  )),
                 s∈WP \W
                                                                                       (13.7)

where the functions fs on the right-hand side are defined by
                               X
       fs (λ, a, m) = asλ−ρP         a−µ qs,µ (P, v | f )(log a, λ, m).                (13.8)
                                µ∈N∆r (P )




                                             84
Here the functions qs,µ (P, v | f ) belong to the space Pk (aP q )⊗M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )).
By Lemma 12.7 (b), for every R > 1 the series in (13.8) converges neatly on
A+P q (R
         −1
            ) as a series with coefficients in M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )). By
(13.2) we have, for ν ∈ Ω, m ∈ XP,v,+ [R] and a ∈ A+      P q (R
                                                                 −1
                                                                    )
                                              X
L∗ (fs )(ν, a, m) = as(λ0 +ν)−ρP LP,s
                                  λ0 ∗ [                a−µ qs,µ (P, v | f )(log a, · , m)](log a, ν).
                                           µ∈N∆r (P )


It follows from Lemma 13.4 that LP,s λ0 ∗ may be applied term by term to the series.
Moreover, the resulting series is neatly convergent on A+       P q (R
                                                                       −1
                                                                          ) as a ∆r (P )-
                                                          ∗
exponential polynomial series with coefficients in M(aQqC , H , d , C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )).
                                                                   ′ ′

    The application of L∗ thus leads to the following identity,
                                       X
    L∗ (fs )(ν, a, m) = as(λ0 +ν)−ρP         a−µ qs,µ
                                                  L
                                                      (P, v | f )(log a, ν, m), (13.9)
                                       µ∈N∆r (P )

                    L
where the function qs,µ (P, v | f ): aP q × Ω → C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ) is given by

        L
       qs,µ (P, v | f )(log a, ν) = LP,s
                                     λ0 ∗ [qs,µ (P, v | f, log a, · )](log a, ν).         (13.10)

Using Lemma 13.4 we deduce that
          L
         qs,µ (P, v | f ) ∈ Pk+k′ (aP q ) ⊗ M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )).

    Combining (13.9) with (13.7) we obtain an exponential polynomial expansion
along (P, v) for the τ -spherical function (L∗ f )ν as
                       X                    X
   (L∗ f )ν (mav) =          as(λ0 +ν)−ρP           a−µ qs,µ
                                                         L
                                                             (P, v | f )(log a, ν, m).
                      s∈WP \W                   µ∈N∆r (P )
                                                                                          (13.11)

If s ∈ WP \W and ν ∈ a∗QqC , then sν|aP q = [s]ν|aP q , where [s] denotes the class
of s in W/ ∼P |Q . It follows that the series in (13.11) may be rewritten as
              X                      X
                      aσν−ρP                    asλ0 −µ qs,µ
                                                         L
                                                             (P, v | f )(log a, ν, m).

                                  µ∈N∆r (P )



The exponents sλ0 − µ as s ∈ WP \W, [s] = σ and µ ∈ N∆r (P ), are all of
the form −ξ, with ξ ∈ −σ · {λ0 } + N∆r (P ). Thus, we see that, for ν ∈ Ω,
m ∈ XP,v,+ [R] and a ∈ A+
                        P q (R
                               −1

From what we said earlier about the convergence of the series in (13.9), it follows
that, for every R > 1, the inner series on the right-hand side of (13.12) converges
neatly on A+ P q (R
                    −1
                       ) as a ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial series with coefficients
in the space M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )).
    If P is minimal, then XP,v,+ [R] = X0,v and we see that L∗ f satisfies condi-
tions (b) and (c) of Definition 12.1 with qσ,ξ (P, v | L∗ f ) = q̃σ,ξ for σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q
= W/WQ . This establishes part (a) of the proposition.
    For general P we now see that the functions q̃σ,ξ introduced above coincide
with functions qσ,ξ (P, v | L∗ f ) introduced in Theorem 7.7. Finally, combining
(13.13) and (13.10) we see that we have established part (b) of the proposition
as well.                                                                             


Lemma 13.5 Let δ ∈ DP0 and f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : δ). Let Q ∈ Pσ and L ∈
M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur , and put Y = supp L. There exists a δ ′ ∈ DQ such that
                                             hyp
                                     L∗ f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ ′ ).

Proof: It follows from Proposition 13.2 that L∗ f ∈ CQ,Y          (X+ : τ ). Moreover,
rega L∗ f ⊃ Ω = a∗QqC \ Hf Q (Y ). Then in view of Definition 12.8 and Remark
12.9 it suffices to establish the existence of a δ ′ ∈ DQ such that, for every ν ∈ Ω,
the function (L∗ f )ν is annihilated by the cofinite ideal Iδ′ ,ν .
   By linearity we may assume that supp L consists of a single point λ0 ∈ ∗ a∗QqC .
Then L = Lλ0 .
   Let π0 , u0 be as in the proof of Lemma 13.4. Then from (13.6) we see that

                         (L∗ f )ν (x) = u0 [π0 ( · )f ( · + ν, x)](λ0 ),

for x ∈ X+ , ν ∈ Ω. Moreover, since (λ, x) 7→ π0 (λ)fλ+ν (x) is smooth in a
neighborhood of {λ0 } × X+ , it follows that, for D ∈ D(X), ν ∈ Ω and x ∈ X+ ,

                        D(L∗ f )ν (x) = u0 [π0 ( · )D(f · +ν )(x)](λ0 ).             (13.14)

Put l = order(u0 ) and define δ ′ ∈ DQ by supp δ ′ = {λ0 } + supp δ and δ ′ (λ0 +
Λ) = δ(Λ) + l for Λ ∈ supp δ. It suffices to prove the following. Let elements
DiΛ ∈ D(X) be given for i = 1, . . . , δ(Λ) + l, for each Λ ∈ supp δ, and define the
differential operator
                              δ(Λ)+l

         Dν : =                        (DiΛ − γ(DiΛ , λ0 + Λ + ν)) ∈ D(X)            (13.15)

for ν ∈ a∗QqC . Then Dν annihilates (L∗ f )ν for each ν ∈ Ω.
    It follows from (13.4) and (13.14) that

                    Dν (L∗ f )ν (x) = u0 [π0 ( · )Dν f · +ν (x)](λ0 ),        (13.16)

where the dots indicate a variable in ∗ a∗QqC . We write each factor in Dν as

      DiΛ − γ(DiΛ , λ0 + Λ + ν)
          = [DiΛ − γ(DiΛ , · + Λ + ν)] + [γ(DiΛ , · + Λ + ν) − γ(DiΛ , λ0 + Λ + ν)],

also with variables in ∗ a∗QqC indicated by dots. Inserting this into (13.15) and
(13.16) we obtain an expression for Dν (L∗ f )ν (x) as a sum of terms each of the

                          i∈SΛ

with SΛ a subset of {1, . . . , δ(Λ) + l} and SΛc its complement in this set. On
the one hand, if SΛ has fewer than δ(Λ) elements for some Λ, there are at least
l + 1 factors in the corresponding product pΛ . Since each of these factors vanish
at λ0 , it follows from the Leibniz rule that then (13.17) vanishes. On the other
hand, if for
           Q each Λ the set SΛ has at least δ(Λ) elements, then the differential
operator Λ DΛ (λ) annihilates fλ+ν , again causing (13.17) to vanish. It follows
that Dν (L∗ f )ν (x) = 0.                                                       

    In the following definition we introduce a notion of asymptotic globality that
is somewhat stronger than the one in Definition 8.4. It is motivated by the fact
that it carries over by the application of Laurent functionals, as we shall see in
Proposition 13.9

Definition 13.6 Let Q ∈ Pσ , and let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC be finite. Let P ∈ Pσ ,
v ∈ NK (aq ) and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q .
                                                                   ep
 (a) Let Ω ⊂ a∗QqC be an open subset. A family f ∈ CQ,Y               (X+ : τ : Ω) is
     called holomorphically σ-global along (P, v) if there exists a full open
     subset Ω∗ of a∗QqC such that, for every ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ), the function
     λ 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, · )(λ) is a holomorphic Pk (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )-valued
     function on Ω∗ ∩ Ω, for some k ∈ N.
                          ep,hyp
 (b) A family f ∈ CQ,Y           (X+ : τ ) is called holomorphically σ-global along
     (P, v) if its restriction to Ω = rega f is holomorphically σ-global along
     (P, v), according to (a).

                                               87
    It is easily seen that the property of holomorphic globality according to (a)
of the above definition implies the globality in Definition 8.4. We have the
following analogue of Lemma 8.7, describing how the property of holomorphic
globality transforms under the action of NK (aq ).

                                                                 ep,hyp
Lemma 13.7 Let Q, Y , P , v and σ be as above, and let f ∈ CQ,Y         (X+ : τ ).
   If f is holomorphically σ-global along (P, v), then f is holomorphically uσ-
global along (uP u−1 , uv), for every u ∈ NK (aq ).
Proof: The proof is completely analogous to the proof of Lemma 8.7, involving
an application of Lemma 7.10.                                              


Proposition 13.8 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset and let P ∈ Pσ ,
                                                   ep,hyp
v ∈ NK (aq ) and σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q . Let f ∈ CQ,Y              (X+ : τ ) and put H = Hf ,
d = df and k = dega f .
   The family f is holomorphically σ-global along (P, v) if and only if, for every
element ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ), the function λ 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, · )(λ) belongs to
the space M(a∗QqC , H, d, Pk (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )).
Proof: The ‘if’-statement is obvious. Assume that f is holomorphically σ-
global along (P, v), and let ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ). According to Lemma 12.7,
the function
                               λ 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, · , λ)                   (13.18)
belongs to the space
                   M(a∗QqC , H, d, Pk (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )).         (13.19)
    Let Ω = rega (f ) and let Ω∗ be a full open subset of a∗QqC satisfying the
properties of Definition 13.6 (a) for the restriction of f to Ω. Then the function
(13.18) not only belongs to the space (13.19), but also to the space O(Ω∗ ∩
Ω, Pl (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )), for some l ∈ N. In particular we see that this is
true with l = k.
    Let now X ∈ aP q be fixed. Then it suffices to show that the function (13.18),
with X substituted for the dot, belongs to the space M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (XP,v : τP )).
To prove the latter, we fix an arbitrary bounded non-empty open set ω ⊂ a∗QqC
and put π: = πω,d , see above Lemma 12.5. Then the function F : ω×XP,v,+ → Vτ ,
defined by
                        F (λ, m) = π(λ) qσ,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ)(m)
is C ∞ and holomorphic in its first variable. Moreover, let ω0 be the full open
subset ω ∩ Ω∗ ∩ Ω of ω. Then by what we said above, the restricted function
F |ω0 ×XP,v,+ admits a smooth extension to the manifold ω0 ×XP,v . It now follows
from Corollary 18.2 that F has a unique smooth extension to ω × XP,v ; this
extension is holomorphic in the first variable. It follows that the function λ 7→
π(λ)qσ,ξ (P, v | f, X, λ) belongs to O(ω, C ∞ (XP,v : τP )). Since ω was arbitrary,
this completes the proof.                                                        

Proposition 13.9 Let f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ), let Q ∈ Pσ and let L be a Laurent
functional in M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur . Put Y = supp L. Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ) and
σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q .
    If f is holomorphically s-global along (P, v) for every s ∈ WP \W with [s] =
                 ep,hyp
σ, then L∗ f ∈ CQ,Y     (X+ : τ ) is holomorphically σ-global along (P, v).
                                                         ep,hyp
Proof: It follows from Proposition 13.2 (a) that L∗ f ∈ CQ,Y    (X+ : τ ). Assume
that f satisfies the globality assumptions. Then it remains to establish the
assertion on σ-globality for L∗ f .
    Let k = dega f. Let H = Hf , d = df and H′ = HQ (Y ). Moreover, let
d : H′ → N be associated with these data as in Lemma 13.1 and let k ′ ∈ N be
 ′

associated as in Proposition 13.2 (a). According to the latter proposition, the
set Ω′ = a∗QqC \ ∪H′ is contained in rega (L∗ f ).
    Let ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ). Moreover, let s ∈ WP \W be such that [s] = σ
and let λ0 ∈ Y be such that η: = sλ0 |aP q + ξ belongs to N∆r (P ). Then by
Proposition 13.8, the function

                                λ 7→ qs,η (P, v | f, · , λ)

belongs to M(a∗QqC , H, d, Pk (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )). Using Lemma 13.4 with
C ∞ (XP,v : τP ) in place of U, we see that, for X ∈ aP q , the function

                           ϕX : = LP,s
                                   λ0 ∗ [qs,η (P, v | f, X, · )]

belongs to M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , Pk′ (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )). Moreover, it depends on
X ∈ aP q as a polynomial function of degree at most k. It follows that the
function (ν, X) 7→ ϕX (ν)(X) belongs to the space

                  M(a∗QqC , H′ , d′ , Pk+k′ (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v : τP )).       (13.20)

Each term in the finite sum (13.5) is of this form. Hence the function

                           (ν, X) 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | L∗ f, X, ν)

belongs to the space (13.20) as well. This holds for all ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ).
Therefore the restriction of L∗ f to rega (L∗ f ) satisfies Definition 13.6 (a) with
Ω∗ = Ω′ .                                                                         

   The following definition is an analogue of the final part of Definition 12.8,
replacing the globality condition by a condition of holomorphic globality.

Definition 13.10 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let δ ∈ DQ . We define
                                  hyp
                                 EQ   (X+ : τ : δ)hglob

                                  hyp
to be the space of functions f ∈ EQ   (X+ : τ : δ) satisfying the following condi-
tion.


                                            89
     For each s ∈ W and every P ∈ Pσ1 with s(aQq ) 6⊂ aP q , the family f is
     holomorphically [s]-global along (P, v), for all v ∈ NK (aq ); here [s] denotes
     the image of s in W/∼P |Q = WP \W/WQ .
If Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC is a finite subset, we define
           hyp                      hyp                 hyp
          EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ)hglob = EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ) ∩ EQ   (X+ : τ : δ)hglob .

                           hyp                      hyp
   It is easily seen that EQ   (X+ : τ : δ)hglob ⊂ EQ   (X+ : τ : δ)glob . As in
Lemma 9.7 the above condition allows a reduction to a smaller set of (s, P ).

                                                                      hyp
Lemma 13.11 Let Q ∈ Pσ be standard, let δ ∈ DQ and f ∈ EQ                 (X+ : τ : δ).
                     hyp
Then f belongs to EQ     (X+ : τ : δ)hglob if and only if the following condition is
fulfilled.
     For each s ∈ W and every α ∈ ∆ with s−1 α|aQq 6= 0, the family f is
     holomorphically [s]-global along (Pα , v), for all v ∈ NK (aq ).

Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 9.7, involving Lemma 13.7
instead of Lemma 8.7.                                                    

   We now come to the main result of this section, which provides a source of
functions to which the vanishing theorem (Theorem 12.10) can be applied.

Theorem 13.12 Let δ ∈ DP0 and f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : δ)hglob , let Q ∈ Pσ be a
standard σ-parabolic subgroup and let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur . Put Y = supp L.
Then there exists a δ ′ ∈ DQ such that
                                    hyp
                            L∗ f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ ′ )hglob .

                                                                    hyp
Proof: From Lemma 13.5 it follows that L∗ f is a family in EQ,Y         (X+ : τ : δ ′ )
             ′                                                  −1
for some δ ∈ DQ . Let s ∈ W and α ∈ ∆ be such that s α|aQq 6= 0. Then
every t ∈ Wα sWQ also satisfies the condition t−1 α|aQq 6= 0; hence t(aQq ) 6⊂ aαq .
Thus, from the hypothesis it follows that f is holomorphically Wα t-global along
(Pα , v) for every t in the double coset Wα sWQ . According to Lemma 6.5, see also
Remark 9.6, the latter set equals the class [s] of s for the equivalence relation
∼Pα |Q in W. It now follows from Proposition 13.9 that L∗ f is holomorphically
[s]-global along (Pα , v). We conclude that L∗ f satisfies the conditions of Lemma
                             hyp
13.11, hence belongs to EQ,Y     (X+ : τ : δ ′ )hglob .                            



14      Partial Eisenstein integrals
In this section we will define partial Eisenstein integrals and show that they
belong to the families of eigenfunctions introduced in the previous section.

                                           90
    We start by recalling some properties of Eisenstein integrals. Let P ∈ Pσmin
be a minimal σ-parabolic subgroup. Let (τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional unitary
representation of K. Let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a fixed set of representatives for
W/WK∩H . Following [9], eq. (5.1), we define the complex linear space ◦ C = ◦ C(τ )
as the following formal direct sum of finite dimensional linear spaces
                          ◦
                              C: = ⊕w∈W C ∞ (X0,w : τM ).                     (14.1)

Every summand in the above sum, as w ∈ W, is a finite dimensional sub-
space of the Hilbert space L2 (X0,w , Vτ ); here the L2 -inner product is defined
relative to the normalized M -invariant measure of the compact space X0,w =
M/M ∩ wHw−1 and the Hilbert structure of Vτ . Thus, every summand is a
finite dimensional Hilbert space of its own right. The formal direct sum ◦ C is
equipped with the direct sum inner product, turning (14.1) into an orthogonal
direct sum.
    For ψ ∈ ◦ C, λ ∈ a∗qC and x ∈ X, the Eisenstein integral E(ψ : λ : x) =
E(P : ψ : λ : x) and its normalized version E ◦ (ψ : λ : x) = E ◦ (P : ψ : λ : x) are
defined as in [9], § 5. The Eisenstein integrals are τ -spherical functions of x, de-
pend meromorphically on λ and linearly on ψ. We view E ◦ (λ : x): = E ◦ ( · : λ : x)
(and similarly its unnormalized version) as an element of Hom(◦ C, Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗
◦ ∗
  C . Thus, for generic λ ∈ a∗qC , E ◦ (λ) is a τ ⊗ 1-spherical function on X. The
connection between the unnormalized and the normalized Eisenstein integral is
now given by the identity

                 E ◦ (λ : x) = E(λ : x) ◦ C(1 : λ)−1 ,      (x ∈ X),          (14.2)

for generic λ ∈ a∗qC . Here C(1 : λ): = CP |P (1 : λ) is a meromorphic End(◦ C)-
valued function of λ ∈ a∗qC ; see [9], p. 283.
    The Eisenstein integral is D(X)-finite. In fact, we recall from [9], eq. (5.11),
that there exists a homomorphism µ from D(X) to the algebra of End(◦ C)-valued
polynomial functions on a∗qC such that

               DE ◦ (λ) = [I ⊗ µ(D : λ)∗ ]E ◦ (λ),       (D ∈ D(X)).

It now follows from Lemma 5.3 that, for generic λ ∈ a∗qC , the Eisenstein integral
E ◦ (λ) belongs to C ep (X+ : τ ⊗ 1). It therefore has expansions of the form (2.12).
These expansions have been determined explicitly in [8]. We recall some of the
results of that paper.
     In [8], eq. (15), we define a function ΦP (λ : · ) on A+q (P ) by an exponential
polynomial series with coefficients in End(VτM∩K∩H ) of the form
                                 X
           ΦP (λ : a) = aλ−ρP          a−ν ΓP,ν (λ),     (a ∈ A+q (P )).       (14.3)
                               ν∈∆(P )


Note that here P replaces the Q of [8], Sect. 5; also, in [8] we suppressed
the Q in the notation. The coefficients in the expansion (14.3) are defined by
recursive relations (see [8], eq. (18) and Prop. 5.2); it follows from these that


                                         91
the coefficients depend meromorphically on λ, and that the expansion (14.3)
converges to a smooth function on A+ q (P ), depending meromorphically on λ. In
fact, we have the following stronger result.
    Let ΠΣ,R be the collection of polynomial functions a∗qC → C that can be
written as finite products of linear factors of the form λ 7→ hλ , αi − c, with
α ∈ Σ and c ∈ R. For R ∈ R, we define the set

               a∗q (P, R): = {λ ∈ a∗qC | Re hλ , αi < R ∀α ∈ Σ(P )}.


Lemma 14.1 Let R ∈ R. Then there exists a polynomial function p ∈ ΠΣ,R
such that the functions pΓP,ν , for ν ∈ N∆(P ), are all regular on aq (P, R).
Moreover, if p is a polynomial function with the above property, then the series
                              X
                                    a−ν p( · )ΓP,ν ( · )                 (14.4)
                              ν∈N∆(P )


converges neatly on A+                                                           ∗
                         q (P ) as an exponential series with coefficients in O(aq (P, R))⊗
         M∩K∩H
End(Vτ            ). In particular, the function (a, λ) 7→ p(λ)ΦP (λ : a) is smooth on
A+q (P ) × a ∗
             q (P, R), and in addition holomorphic in its second variable.
Proof: Let pR be the polynomial function described in [8], Thm. 9.1. As in
the proof of that theorem, it follows from the estimates in [8], Thm. 7.4, that
the power series                   X
                     Ψ(λ : z) =          z −ν pR (λ)ΓP,ν (λ)
                                   ν∈N∆(P )

converges absolutely locally uniformly in the variables z ∈ D∆(P ) and λ ∈
a∗q (P, R). Here we have used the notation of Sect. 1 of the present paper. Since
pR (λ)ΦP (λ : a) = aλ−ρP Ψ(λ : z(a)), for a ∈ A+   q (P ), this implies all assertions
of the lemma with pR in place of p.
     This is not immediately good enough, since pR is a finite product of linear
factors of the form λ 7→ hλ , νi − c, with ν ∈ N∆(P ) and c ∈ R, see [8], the
equation preceding Lemma 7.3. To overcome this, we invoke [8], Prop. 9.4.
It follows from that result and its proof that there exists a p ∈ ΠΣ,R such that
pΓP,ν is regular on a∗q (P, R), for every ν ∈ N∆(P ). Let p be any polynomial with
this property, and let 8 p be the least common multiple of p and pR . Then all
assertions of the lemma hold with 8 p in place of p. Let q be the quotient of 8 p by p.
Denote the image of the linear endomorphism mq : ϕ 7→ qϕ of O(a∗q (P, R)) by F ,
and equip this space with the locally convex topology induced from O(a∗q (P, R)).
It follows from an easy application of the Cauchy integral formula that mq is
a topological linear isomorphism from O(a∗q (P, R)) onto F ; see also [9], Lemma
20.7. As said above, all assertions of the lemma hold with 8 p in place of p; on
the other hand, by the hypothesis the series (14.4) with 8 p in place of p has
coefficients in F . Applying the continuous linear map m−1      q to that series, we
infer that all assertions of the lemma are true with the polynomial q −1 8 p = p.

    Following [8], Sect. 11, we define the function ΦP,w : a∗qC ×A+
                                                                  q (P ) → End(Vτ

                                                                                         ),
for w ∈ W, by

             ΦP,w (λ : a) = τ (w) ◦ Φw−1 P w (w−1 λ : w−1 aw) ◦ τ (w)−1 .     (14.5)

Following [9], p. 283, we define normalized C-functions C ◦ (s : λ) = CP◦ |P (s : λ),
for s ∈ W, by

                         C ◦ (s : λ) = C(s : λ) ◦ C(1 : λ)−1 ;                (14.6)

these are End(◦ C)-valued meromorphic functions of λ ∈ a∗qC . From (14.2) and [8],
eq. (54), we now obtain the following description of the normalized Eisenstein
integral in terms of the functions ΦP,w . Let ψ ∈ ◦ C and w ∈ W. Then, for
a ∈ A+q (P ),
                                  X
                E ◦ (λ : aw)ψ =         ΦP,w (sλ : a)[C ◦ (s : λ)ψ]w (e),     (14.7)
                                  s∈W

as a meromorphic identity in λ ∈ a∗q .
    From (14.5) and (14.3) it follows that, for w ∈ W, the function ΦP,w is given
by the series
                                           X
                  ΦP,w (λ : a) = aλ−ρP           a−ν ΓP,w,ν (λ),           (14.8)
                                             ν∈N∆(P )

with coefficients

                ΓP,w,ν (λ) = τ (w) ◦ Γw−1 P w,w−1 ν (w−1 λ) ◦ τ (w)−1 .       (14.9)

We now have the following result on the convergence of the series (14.8).

Corollary 14.2 Let w ∈ W. Then there exists a locally finite real Σ-hyperplane
configuration H = Hw in a∗qC and a map d = dw : H → N, such that the func-
                                                   −1
tions ΓP,w,ν belong to M(a∗qC , H, d, End(VτKM ∩wHw )), for every ν ∈ N∆(P ).
Moreover, the series
                                 X
                                        a−ν ΓP,w,ν                     (14.10)
                                  ν∈N∆(P )


converges neatly on A+  q (P ) as an exponential polynomial series with coefficients
                                             −1
                    ∗
in the space M(aqC , H, d, End(VτKM ∩wHw )). In particular, the function λ 7→
                                                                      KM ∩wHw −1
ΦP,w (λ : · ) belongs to the space M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (A+
                                                        q (P ))⊗End(Vτ           )).
Proof: For w = 1 the assertion of the corollary follows immediately from
Lemma 14.1. For arbitrary w ∈ W it then follows by application of (14.9). 




                                             93
   For s ∈ W we define the so called partial Eisenstein integral E+,s (λ) =
E+,s (P : λ) as the τ ⊗ 1-spherical function X+ → Vτ ⊗ ◦ C ∗ determined by

                 E+,s (λ : aw)ψ = ΦP,w (sλ : a)[C ◦ (s : λ)ψ]w (e),          (14.11)

for ψ ∈ ◦ C, w ∈ W, a ∈ A+                          ∗
                           q (P ) and generic λ ∈ aqC (use the isomorphism (2.8)).
It follows from Corollary 14.2 that E+,s is a meromorphic C ∞ (X+ : τ ⊗1)-valued
function on a∗qC . By sphericality it follows from (14.7) and (14.11) that
                                  X
                      E ◦ (λ) =         E+,s (λ)    on      X+ .             (14.12)
                                  s∈W

It follows from the definitions and the isomorphism (2.9) that, for generic λ ∈
a∗qC , the function E+,s (λ)ψ belongs to C ep (X+ : τ ⊗1) for each ψ ∈ ◦ C. Moreover,

                   Exp(P, v | E+,s (λ)ψ) ⊂ sλ − ρP − N∆(P ),                 (14.13)

for every v ∈ W and hence also for every v ∈ NK (aq ). Thus, we see that (14.12)
is the splitting of Lemma 2.2 applied to the Eisenstein integral. We abbreviate
E+ (λ) = E+,1 (λ). Then from (14.11) and (14.6) we see that

                        E+ (λ)(aw)ψ = ΦP,w (λ : a)ψw (e),

for ψ ∈ ◦ C, w ∈ W, a ∈ A+                        ∗
                          q (P ) and generic λ ∈ aqC . Moreover, the following
                                        ∗
holds as a meromorphic identity in λ ∈ aqC

                        E+,s (λ : x) = E+ (sλ : x) C ◦ (s : λ).              (14.14)

    In the next lemma we will need the following notation. If Λ ∈ b∗kC , we denote
by ◦ C[Λ] the subspace of ◦ C consisting of elements ψ satisfying µ(D : λ)ψ =
γ(D : Λ + λ)ψ for all D ∈ D(X), λ ∈ a∗qC . We recall from [9], eq. (5.14), that ◦ C
is a finite direct sum
                                ◦
                                  C = ⊕Λ ◦ C[Λ],
where Λ ranges over a finite subset Lτ of b∗kC . For each Λ ∈ b∗kC , we denote by
E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ) the space E0hyp (X+ : τ : δ) (see Definition 12.8) where δ ∈ DP
is the characteristic function of {Λ}.

Lemma 14.3 Let P ∈ Pσmin, t ∈ W and ψ ∈ ◦ C[Λ], where Λ ∈ b∗kC . Define the
family f = f{t} : a∗qC × X+ → Vτ , by

                            f (λ, x) = E+,t (P : λ : x)ψ.

Then f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ) and dega f = 0.
Proof: According to Definition 12.8 and Remark 12.9, in order to prove that
f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ) we must establish that f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ) and that fλ is
annihilated by IΛ+λ for λ in a non-empty open subset of rega f .


                                            94
    We first assume that t = 1. Then f (λ, x) = E+ (λ : x)ψ. It follows immedi-
ately from [8] Cor. 9.3 and the hypothesis on ψ that fλ is annihilated by IΛ+λ
for generic λ ∈ a∗qC . We will now show that f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ). Let H be
the union of the hyperplane configurations Hw , w ∈ W, of Corollary 14.2, and
let d: H → N be defined by d = maxw∈W dw (see Remark 11.1). Then for ev-
ery complete locally convex space U, the spaces M(a∗qC , Hw , dw , U ) are included
in the space M(a∗qC , H, d, U ), with continuous inclusion maps. Hence for each
w ∈ W the series (14.10) converges as a ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series on
                                                              KM ∩wHw −1
A+                                            ∗
  q (P ), with coefficients in the space M(aqC , H, d, End(Vτ             )). More-
over, the function λ 7→ ΦP,w (λ : · ) is contained in M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (A+
                                                                           q (P )) ⊗
                −1
End(VτKM ∩wHw )).
    On the other hand, from (14.11) and (14.6) with s = 1, it follows that
                     ↓
                    TP,w (fλ )(a) = f (λ, aw) = ΦP,w (λ : a)ψw (e),               (14.15)

for all w ∈ W, a ∈ A+                           ∗
                               q (P ) and λ ∈ aqC \ ∪H. Hence the function λ 7→
   ↓                                                             KM ∩wHw −1
TP,w (fλ ) belongs to the space M(aqC , H, d, C ∞ (A+
                                           ∗
                                                       q (P ), Vτ           )). In view
of the isomorphism (2.8), it now follows that the function λ 7→ fλ belongs to
M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (X+ : τ )). This establishes condition (a) of Definition 12.1, with
Q = P0 and Y = {0}.
     The evaluation map ψ 7→ ψ(e) is a linear isomorphism from C ∞ (X0,w : τM )
                      −1
onto VτKM ∩wHw . Thus, for w ∈ W and ν ∈ N∆(P ) we may define a function
q̃1,ν (P, w | f ): a∗qC → C ∞ (X0,w : τM ) by

                        q̃1,ν (P, w | f, λ, e) = ΓP,w,ν (λ)ψw (e),                (14.16)
for λ ∈ a∗qC . Then q̃1,ν (P, w | f ) ∈ M(a∗q , H, d, C ∞ (X0,w : τM )). Moreover, from
what we said earlier about the convergence of the series (14.10), it follows that,
for w ∈ W, the series              X
                                        a−ν q̃1,ν (P, w | f )
                               ν∈N∆(P )

converges neatly as a ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series on A+          q (P ), with coef-
ficients in M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (X0,w : τM )).
    From (14.15), (14.8) and (14.16) it follows by sphericality that, for w ∈ W,
λ ∈ a∗qC \ ∪H, m ∈ X0,w and a ∈ A+     q (P ),
                                        X
               fλ (maw) = aλ−ρP                a−ν q̃1,ν (P, w | f )(λ, m),
                                      ν∈N∆(P )

This establishes assertions (b) and (c) of Definition 12.1 with a fixed P, arbitrary
v ∈ W, and, for ν ∈ N∆(P ), X ∈ aq ,
                               
                                 q̃1,ν (P, v | f ) for     s = 1;
          qs,ν (P, v | f, X) =
                                 0                 for     s ∈ W \ {1}.

In view of Remark 12.3 we have shown that f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ). Moreover,
dega f = 0. This completes the proof for t = 1.

                                            95
   Let now t ∈ W be arbitrary and let t̃ ∈ W0 (b) be such that t̃|aq = t; see the
text preceding Lemma 5.5. From (14.14) we see that
                              f (λ, x) = E+ (tλ : x)C ◦ (t : λ)ψ.                  (14.17)
It follows from [9], Lemma 20.6, that there exists a Σ-configuration H′ in a∗qC
and a map d′ : H′ → N, such that
                            C ◦ (t : · ) ∈ M(a∗qC , H′ , d′ , End(◦ C)).           (14.18)
From [9], eq. (5.13), it follows that C ◦ (t : λ) maps ◦ C[Λ] into ◦ C[t̃Λ]. Fix a basis
ψ1 , . . . , ψs for ◦ C[t̃Λ]. Then there exist unique functions cj ∈ M(a∗qC , H′ , d′ ) such
that
                                                 Xr
                                  C ◦ (t : λ)ψ =    cj (λ)ψj .                      (14.19)
                                                       j=1

For 1 ≤ j ≤ r we define the family          gj : a∗qC   × X+ → Vτ by
                                   gj (λ, x) = E+ (λ : x)ψj .                      (14.20)
Then by the first part of the proof, each gj belongs to E0hyp (X+ : τ : t̃Λ). More-
over, for every 1 ≤ j ≤ r, the family gj satisfies the conditions of Definition 12.1
with Q = P0 and Y = {0}, with H and d as in the first part of the proof, and
with k = 0.
    For 1 ≤ j ≤ r we define the family fj : a∗qC × X+ → Vτ by fj (λ, x) = gj (tλ, x).
Then we readily see that fj satisfies the conditions of Definition 12.1 with
t−1 H and d ◦ t in place of H and d, respectively, and with k = 0. Hence
fj ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ). Since It̃Λ+tλ = IΛ+λ we see that fj ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ).
Moreover, dega fj = 0.
    Combining (14.17) and (14.19) with (14.20) and the definition of fj , we find
that
                                        r
                                        X
                             f (λ, x) =   cj (λ)fj (λ, x).
                                                 j=1

Let H = t H ∪ H and define d : H′′ → N by d′′ (H) = d(tH) + d′ (H) (see
       ′′    −1         ′                   ′′

Remark 11.1). Then by linearity it readily follows that f satisfies all conditions
of Definition 12.1, with k = 0 and with H′′ and d′′ in place of H and d, respec-
tively. Hence f ∈ C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ) and dega f = 0. Moreover, for generic λ, fλ is
annihilated by IΛ+λ , and hence f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ).                          


Corollary 14.4 Let assumptions be as in Lemma 14.3 and let Q be a σ-
                                                                 hyp
parabolic subgroup. Let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur . Then L∗ f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ)
for Y = supp L and δ a suitable element in DQ . Moreover,
                   Exp(P, v | (L∗ f )ν ) ⊂ t(ν + Y ) − ρP − N∆(P )
for v ∈ NK (aq ) and ν ∈ rega L∗ f .
Proof: This follows immediately from Lemmas 14.3 and 13.5, and from (14.13)
combined with the final statement in Proposition 13.2 (b).               

                                                   96
Lemma 14.5 Let ψ ∈ ◦ C[Λ] where Λ ∈ b∗kC . Then the family f : a∗qC × X+ → Vτ ,
defined by
                       f (λ, x) = E ◦ (P0 : λ : x)ψ
belongs to E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ). Moreover, dega f = 0 and for all P ∈ Pσ , v ∈
NK (aq ) and every s ∈ WP \W, the family f is holomorphically s-global along
(P, v).
Proof: The function f equals the sum, for t ∈ W, of the functions f{t} defined in
Lemma 14.3, with P0 in place of P. Hence f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ) and dega f = 0.
Moreover, for each λ ∈ rega f , the function fλ is asymptotically global along
all pairs (P, v) by Proposition 8.8. Thus, it remains to prove the assertion on
holomorphic globality. In view of Lemma 13.7, it suffices to do this for arbitrary
P ∈ Pσ and the special value v = e.
    In the rest of this proof we shall use notation of the paper [7]. According
to [7], Lemma 14, there exists a locally finite collection H of Σ-hyperplanes
such that λ 7→ fλ is holomorphic on Ω0 : = a∗qC \ ∪H, with values in C ∞ (X : τ ).
According to the same mentioned lemma it follows that f ∈ E∗ (G/H, Vτ , Ω0 ).
According to [7], p. 562, Cor. 1, for generic λ ∈ a∗qC the function fλ has an
asymptotic expansion of the form
                      X
    fλ (x exp tX) ∼         pP,ν (fλ : s : λ)(x) e(sλ−ρP −ν)(tX) (t → ∞) (14.21)
                     s∈WP \W
                     ν∈N∆r (P )



for X ∈ aP q at every X0 ∈ a+  P q . Proposition 10 of [7] is valid with E∗ (G/H, Vτ , Ω0 )
in place of E∗ (G/H, Λ, Ω0 ), by the remarks in the beginning of [7], Sect. 12. In
particular, there exists a full open subset 88 a∗qC of a∗qC such that, for all s ∈ WP \W
and ν ∈ N∆r (P ), the coefficient pP,ν (fλ : s : λ) is holomorphic as a C ∞ (G, Vτ )-
valued function of λ on the full open set Ω0 ∩ 8 8 a∗qC .
    On the other hand, since f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ), and dega f = 0, the expansion
(12.2) holds, with k = 0 and Y = {0}, for all λ ∈ Ω: = rega f. Thus, if λ ∈
Ω ∩ a∗0
     qC (P, {0}) is generic, then it follows from comparing the expansions (14.21)
and (12.2), and using Lemma 6.2 and uniqueness of asymptotics (see the proof
of Lemma 1.7), that

                    qs,ν (P, e | f, X, λ)(m) = pP,ν (fλ : s : λ)(m),              (14.22)

for all s ∈ WP \W, ν ∈ N∆r (P ), X ∈ aP q and m ∈ MP,+ ; here we have written
MP,+ for the preimage of XP,e,+ in MP .
    By analytic continuation the equality (14.22) holds for all λ in the full,
hence connected, open subset Ω′ : = Ω ∩ Ω0 ∩ 88 a∗qC of a∗qC . In particular it follows
that λ 7→ qs,ν (P, e | f, λ) is holomorphic on Ω′ as a function with values in
P0 (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,e : τP ), for all s ∈ WP \W and ν ∈ N∆r (P ). This establishes
the assertion on holomorphic globality, see Definition 13.6.                         

Lemma 14.6 Let Λ ∈ b∗kC , ψ ∈ ◦ C[Λ], S ⊂ W and define fS : a∗qC × X+ → Vτ by

Then the family fS belongs to E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ). Moreover, let t ∈ W and α ∈ ∆,
and assume that either Wα t ⊂ S or Wα t ∩ S = ∅, where Wα = {1, sα }. Then the
family fS is holomorphically Wα t-global along (Pα , v), for every v ∈ NK (aq ).
Proof: The first assertion is an immediate consequence of Lemma 14.3 with
P0 in place of P.
   Let v ∈ NK (aq ). It follows from (14.13) and Theorem 3.5 that

                   Exp(Pα , v | f{s}λ ) ⊂ sλ|aαq − ρα − N∆r (Pα )

sλ|aαq −ρα −N∆r (Pα ) are mutually disjoint for different [s] = Wα s from Wα \W,
see Lemmas 6.2 and 6.5. Hence

                              q[t],ξ (Pα , v | f{s} ) = 0,                   (14.23)

for all s ∈ W \ Wα t and all ξ ∈ ∆r (Pα ).
    First assume that Wα t∩S = ∅. Then it follows from (14.23) that q[t],ξ (Pα , v |
fS ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ ∆r (Pα ). Hence fS is holomorphically [t]-global along (Pα , v).
    Next assume that Wα t ⊂ S. Let S c = W \ S. Then fS = fW − fS c , and it
follows from Lemma 14.5 and what was just proved, that fS is holomorphically
[t]-global along (Pα , v).                                                         

   If Q ∈ Pσ is standard, then we define the subset W Q of W by

                          W Q = {s ∈ W | s(∆Q ) ⊂ Σ+ }                       (14.24)

It is well known, see e.g. [16], Thm. 2.5.8, that the multiplication map W Q ×
WQ → W is bijective. Moreover, if s ∈ W Q and t ∈ WQ , then l(st) = l(s) + l(t);
here l: W → N denotes the length function relative to ∆. In particular this means
that W Q consists of the minimal length representatives in W of the cosets in
W/WQ .

Lemma 14.7 Let s ∈ W, α ∈ ∆ and assume that s−1 α|aQq 6= 0. Let t ∈ WQ .
Then s ∈ W Q t if and only if sα s ∈ W Q t.
Proof: The hypothesis s−1 α|aQq 6= 0 is also satisfied by the elements s1 = st−1
and s2 = sα st−1 . Hence we need only prove the implication s ∈ W Q ⇒ sα s ∈
W Q.
   Assume that s ∈ W Q . Then s(∆Q ) ⊂ Σ+ . From the hypothesis it follows that
 −1
s α∈ / ∆Q , hence α ∈/ s(∆Q ). Since α is simple, it follows that sα (s(∆Q )) ⊂ Σ+ .
               Q
Hence sα s ∈ W .                                                                 

Corollary 14.8 Let ψ ∈ ◦ C[Λ] where Λ ∈ b∗kC and let Q ∈ Pσ be a standard
parabolic subgroup. Fix t ∈ WQ , and let the family f : a∗qC × X+ → Vτ be defined
by                              X
                     f (λ, x) =      E+,st (P0 : λ : x)(ψ).
                                  s∈W Q

Then f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ)hglob . If L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur , then the family L∗ f
                       hyp
belongs to the space EQ,Y  (X+ : τ : δ)hglob , where Y = supp L, and where δ is a
suitable element of DQ .
Proof: Let S = W Q t. Then, f = fS , where we have used the notation of
Lemma 14.6. It follows from the mentioned lemma that f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ).
Moreover, let s ∈ W and α ∈ ∆ be such that s−1 α|aQq 6= 0. Then it follows
from Lemma 14.7 that either Wα s ⊂ S or Wα s ∩ S is empty. Hence it follows
from Lemma 14.6 that f is holomorphically Wα s-global along (Pα , v), for every
v ∈ NK (aq ). Thus f ∈ E0hyp (X+ : τ : Λ)hglob by Lemma 13.11. The remaining
assertion now follows from Theorem 13.12.                                    



15      Asymptotics of partial Eisenstein integrals
Let P ∈ Pσmin and let Q be a σ-parabolic subgroup containing P. For the
application of the asymptotic vanishing theorem, Theorem 9.10, in the next
section we need to determine the coefficient of the leading exponent in the
(Q, v)-expansion of the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : λ), for every v ∈ NK (aq ). To
formulate a result in this direction, we need some additional notation.
    Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and select a complete set of representatives WQ,v in NKQ (aq )
for WQ /WKQ ∩vHv−1 . We define ◦ C(Q, v) = ◦ C(Q, v, τ ) to be the analogue of the
space ◦ C for the data X1Q,v , τQ . Thus
                ◦
                    C(Q, v) = ⊕u∈WQ,v C ∞ (M/M ∩ uvH(uv)−1 : τ )               (15.1)

with an orthogonal direct sum. Note that ◦ C(Q, v) is also the analogue of ◦ C
for the data XQ,v , τQ .
     One readily checks that the map WQ,v → W/WK∩H given by u 7→ Ad(uv)|aq
is injective. Hence we may extend WQ,v v to a complete set W ⊂ NK (aq ) of
representatives for W/WK∩H . If w ∈ W, then w ∈ WQ,v v ⇐⇒ wv −1 ∈ KQ .
With such choices made we have a natural isometric embedding iQ,v : ◦ C(Q, v) ֒→
◦
  C, defined by
                                
                                  ψwv−1    if w ∈ WQ,v v,
                   (iQ,v ψ)w =                                            (15.2)
                                  0        otherwise.

The adjoint of the embedding iQ,v is denoted by prQ,v : ◦ C → ◦ C(Q, v). It is given
by the following formula, for ψ ∈ ◦ C,

                         (prQ,v ψ)u = ψuv ,     (u ∈ WQ,v ).                   (15.3)


                                          99
    The normalized Eisenstein integral associated with the data X1Q,v , τQ and
∗
 P : = P ∩ M1Q is denoted by E ◦ (X1Q,v : ∗ P : ν), for ν ∈ a∗qC . Similarly, the par-
tial Eisenstein integrals associated with these data are denoted by E+,s (X1Q,v : ∗ P : ν),
for s ∈ WQ and ν ∈ a∗qC . Note that all of these are (τQ ⊗ 1)-spherical smooth
functions on X1Q,v,+ with values in Hom(◦ C(Q, v), Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v)∗ .

Proposition 15.1 Let P ∈ Pσmin , Q ∈ Pσ and assume that Q ⊃ P. Let v ∈
NK (aq ), and choose WQ,v , W as above such that WQ,v ⊂ Wv −1 . Let ψ ∈ ◦ C
and let the family f : a∗qC × X → Vτ be defined by

                              f (λ, x) = E ◦ (P : λ : x)ψ.

Then, for λ ∈ a∗qC generic, and for all X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,

        qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, v | fλ , X, m) = E ◦ (X1Q,v : ∗ P : λ : m) prQ,v ψ.     (15.4)

Proof: We first assume that v = e. Then X1Q,v = X1Q,e = M1Q /M1Q ∩ H.
Moreover, the set WQ : = WQ,e is contained in W. From [7], p. 563, Thm. 4, it
follows that

            qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, e | fλ , X, m) = E ◦ (X1Q,e : ∗ P : λ : m) prQ ψ,

for generic λ ∈ a∗qC and all X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,e,+ . Here prQ is the natural
projection map from ◦ C onto ◦ CQ (τ ) = ⊕v∈WQ C ∞ (M/M ∩ vHv −1 : τM ), see [7],
pp. 544 and 547. Thus, prQ equals the map prQ,e defined above and it follows
that (15.4) holds with v = e. To establish the result for arbitrary v ∈ NK (aq ),
we first need a lemma.
    From Remark 3.1 we recall that Xv = X1G,v = G/vHv −1 . The set WG,v : =
Wv −1 is a complete set of representatives for W/WK∩vHv−1 . Accordingly, the
analogue ◦ C(G, v) = ◦ C(G, v, τ ) of the space ◦ C is given by (15.1) with G in
place of Q. The associated map iG,v : ◦ C(G, v) → ◦ C is now a bijective isometry;
moreover, its adjoint prG,v is its two-sided inverse.
    We recall from the end of Section 3 that right translation by v induces
a topological linear isomorphism Rv from C ∞ (X : τ ) onto C ∞ (Xv : τ ). In the
following lemma we will relate the right translate of E ◦ (P : λ) to the normalized
Eisenstein integral associated with Xv , Wv −1 and P.

Lemma 15.2 Let ψ ∈ ◦ C. Then, for generic λ ∈ a∗qC ,

                  Rv (E ◦ (X : P : λ)ψ) = E ◦ (Xv : P : λ)[prG,v ψ].           (15.5)

The formula remains valid if the normalized Eisenstein integrals are replaced by
their unnormalized versions.
Proof: We first prove the formula for the unnormalized Eisenstein integrals.
Let λ ∈ a∗qC be such that hRe λ+ρP , αi < 0 for all α ∈ Σ(P ). Define the function

                                          100
                                                           R
ψ̃(λ): G → Vτ as in [7], Eq. (19). Then E(P : λ : x)ψ = K τ (k) ψ̃(λ : k −1 x) dk.
                         R
Hence E(P : λ : xv)ψ = K τ (k)ψ̃G,v (λ : k −1 x) dk, where ψ̃G,v (λ : x) = ψ̃(λ : xv).
One now readily checks that ψ̃G,v (λ) is the analogue of ψ̃(λ), associated with
the data Xv , Wv −1 and with the element ψG,v : = prG,v ψ of ◦ C(G, v). From this
we obtain the equality (15.5) for the present λ. For general λ, the result follows
by meromorphic continuation.
    Let Q ∈ Pσmin . Then it follows, by application of Lemma 3.7 and the defi-
nition of the c-functions (cf. [7], § 4), that, for every s ∈ W, each u ∈ Wv −1
and generic λ ∈ a∗qC , we have [CQ|P (X : s : λ)ψ]uv = [CQ|P (Xv : s : λ)prG,v ψ]u .
In other words,
                prG,v ◦ CQ|P (X : s : λ) = CQ|P (Xv : s : λ) ◦ prG,v .
The proof is completed by combining this equation, after substitution of P and
1 for Q and s, respectively, with the unnormalized version of (15.5) and the
definitions of the normalized Eisenstein integrals (cf. [7], eq. (49)).      

Completion of the proof of Prop. 15.1. Let v ∈ NK (aq ) be arbitrary.
Then from Lemmas 3.7, 15.2 and equation (15.4) with Xv , e and prG,v ψ in
place of X, v and ψ, respectively, it follows that, for X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,
      qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, v | fλ , X, m) = qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, e | Rv (fλ ), X, m)
                                    = E ◦ (X̃1Q,e : ∗ P : λ : m) pr
                                                                 ˜ Q,e prG,v ψ.
In the last expression the two tildes over objects indicate that the analogues of
the objects for the symmetric space Xv are taken. We now observe that X̃1Q,e
equals the space M1Q /M1Q ∩ evHv −1 e = X1Q,v . Hence, to establish (15.4), it
suffices to show that pr
                       ˜ Q,e prG,v ψ = prQ,v ψ. For this we note that pr
                                                                      ˜ Q,e is the
projection from ◦ C(G, v) onto the sum of the components parametrized by the
elements u of M1Q ∩ Wv −1 = WQ,v . Moreover, for u ∈ WQ,v ,
                 [pr
                  ˜ Q,e prG,v ψ]u = [prG,v ψ]u = ψuv = [prQ,v ψ]u .
                                                                                   

   The result just proved generalizes to partial Eisenstein integrals.

Proposition 15.3 Let P ∈ Pσmin . Let ψ ∈ ◦ C, let S ⊂ W and let the family
f = fS be defined by
                                X
                     f (λ, x) =    E+,s (P : λ : x)ψ,
                                     s∈S

see Lemma 14.6. Assume that Q ∈ Pσ contains P and that v ∈ NK (aq ). Then,
for generic λ ∈ a∗qC , and all X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,
                                    X
   qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, v | fλ , X, m) =       E+,s (X1Q,v : ∗ P : λ : m) prQ,v ψ. (15.6)

                                           101
In particular, if S ∩ WQ = ∅ then λ|aQq − ρQ ∈
                                             / Exp(Q, v | fλ ).
Proof: For S = W this result is precisely Prop. 15.1. We shall use transitivity
of asymptotics to derive the result for arbitrary S from it.
    It suffices to prove the above identity for m = bu ∈ XQ,v,+ , with u ∈ NKQ (aq )
and b ∈ ∗A+      ∗
             Qq ( P ) arbitrary.
    According to Lemma 14.3 and Remark 12.2, the function fS belongs to
  ep
C0,{0} (X+ : τ : Ω), for the full open subset Ω: = rega fS of a∗qC .
    Hence, according to Theorem 7.8 with P0 , Q and P in place of Q, P and P1 ,
respectively, for λ ∈ a∗qC generic the following holds, with [1] the class of 1 ∈ W
in W/ ∼Q|P0 = WQ \W,

qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, v | fSλ , X, bu) =      q[1],0 (Q, v | fS , X)(λ, bu)
                                        X         X
                                =                          bsλ−ρP −µ qs,µ (P, uv | fS , X + log b)(λ, e).
                                       s∈WQ µ∈N∆Q (P )


Now, for all s, t ∈ W , µ ∈ N∆ and v ∈ NK (aq ) it follows from (14.13) and
Lemma 6.2 that qs,µ (P, v | f{t} ) = 0 if s 6= t. Hence
                                 
                                   qs,µ (P, v | fW )    if s ∈ S,
             qs,µ (P, v | fS ) =
                                   0                    otherwise.

Thus, we obtain that
                                       X        X
qλ|aQq −ρQ (Q, v | fSλ , X, bu) =                        bsλ−ρ−µ qs,µ (P, uv | fW , X + log b)(λ, e).

This equation is valid for any subset S of W ; in particular, it is valid for S = W.
Using (15.4) we now obtain that, for any u ∈ NKQ (aq ) and all b ∈ ∗A+         ∗
                                                                           Qq ( P ),
                                       X        X
E ◦ (X1Q,v : ∗ P : λ : bu) prQ,v ψ =                     bsλ−ρ−µ qs,µ (P, uv | fW , X + log b)(λ, e).

This is the ∆Q (P )-exponential polynomial expansion of the Eisenstein integral
along (∗ P, u). In view of (14.12) and the remark following (14.13), with X1Q,v in
place of X, we infer from (15.8) that, for each s ∈ WQ , and every u ∈ NKQ (aq )
and b ∈ ∗A+     ∗
            Qq ( P ),
                                           X
E+,s (X1Q,v : ∗ P : λ : bu)prQ,v ψ =                 bsλ−ρ−µ qs,µ (P, uv | fW , X + log b)(λ, e).

Finally, (15.6) with m = bu follows by combining (15.7) and (15.9).                         



                                            102
   We end this section with a generalization of Proposition 15.3, involving the
application of a Laurent functional.

Proposition 15.4 Let assumptions be as in Prop. 15.3 and let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur .
Then the family L∗ f defined by L∗ f (ν, x) = L[f ( · + ν, x)], for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC
                          hyp
and x ∈ X+ , belongs to EQ,Y  (X+ : τ : δ), with Y = supp L and for a suitable
δ ∈ DQ .
   Moreover, for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC and all X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,
                                          X
 qν−ρQ (Q, v | (L∗ f )ν , X, m) = L[             E+,s (X1Q,v : ∗ P : · + ν : m) prQ,v ψ].
                                        s∈S∩WQ
                                                                                      (15.10)

In particular, if S ∩ WQ = ∅ then ν − ρQ ∈
                                         / Exp(Q, v | (L∗ f )ν ).
Proof: The first assertion follows from Cor. 14.4. For the second assertion, we
                    ep
note that L∗ f ∈ CQ,Y   (X+ : τ : Ω), where Ω is the full open subset a∗QqC \ ∪HL∗ f
     ∗
of aQqC , see Remark 12.2. The set Ω∗ : = Ω ∩ a∗◦ QqC (P, {0}) is a full open subset
of a∗QqC . Moreover, from (7.14) it follows that, for ν ∈ Ω∗ ,

     qν−ρQ (Q, v | (L∗ f )ν , X) = q[1],0 (Q, v | L∗ f, X)(ν),     (X ∈ aQq );        (15.11)

here [1] denotes the image of the identity element of W in W/ ∼Q|Q . The
expression on the right-hand side of the above equation is given by (13.5), with
P = Q, σ = [1] ∈ W/ ∼Q|Q and ξ = 0. Note that an element s ∈ W satisfies
[s] = [1] if and only if s ∈ WQ . It follows from this that [1]·Y = {0}. Hence from
(13.5) and (13.2) we conclude, with 1̄ denoting the image of 1 ∈ W in WQ \W,

last expression in (15.12) equals λ∈Y Lλ∗ [q1̄,0 (Q, v | f )(X, · )](ν). Hence from
(15.11) and (15.12) we obtain

           qν−ρQ (Q, v | (L∗ f )ν , X) = L∗ [q1̄,0 (Q, v | f )(X, · )](ν).            (15.13)

combining (15.13) with (15.14).                                           

16     Induction of relations
After the preparations of the previous sections we are now able to apply the
vanishing theorem, Theorem 12.10, to families obtained from applying Laurent
functionals to partial Eisenstein integrals. This will lead to what we call induc-
tion of relations.
    We retain the notation of the previous section. Moreover, we assume that
Q ∈ Pσ is a standard parabolic subgroup. Thus ∗ P0 : = MQ ∩ P0 is the standard
minimal σ-parabolic subgroup of MQ , relative to the positive system Σ+       Q: =
ΣQ ∩ Σ.
    We assume that Q W is a complete set of representatives in NK (aq ) for the
double coset space WQ \W/WK∩H . We also assume that for each v ∈ Q W a set
WQ,v as above (15.1) is chosen. Then one readily verifies that

                W = ∪v∈Q W WQ,v v                (disjoint union).         (16.1)

is a complete set of representatives for W/WK∩H in NK (aq ). Combining this
with (15.2) and (15.3) we find that
                             X
                                  iQ,v ◦ prQ,v = I◦ C .
                              v∈Q W

Combining (16.1) with (15.2) and (15.3), it also follows, for u, v ∈ Q W, that
                               
                                 I◦ C(Q,v)     if u = v;
                prQ,u ◦ iQ,v =                                             (16.2)
                                 0             otherwise.


Theorem 16.1 (Induction of relations) Let Lt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C be
given for each t ∈ WQ . If, for each v ∈ Q W,
      X
           Lt [E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m) ◦ prQ,v ] = 0, (m ∈ XQ,v,+ ) (16.3)
     t∈WQ


then for each s ∈ W Q the following holds as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗QqC :
              X
                    Lt [ E+,st (X : P0 : · + ν : x) ] = 0,    (x ∈ X+ ).   (16.4)
             t∈WQ


   Conversely, if the identity (16.4) holds for some s ∈ W Q and all ν in a
non-empty open subset of a∗QqC , then (16.3) holds for each v ∈ Q W.
Proof: Define for each w ∈ W the family gw : a∗QqC × X+ → Vτ ⊗ ◦ C ∗ by

                     gw (ν, x) = Lt [ E+,st (X : P0 : · + ν : x) ]

for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC and every x ∈ X+ ; the elements s ∈ W Q , t ∈ WQ are
determined by the unique product decomposition w = st (see below (14.24)).

                                          104
                                                                           hyp
    It follows from Cor. 14.4, that there exist δw ∈ DQ such that gw ∈ EQ,Y   w
                                                                                (X+ : τ : δw );
here Yw = supp Lt , where t ∈ WQ is determined as above. If we put Y = ∪Yw
                                          hyp
and δ = max(δw ), then gw belongs to EQ,Y     (X+ : τ : δ) for all w ∈ W . Moreover,
for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC ,

                      Exp(P0 , v | (gw )ν ) ⊂ w(ν + Y ) − ρ − N∆.                 (16.5)

In view of Proposition 15.4 it also follows for X ∈ aQq , m ∈ XQ,v,+ and generic
ν ∈ a∗QqC that

qν−ρQ (Q, v | (gt )ν , X, m) = Lt [E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · + ν : m) ◦ prQ,v ]    (t ∈ WQ ),
                                                                                   (16.6)

and

                    qν−ρQ (Q, v | (gw )ν , X, m) = 0      (w ∈
                                                             / WQ ).              (16.7)
                                      P                                      hyp
    According to Cor. 14.8 the family s∈W Q gst belongs
                                                     P       to thePspace EQ,Y   (X+ : τ : δ)glob
for each t ∈ WQ . Hence so does the family g = w∈W gw = t∈WQ ,s∈W Q gst .
Moreover, by (16.6) and (16.7)
                             X
qν−ρQ (Q, v | (g)ν , X, m) =     Lt [E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · +ν : m) ◦ prQ,v ]     (m ∈ XQ,v,+ ).
                              t∈WQ


From Theorem 12.10 we now see that (16.3) holds for each v ∈ Q W if and only
if g = 0.                          P
    On the other hand, let g s = t∈WQ gst for s ∈ W Q . It follows from (16.5)
that
                   Exp(P0 , v | (g s )ν ) ⊂ sν + W Y − ρ − N∆.
Since the latter sets are mutually disjoint as s runs over W Q , for ν in a full
open subset (see Lemma 6.2), we conclude that for such ν,

           (sν + W Y − ρ − N∆) ∩ Exp(P0 , v | gν ) = Exp(P0 , v | (g s )ν ).

Hence g = 0 implies that g s = 0 for each s ∈ W Q . Conversely it follows from
Corollary 9.15 that g = 0 if g s = 0 for some s ∈ W Q . The theorem follows
immediately.                                                                 


Corollary 16.2 Let v ∈ Q W and let Lt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v) be given
for each t ∈ WQ . If
             X
                 Lt [E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m)] = 0, (m ∈ XQ,v,+ )         (16.8)

                                           105
then for each s ∈ W Q the following holds as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗QqC :
        X
             Lt [ E+,st (X : P0 : · + ν : x) ◦ iQ,v ] = 0, (x ∈ X+ ).     (16.9)
       t∈WQ

   Conversely, if the identity (16.9) holds for some s ∈ W Q and all ν in a
non-empty open subset of a∗QqC , then (16.8) holds.
Proof: For t ∈ WQ we define the functional L◦t ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C by
L◦t = [I ⊗ iQ,v ](Lt ). Then for F ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ ) ⊗ ◦ C ∗ we have

                                L◦t F = Lt [F ( · ) iQ,v ].                    (16.10)

Let u ∈ Q W. Then from (16.2) and (16.8) we deduce that (16.3) holds with u
and L◦t in place of v and Lt , respectively. It follows that (16.4) holds with L◦t
in place of Lt . In view of (16.10) this implies (16.9). The converse statement is
seen similarly.                                                                 

    Another useful formulation of the principle of induction of relations is the
following.

Corollary 16.3 Let v ∈ Q W. Let Lt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur and ϕt ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)⊗
◦
 C(Q, v) be given for each t ∈ WQ . Assume that
    X
         Lt [E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m)ϕt ( · + ν)] = 0, (m ∈ XQ,v,+ )  (16.11)
    t∈WQ

for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC . Define ψt = (I ⊗ iQ,v )ϕt ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ) ⊗ ◦ C, for t ∈ WQ .
Then, for each s ∈ W Q ,
          X
               Lt [E+,st (X : P0 : · + ν : x)ψt ( · + ν)] = 0,  (x ∈ X+ )
           t∈WQ

as an identity of Vτ -valued meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC .
Proof: Let H be a Σ-configuration such that sing(ϕt ) ⊂ ∪H, for each t ∈ WQ .
Moreover, let Y = ∪t∈WQ supp Lt ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC . Fix t ∈ WQ . Let H′ : = Ha∗QqC (Y ) be
the Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC defined as in Corollary 11.6. Let ν ∈ a∗QqC \∪H′ ;
then the function ϕνt : λ 7→ ϕt (λ + ν) belongs to M(∗ a∗QqC , Y, ΣQ ). It follows from
(10.7) that the functional Lνt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗ ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v) defined by
                          Lνt [F ( · )]: = Lt [F ( · )ϕt ( · + ν)],
for F ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ ) ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v)∗ , is a ◦ C(Q, v)-valued ΣQ -Laurent functional
on ∗ a∗QqC . The hypothesis (16.11) may be rewritten as (16.8) with Lνt in place of
Lt , for each t ∈ WQ . By application of Corollary 16.2 we therefore obtain, for
ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H′ , that
                   X
                       Lt [ E+,st (X : P0 : · + µ : x) ψt ( · + ν) ] = 0     (16.12)

as an identity of Vτ -valued meromorphic functions in the variable µ ∈ a∗QqC . Ac-
cording to Lemma 11.9 the expression in this equation defines a meromorphic
Vτ -valued function on a∗QqC × a∗QqC whose restriction to the diagonal is a mero-
morphic function on a∗QqC . Thus, if we substitute ν for µ in (16.12), we obtain
an identity of Vτ -valued meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC .     



Corollary 16.4 Let L1 , L2 ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C. If, for each v ∈ Q W,

L1 [E+ (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m) ◦ prQ,v ] = L2 [E ◦ (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m) ◦ prQ,v ],     (m ∈ XQ,v,+ )
                                                                                    (16.13)

then the following holds as a Vτ -valued meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗QqC :
       X
L1 [           E+,s (X : P0 : · + ν : x) ] = L2 [ E ◦ (X : P0 : · + ν : x) ],   (x ∈ X+ ).
       s∈W Q
                                                                                    (16.14)

In particular, for regular values of ν, the expression on the left extends smoothly
in the variable x to all of X.
     Conversely, if the identity (16.14) holds for ν in a non-empty open subset of
a∗QqC , then (16.13) holds for each v ∈ Q W.
                                                             P
Proof: It follows from (14.12) that E ◦ (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : λ) = t∈WQ E+,t (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : λ).
Define Lt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C for t ∈ WQ as follows. If t = e then
Lt : = L2 − L1 , and otherwise Lt : = L2 . Then the hypothesis (16.3) in Theorem
16.1 follows from (16.13). Hence the conclusion (16.4) holds for each s ∈ W Q .
By summation over s this implies that
          X X
                     Lt [E+,st (X : P0 : · + ν : x)] = 0,   (x ∈ X+ )        (16.15)
         s∈W Q t∈WQ

which, by the definition of the operators Lt is equivalent to (16.14).
    For the converse, let g s (ν, x) denote the expression in (16.4), as in the proof
of Theorem 16.1, with Lt specified as above. Then it was seen in the mentioned
proof that if the sum g of the g s vanishes then so does each g s separately. Now
(16.14) implies (16.15) which exactly reads that g = 0. Thus (16.4) holds for
each s ∈ W Q , so that the converse statement in Theorem 16.1 can be applied.

   The result just proved allows a straightforward corollary similar to Corollary
16.2, in which the maps iQ,v are used instead of the maps prQ,v . We omit the
details. The following result is derived from Corollary 16.3 in exactly the same
way as the first part of Corollary 16.4 was derived from Theorem 16.1.

functionals on ∗ a∗QqC , and let ϕ1 , ϕ2 ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ) ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v). Assume that

    L1 (E+ (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m)ϕ1 ( · + ν)) = L2 (E ◦ (XQ,v : ∗ P0 : · : m)ϕ2 ( · + ν)),

Corollary 16.6 Let v ∈ Q W and let ψt ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ ) ⊗ ◦ C(Q, v) be given
for each t ∈ WQ . Let λ0 ∈ ∗ a∗QqC . Assume that for each m ∈ XQ,v,+ , the
meromorphic Vτ -valued function on a∗QqC , given by

is also regular at λ0 .
Proof: The function in (16.16) has a germ at λ0 in M(∗ a∗QqC , λ0 , ΣQ ). By
Lemma 10.7 it suffices to show that it is annihilated by M(∗ a∗QqC , λ0 , ΣQ )∗O    laur .
Let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , λ0 , ΣQ )∗O
                             laur and define Lt ∈ M(∗ ∗

by Lt = m∗ψt L, see (10.7). The desired conclusion now follows from Corollary
16.2.                                                                                  

    We shall now give an equivalent formulation of the induction of relations. We
call it the lifting principle. For the group case a similar principle was formulated
by Casselman, see [1], Thm. II.4.1, however with Eisenstein integrals that carry
a different normalization.

Definition 16.7 The space Alaur (X+ : τ ) is defined as the space of functions

                                x 7→ L[E+ (P0 : · : x)] ∈ Vτ

where L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C. It is a linear subspace of C ∞ (X+ : τ ).
   It follows from Corollary 14.4 with Q = G that Alaur (X+ : τ ) consists of
D(X)-finite functions in C ep (X+ : τ ).


                                              108
Remark 16.8 Let L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗◦ C. Then L[ϕ( · )E+ (P0 : · )] ∈ Alaur (X+ : τ )
for all ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ) (see (10.7)). In particular, it follows from (14.18) that
C ◦ (s : · ) ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)⊗ End(◦ C). Hence it follows from the identity (14.14) that
L[E+,s (P0 : · )] ∈ Alaur (X+ : τ ) for each s ∈ W . Moreover, by similar reasoning
it can be seen that the space Alaur (X+ : τ ) does not depend on the choice of
P0 ∈ Pσmin.


Remark 16.9 Let λ0 ∈ a∗qC and ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ) ⊗ ◦ C, and assume that λ 7→
E+ (P0 : λ)ϕ(λ) is regular at λ0 . Then the function x 7→ u[E+ (P0 : λ : x)ϕ(λ)]|λ=λ0
belongs to Alaur (X+ : τ ) for each u ∈ S(a∗q ) (see the previous remark and Lemma
10.15). Moreover, it follows easily from the definition of M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur that
Alaur (X+ : τ ) is spanned by functions of this form.


Theorem 16.10 (Lifting principle) Let Q ∈ Pσ be a standard parabolic sub-
group, and let s ∈ W Q be fixed.

Proof: The uniqueness is clear from Definition 16.7. We use (16.17) and
(16.18) as the definition of F+,s,v ; the fact that F+,s,v (ϕ) is well defined for all
ϕ ∈ Alaur (XQ,v,+ : τQ ) is equivalent with the first statement in Theorem 16.1
(see also Corollary 16.2). Once the definition makes sense, it is easily seen that
F+,s,v (ϕ) depends linearly on ϕ. That F+,s,v (ϕ, ν) ∈ Alaur (X+ : τ ) for generic
ν is seen from Lemma 11.7. Finally, the injectivity of F+,s is equivalent with
the final statement of Theorem 16.1.                                                

17      Appendix A: spaces of holomorphic functions
If Ω is a complex analytic manifold, then by O(Ω) we denote the space of
holomorphic and by M(Ω) the space of meromorphic functions on Ω.
    If V is a complete locally convex (Hausdorff) space, we say that a function
ϕ: Ω → V is holomorphic if for every a ∈ Ω there exists a holomorphic coordi-
natisation z = (z1 , . . . , zn ) at a such that in a neighborhood of a the function
ϕ is expressible as a converging V -valued power series in the coordinates z. The
space of such holomorphic functions is denoted by O(Ω, V ). We equip this space
with a locally convex topology as follows. Let P be a separating collection of
continuous seminorms for V. For every p ∈ P and every compact set K ⊂ Ω we
define the seminorm νK,p on O(Ω, V ) by νK,p (ϕ) = supK p ◦ ϕ. This collection
of seminorms is separating hence equips O(Ω, V ) with a locally convex topol-
ogy. Note that this topology is independent of the choice of P. Moreover, it is
complete; it is Fréchet if V is a Fréchet space.
    We recall that O(Ω, V ) is a closed subspace of C ∞ (Ω, V ). Indeed, if ∂¯ denotes
the anti-linear part of exterior differentiation, then O(Ω, V ) is the kernel of ∂¯
in C ∞ (Ω, V ).
    A densely defined function ϕ: Ω → V is called meromorphic if for every a ∈ Ω
there exists an open neighborhood U of a, and a function ψ ∈ O(U ) \ {0} such
that ψϕ ∈ O(U, V ). As usual, meromorphic functions are considered to be equal
if they coincide on a dense open subset. The space of V -valued meromorphic
functions on Ω is denoted by M(Ω, V ). If ϕ is an V -valued meromorphic function
on Ω we define reg(ϕ) to be the largest open subset U of Ω for which ϕ|U
coincides (densely) with an element of O(U, V ). The complement sing(ϕ) =
Ω \ reg(ϕ) is called the singular locus of ϕ.

Lemma 17.1 Let X be a C ∞ and Ω a complex analytic manifold. Let V be a
complete locally convex space.

                                         110
   Let F be the locally convex space of C ∞ -functions X × Ω → V that are
holomorphic in the second variable. Given f ∈ F and x ∈ X, we define the
function 1 f (x): Ω → V by 1 f (x)(z) = f (x, z). Given z ∈ Ω we define the
function 2 f (z): X → V by 2 f (z)(x) = f (x, z).
 (a) The map f 7→ 1 f defines a natural isomorphism of locally convex spaces
     from F onto C ∞ (X, O(Ω, V )).
 (b) The map f 7→ 2 f defines a natural isomorphism of locally convex spaces
     from F onto O(Ω, C ∞ (X, V )).
In particular, the above maps lead to a natural isomorphism

                     C ∞ (X, O(Ω, V )) ≃ O(Ω, C ∞ (X, V )).

Proof: The above isomorphisms are valid with O replaced by C ∞ everywhere.
This is a well known fact, and basically a straightforward consequence of the
definitions, though somewhat tedious to check. The isomorphisms with O are
seen to be valid by showing that the appropriate kernels of the operator ∂¯ cor-
respond. Checking this involves a local application of the multivariable Cauchy
integral formula.                                                             



18     Appendix B: removable singularities
We discuss a variation on the idea of removable singularities for holomorphic
functions that is particularly useful for application in the present paper.
    A subset T of a finite dimensional complex analytic manifold Ω will be called
thin if for every λ ∈ Ω there exists a connected open neighborhood U and a
non-zero holomorphic function ϕ ∈ O(U ) such that T ∩ U ⊂ ϕ−1 (0), see [21],
p. 19. An open subset U of Ω will be called full if its complement is thin. It
is clear that a full subset of Ω is dense in Ω. Note that the union of finitely
many thin subsets is thin again; accordingly, the intersection of finitely many
full open subsets of Ω is again a full open subset. Obviously any union of full
open subsets is a full open subset. Note also that if Ω is connected, then every
full open subset of Ω is connected ([21] p. 20).

Lemma 18.1 Let j: V → W be an injective continuous linear map of complete
locally convex Hausdorf spaces, and let F be a W -valued holomorphic function
on a complex analytic manifold Ω. Assume that there exists a full open subset Ω0
of Ω and a holomorphic function G0 : Ω0 → V such that such that F = j ◦ G0 on
Ω0 . Then there exists a unique holomorphic map G: Ω → V such that j ◦ G = F.
Proof: Clearly the result is of a local nature in the Ω-variable, so that we may
assume that Ω is a connected open subset of Cn , for some n ∈ N. Moreover, we
may as well assume that Ω0 = Ω\ϕ−1 (0), with ϕ ∈ O(Ω) a non-zero holomorphic
function.


                                      111
    Fix λ0 ∈ Ω. Since ϕ is non-zero, the function z 7→ ϕ(λ0 + zµ), defined on a
neighborhood of 0 in C, is non-zero for some µ ∈ Cn \ {0}. Being holomorphic,
this function then takes the value 0 in isolated points. Hence we may choose µ
such that λ0 + zµ ∈ Ω0 for 0 < |z| ≤ 1. By compactness there exists an open
neighborhood N0 of λ0 in Ω such that λ + zµ ∈ Ω for all λ ∈ N0 and z ∈ C with
|z| ≤ 1, and such that λ + zµ ∈ Ω0 for |z| = 1. By the Cauchy integral formula
we have:
                                     Z
                                  1                  dz
                         F (λ) =          F (λ + zµ) .                   (18.1)
                                 2πi ∂D              z

Here ∂D denotes the boundary of the unit circle in C, equipped with the orien-
tation induced by the complex structure, i.e., the counter clockwise direction.
    Note that the W -valued (or V -valued) integration is well defined, since W (or
V ) is complete locally convex. In the integrand of (18.1) the function F (λ + zµ)
may be replaced by j(G0 (λ + zµ)). Using that j is continuous linear we then
obtain that

                                   F (λ) = j(G(λ)),                         (18.2)

where                          Z
                          1                        dz
                 G(λ): =             G0 (λ + zµ)        (λ ∈ N0 ).
                         2πi   ∂D                  z
Clearly G: N0 → V is a holomorphic function; moreover, it is uniquely de-
termined by equation (18.2), since j is injective. This implies that the local
definition of G is independent of the particular choice of µ. Moreover, it also
follows from (18.2) and the injectivity of j that all local definitions match and
determine a global holomorphic function G: Ω → V satisfying our requirement.



Corollary 18.2 Let Ω0 be a full open subset of a complex analytic manifold Ω
and let X0 be a dense open subset of a C ∞ -manifold X. Moreover, let F : Ω ×
X0 → C be a C ∞ function that is holomorphic in its first variable, and assume
that its restriction to Ω0 × X0 has a smooth extension to Ω0 × X. Then the
function F has a unique smooth extension to Ω × X. Moreover, the extension is
holomorphic in its first variable.
Proof: As in the proof of the above lemma we may as well assume that Ω is
an open subset of Cn , for some n.
    Let V = C ∞ (X) and W = C ∞ (X0 ) be equipped with the usual Fréchet
topologies. Restriction to X0 induces an injective continuous linear map j: V →
W.
    By Lemma 17.1(b) we see that the function Fe: Ω → W, defined by Fe (z) =
F (z, · ) is holomorphic. Let G0 be the extension of (z, x) 7→ F (z, x) to a smooth
map Ω0 × X → C. Then by density and continuity the function G0 satisfies
the Cauchy-Riemann equations in its first variable. Hence it is holomorphic


                                         112

in its first variable, and it follows that the function G
Ge 0 (z) = G0 (z, · ) is holomorphic. From the definitions given we obtain that
Fe = j ◦ G e0 on Ω0 . By the above lemma there exists a unique holomorphic
function G:e Ω → V such that Fe = j ◦ G.
                                       e The function G: (z, x) 7→ G(z)(x)
                                                                   e       is the
desired extension of F.                                                        
