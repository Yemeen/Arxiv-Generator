                                                Let V be a finite-dimensional complex vector space. A nilpotent linear
                                             map N : V → V is said to fix a flag F = {F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn−1 ⊂ V }
                                             if N Fi ⊆ Fi−1 for each i. The variety BN of all flags in the flag manifold
                                             F l(V ) fixed by a nilpotent map N is a Springer fiber. Such varieties arise
                                             as fibers of Springer’s resolution of singularities of the nilpotent cone of a
                                             reductive algebraic group G.
                                                Springer[25] discovered a method of constructing irreducible represen-
                                             tations of Weyl groups on the top homology of BN . For each irreducible
                                             representation, his construction yields a distinguished basis given by ho-
                                             mology classes of the components of the Springer fiber BN . However, since
                                             their mere existence yields the distinguished basis, it seems that efforts to
                                             understand them have not focused on computations of their internal topo-
                                             logical structure or that of their intersections. Only a few papers (such
                                             as Spaltenstein[24], Vargas[28], Wolper[30], Lorist[21], Güemes[14]) have

studied the topology of the components of the Springer fibers BN and their
intersections. We extend some of these results to describe the homological
structure of components of BN and their pairwise intersections for certain
types of nilpotent maps N (those corresponding to hook and two-row shape
partitions). In these cases, the components are nonsingular, and in fact are
iterated bundles of flag manifolds and Grassmannians. For more general
nilpotent maps N , the components can be singular (see Vargas[28] and
Spaltenstein[24]) and much more complicated.
   We also relate our computations to the structure of the Kazhdan-Lusztig
bases of certain representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type A. The
inner products of these basis vectors, suitably normalized, are polynomi-
als in t and t−1 that are invariant under the map t → t−1 . We show
that for irreducible representations labeled by a hook or two-row shape,
the (suitably normalized) inner products equal the intersection homology
Poincaré polynomials of pairwise intersections of irreducible components
of Springer fibers of the general linear group. We believe it would be very
interesting to understand how our results might generalize to bases of other
Kazhdan-Lusztig representations of type A.

      2. SOME PROPERTIES OF NILPOTENT MAPS AND
                   SPRINGER FIBERS
    We record some properties of nilpotent maps and of the space of all flags
BN fixed by a nilpotent map N , which is called the Springer fiber of N .
A theorem of Vargas and Spaltenstein [28] [24] decomposes the space BN
into a disjoint union of locally closed subspaces, whose closures are the
irreducible components of the space BN .
    Let N : V → V be a nilpotent map of a vector space V over C. Let b be
the least positive integer for which N b = 0. Then we have two filtrations of
subspaces on V : the image filtration im N b = 0 ⊂ im N b−1 ⊂ im N b−2 ⊂
· · · ⊂ im N 1 ⊂ V = im N 0 and the kernel filtration ker N 0 = 0 ⊂ ker N ⊂
ker N 2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ ker N b−1 ⊂ V = ker N b (with proper inclusions).



    Lemma 2.1. For a nilpotent map N , we have N −1 (im N k ) = ker N +
im N k−1 .


    Proof. If N (v) ∈ im N k then N (v) = N k (w) so N (v − N k−1 w) = 0.
  Note that if im N k−1 contains ker N then N −1 (im N k ) = im N k−1 ;
otherwise N −1 (im N k ) is strictly larger. Also note that N (ker N i+1 ) ⊆
im N ∩ ker N i .
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                            3

  Definition 2.1. Let Fi be a subspace of V that is taken into itself by
the map N . Then there is a map Ni : V /Fi → V /Fi induced by N . We
call the map Ni a quotient map of N .



   Lemma 2.2. The image im Ni of the quotient map Ni : V /Fi → V /Fi
is equal to (im N + Fi )/Fi . Similarly, (im N k + Fi )/Fi = im Nik .


   Proof. If N (v) ∈ im N then N (v) + Fi ∈ im Ni . On the other hand, if
w+Fi ∈ im Ni then the coset w+Fi equals the coset N (v)+Fi for some v ∈
V , so w + Fi is clearly in im N + Fi . Then a subspace of V that contains Fi
and whose projection to V /Fi is im Ni must be im N + Fi . The same holds
true for the nilpotent map N k .

  Lemma 2.3. The kernel of the quotient map ker Ni equals N −1 (Fi ).


   Proof. The kernel ker Ni is given by those vectors whose image under Ni
is 0 + Fi , which is exactly N −1 (Fi ).

  Lemma 2.4. We have the containment ker N ⊇ im N b−1 , but ker N 6⊇
im N b−j for j > 1.


  Proof. This is obvious from definition of b.

  Lemma 2.5. If j is the largest integer for which im N j is not contained
in Fi , then j is the largest integer for which (im N j + Fi )/Fi is a nonzero
image of the quotient map Ni .


   Proof. Suppose v ∈ im N j but is not in Fi . Then v + Fi is not zero in
V /Fi , so (im N j + Fi )/Fi is a nonzero image of Ni . Similarly, if v + Fi is a
nonzero element of (im N j +Fi )/Fi , then there exists an element 0 6= w ∈ V
with w ∈ im N j and w ∈ v + Fi .
   Now we discuss the Springer fiber BN of N , which is the variety of flags
fixed by the nilpotent element N . The ranks of the Jordan blocks of the
nilpotent map N determine a partition of n. We form a Young shape from
this partition by using this partition as the lengths of the rows (opposite
to the conventions of Vargas[28]). Let the number of columns of the Young
shape be b; then N b = 0 and N b−1 6= 0.
4                           FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


    Definition 2.2.      Given a flag F with subspaces {0} = F0 ⊆ F1 ⊆
· · · ⊆ Fn = V , we say that N fixes F if N Fi is contained in Fi−1 for all i.


  Definition 2.3.       We denote by BN the set of all flags fixed by N ,
and call it the Springer fiber of N . It is an algebraic subvariety of the flag
manifold B.


   Recall that Young shape on n boxes is a collection of n boxes arranged
in left justified rows of lengths t1 ≥ · · · ≥ tk . A standard tableau (or Young
tableau) on a Young shape τ is constructed by filling in the n boxes with the
numbers 1, . . . , n such that the numbers are decreasing from left to right
in each row, and decreasing from top to bottom in each column. Note that
many authors use increasing rows and columns. We typically use A and B
to denote standard Young tableaux. Denote by Ai the tableau obtained by
deleting the numbers 1, . . . , i in the tableau A and subtracting i from the
remaining numbers.
   The following theorem of Vargas and Spaltenstein gives a decomposition
of the Springer fiber BN into a disjoint union of locally closed subsets,
whose closures comprise the irreducible components of BN .

   Theorem 2.1. (Vargas[28], Spaltenstein[24]) Let N be a nilpotent map.
Then given a standard tableau A on the Young shape of N , we construct a
locally closed subset SV (A) of the Springer fiber BN , whose closure SV (A)
is an irreducible component of BN . We have a partition BN = ∪A SV (A)
of the Springer fiber into disjoint locally closed subsets. Thus the number
of irreducible components of BN is equal to the number of standard tableaux
on the Young shape of N . In addition, the components are all of the same
dimension. In fact, if the lengths of the columns of the Young shape of N
are n1 , n2 , . . . , nb , then the dimension of each component is

                               X ni (ni − 1)
                                               .
                                 i
                                        2



   Proof. Suppose A is a Young tableau on the Young shape of N . Then
we inductively specify a subset of BN corresponding to A, which we denote
SV (A) (for Spaltenstein-Vargas), by describing how to choose F1 , then
F2 /F1 , and so forth. A flag F is in the the subset SV (A) if each subspace
of F satisfies the following conditions.
   Suppose the number i appears in the c(i)-th column in A. Then (re-
calling that F0 = 0) the first subspace F1 must satisfy F1 ⊂ (N −1 (F0 ) ∩
                   TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                                  5

(im N c(1)−1 − im N c(1) ). In other words, F1 must be in the kernel of N ,
and it must be in the (c(1) − 1)st image of N but not in any higher image.
   Then, for any F1 satisfying the above condition, the induced map N1 :
V /F1 → V /F1 will have the same Young shape; this shape is the shape
obtained by deleting the number 1 in the tableau A.
   We now choose F2 /F1 ⊂ V /F1 , using the above procedure with N1 in
place of N and A1 in place of A. Note that N1−1 (0+F1 ) = N −1 (F1 )/F1 . We
continue inductively, choosing Fi+1 /Fi so that Fi+1 /Fi ⊂ (N −1 (Fi )/Fi ) ∩
       c(i)−1       c(i)
(im Ni        −im Ni ). Note that any such choice of Fi+1 yields a quotient
map Ni+1 with Young shape Ai+1 .
   See Vargas[28] and Spaltenstein[24] for the proof that this constructs a
locally closed subset of BN with the properties claimed in the theorem.
The proof is essentially an explicit calculation with the Jordan form of N .
   Vargas([28], Proposition 2.2) shows that this set SV (A) is exactly the
set of flags such that

                                       Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 )
                             Fi ⊂ Fi−1 + im N c(i)−1 .




    3. DETERMINATION OF THE TOPOLOGY OF THE
  IRREDUCIBLE COMPONENTS OF SPRINGER FIBERS
  FOR NILPOTENT MAPS OF HOOK TYPE FOR GLN (C).
  Suppose N is a nilpotent map V → V whose Jordan form has at most
one Jordan block of rank > 1. Then N is said to be of hook type. For
hook type nilpotent maps N , we can characterize the components of the
Springer fiber BN entirely in terms of the image and kernel filtrations of V .
The components and their intersections will turn out to be nonsingular. In
fact their homology Poincaré polynomials factor as products of Poincaré
polynomials of Grassmannians and flag manifolds.
  We will describe each component of the Springer fiber of a nilpotent map
N of hook type by expressing the component as a sequence of fiber bundles
with progressively simpler bases and fibers.
  Definition 3.1.           A space X1 is an iterated fiber bundle of base type
(B1 , . . . , Bn ) if there exist spaces X1 , B1 , X2 , B2 , . . . , Xn , Bn , Xn+1 = pt
and maps p1 , p2 , . . . , pn such that pj : Xj → Bj is a fiber bundle with
typical fiber Xj+1 .


  The following two lemmas are straightforward.
6                             FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


   Lemma 3.1. : The flag manifold F l(V ) admits a map to the Grass-
mannian Gi (V ) via F 7→ Fi . The fiber of this map is a product F l(Fi ) ×
F l(V /Fi ).


   Lemma 3.2. Consider the variety of flags X(I, K) in an n-dimensional
vector space V such that Fi contains an a-dimensional subspace I and is
contained in a b-dimensional subspace K. This variety X(I, K) admits a
map p : X(I, K) → Gi−a (K/I) via F 7→ Fi /I ⊂ K/I that makes X(I, K)
the total space of a fiber bundle. The typical fiber of the map p is a product
F l(Fi ) × F l(V /Fi ). In particular, the variety X(I, K) is nonsingular.

  We define some notation to simplify our intersection homology compu-
tations. Define [n] by

                  [n] := t−(n−1) (1 + t2 + t4 + · · · + t2(n−1) ).

Then we define
                                              
                                              [n]         [n]!
                [n]! := [1][2] . . . [n] and      :=              .
                                              [k]    [k]![n − k]!

   The polynomial [n] is essentially the t-analogue of the number n, but
shifted to be symmetric around the degree 0 term. Thus the flag manifold
F l(V ) has intersection homology Poincaré polynomial [n]! and Gk (V ) has
intersection homology Poincaré polynomial [n]
                                                 
                                             [k]
                                                  .

  Corollary 3.1. Let X(I) be the variety of flags in F l(V ) such that
the the subspace Fi contains an a-dimensional subspace I. Then X(I) has
intersection homology Poincaré polynomial [n−a]
                                                 
                                           [i−a]
                                                  [i]![n − i]!.


  Proof. Clear from Lemma 3.2, since complex flag manifolds and complex
Grassmannians have only even-dimensional homology so the Leray-Serre
spectral sequence for p : X(I) → Gi−a (V /I) with fiber F l(Fi ) × F l(V /Fi )
collapses.

   Lemma 3.3. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type with Jordan blocks of
size (b, 1, . . . , 1). Then for all 0 < i < b, we have im N b−i = ker N i ∩ im N ,
which implies N (ker N i+1 ) ⊂ im N b−i .


    Proof. This follows from inspection of the Jordan form of N .
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                             7

   We now decompose each component of the Springer fiber BN for a hook
type nilpotent map N as an iterated bundle with nonsingular bases and
fibers. Recall that the number b is the least positive integer with N b = 0.
                                             b(i)
Let b(i) be the least positive integer with Ni = 0.
   Theorem 3.1. Suppose we are given a nilpotent map N of hook type
and a Young tableau A on the Young shape of N with n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 on
the top row (where by convention ib = n and i0 = 0). Then the com-
ponent KA of the Springer fiber BN is an iterated bundle with B2j−1 =
                            b(i )−1
Gij −ij−1 −1 (ker Nij / im Nij j ) and B2j = F l(Fij /Fij−1 ), where j = 1, 2, . . . , b−
1, and B2b−1 is a full flag manifold F l(V /Fib−1 ).

  The proof will be broken up into a series of lemmas and propositions.
   Proposition 3.1. (Vargas[28]) Suppose we are given a nilpotent map
N of hook type and a Young tableau A on the Young shape of N with
n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 on the top row. Then the component KA = SV (A) of the
Springer fiber BN consists of all flags F in F l(V ) such that

                            im N b−1 ⊆ Fi1 ⊆ ker N
                           im N b−2 ⊆ Fi2 ⊆ ker N 2
                           im N b−3 ⊆ Fi3 ⊆ ker N 3
                                     ...
                          im N 1 ⊆ Fib−1 ⊆ ker N b−1 .



   Proof. This is Vargas[28], Theorem 4.1. The proof consists of an explicit
limiting argument using the structure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset
SV (A).

  Lemma 3.4. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type, and let Fi1 be a
subspace of V with N Fi1 ⊂ Fi1 and im N b−1 ⊂ Fi1 ⊂ ker N . Then we
have

                            ker Nid1 = ker N d+1 /Fi1
                         im Nid1 = (im N d + Fi1 )/Fi1 .



  Proof. We describe ker Nid1 ⊆ V /Fi as follows. If v ∈ ker N d+1 then
N d (v) ∈ im N ∩ ker N = im N b−1 . Since im N b−1 ⊆ Fi1 , we have N d (v) ∈
8                            FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


Fi1 , so v + Fi1 ∈ ker Nid1 . On the other hand, if Nid1 (v + Fi1 ) = 0 + Fi1 then
N d (v) ∈ Fi1 . Now by Lemma 3.3, the subspace Fi1 contains im N b−1 but
no other element of im N . Thus N d+1 (v) = 0, and so v ∈ ker N d+1 . Thus
if a subspace W ⊂ V contains Fi1 then W/Fi1 ⊆ ker Nid1 iff W ⊆ ker N d+1 .
   By Lemma 2.2 im (N d +Fi1 )/Fi1 = im Nid1 . Thus if W ⊂ V contains Fi1 ,
then W/Fi1 contains im Nid1 iff W contains im N d .

  Lemma 3.5. Suppose we are given a nilpotent N of hook type and a
Young tableau A on the Young shape of N with n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 on the top row
(where by convention ib = n and i0 = 0). Then the component KA of the
Springer fiber BN admits a map p1 to the Grassmannian Gi1 −1 (ker N/ im N b−1 ).
The fiber X2 of the map p1 : KA → Gi1 −1 (ker N/ im N b−1 ) admits a map
p2 : X2 → F l(Fi1 ). The fiber of p2 can be identified with a component
of a Springer fiber of the quotient map Ni1 : V /Fi1 → V /Fi1 , where the
component is associated to the standard tableau Ai1 .


   Proof. The existence of the map p1 follows from Lemma 3.2 with I =
im N b−1 (which is a 1-dimensional space) and K = ker N (which is an n −
b + 1-dimensional space containing im N b−1 ). Let B1 be the Grassmannian
Gi1 −1 (ker N/ im N b−1 ). The fiber X2 of the map p1 : KA → B1 consists
of all flags in the component with a fixed subspace Fi1 . We define the map
p2 : X2 → F l(Fi1 ) by taking F ∈ X2 and forgetting all subspaces of F
larger than Fi1 . By inspecting Proposition 3.1 we see that p2 is surjective
and indeed a fiber bundle projection.
   The fiber X3 of this map p2 is the set of all flags in the component KA
with fixed subspaces F1 , . . . , Fi1 . Then X3 maps bijectively to a subset of
F l(V /Fi1 ) via the map F → F ′ , where Fj′ = Fj+i1 /Fi1 . We now show that
X3 is the component KAi1 of the Springer fiber of the quotient map Ni1
on V /Fi1 , by showing that X3 satisfies the characterization of Proposition
3.1.
   By Lemma 3.4, the fiber X3 of p2 is in bijection with the set of flags
F ′ ∈ F l(V /Fi1 ) such that

                         im Nib−2
                              1
                                  ⊆ Fi′2 −i1 ⊆ ker Ni1
                         im Nib−3
                              1
                                  ⊆ Fi′3 −i1 ⊆ ker Ni21
                         im Nib−4
                              1
                                  ⊆ Fi′3 −i1 ⊆ ker Ni31
                                       ...
                        im Ni11 ⊆ Fi′b−1 −i1 ⊆ ker Nib−2
                                                     1
                                                         .

Thus X3 is the component KAi1 of the Springer fiber BN1 .

   Proof. (of Theorem 3.1) A typical fiber X2 of the map p2 : KA →
F l(Fi1 ) consists of flags F ∈ KA with fixed subspaces F1 , . . . , Fi1 . This
fiber X2 is in bijection with the set of flags in V /Fi1 that are fixed by
Ni1 : V /Fi1 → V /Fi1 .
   So we have exhibited the component KA = X1 of the Springer fiber BN as
the total space of a bundle p1 : X1 → B1 with base B1 = Gi1 −1 (ker N/ im N b−1 ).
The fiber X2 of p1 is the total space of another bundle p2 : X2 → B2 with
base B2 = F l(V /Fi1 ).
   Successive applications of Lemma 3.5 prove that if X2j+1 is a component
of the Springer fiber of Nij : V /Fij → V /Fij , then X2j+3 is the correspond-
ing component of the Springer fiber for Nij+1 : V /Fij+1 → V /Fij+1 .
   Finally, since im N ⊂ Fib−1 , we see that the map Nib−1 : V /Fib−1 →
V /Fib−1 is the zero map. Thus the (unique) component of the Springer
fiber for Nib−1 (which is X2b−1 ) is the flag manifold F l(V /Fib−1 ).

   Theorem 3.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type, and let A be
a standard tableau on the hook shape of N , with top row n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 .
Then the component KA of the Springer fiber BN has intersection homology
Poincaré polynomial equal to
                                                                                      
        [n − b]              [(n − i1 ) − (b − 1)]                         [(n − ib−2 − 2]
[i1 ]!           [i2 − i1 ]!                        . . . [ib−1 − ib−2 ]!                   [n − ib−1 ]!.
        [i1 − 1]                 [i2 − i1 − 1]                            [ib−1 − ib−2 − 1]

  This polynomial equals

             [n − b]![i1 ][i2 − i1 ][i3 − i2 ] . . . [ib−1 − ib−2 ][n − ib−1 ].



   Proof.
   We have already proven that the component in question is an iterated
fiber bundle with B2j a complex flag manifold, with B2j−1 a complex
Grassmannian for 1 ≤ j ≤ b − 1, and with X2b−1 = B2b−1 a complex
flag manifold. So the bundle p2b−2 : X2b−2 → B2b−2 with fiber X2b−1
has only even-dimensional homology in base and fiber. Therefore the
Leray-Serre spectral sequence for p2b−2 collapses and the Poincaré poly-
nomial of X2b−2 is the product of those for X2b−1 and B2b−2 ; in particular,
X2b−1 has only even-dimensional homology. Then we do the same for
p2b−3 : X2b−3 → B2b−3 with fiber X2b−2 ; since B2b−3 is a complex Grass-
mannian, the space X2b−3 also has only even-dimensional homology. So
X2b−3 , X2b−5 , . . . have only even-dimensional homology and their homol-
ogy Poincaré polynomials are products of Poincaré polynomials of flag man-
ifolds and Grassmannians. This recursion thus unravels to give us the ho-
mology of X1 as stated above. Finally, since the space X1 is nonsingular, we
10                          FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


need only shift the homology Poincaré polynomial until it is invariant under
t 7→ t−1 , in order to obtain the intersection homology Poincaré polyno-
mial.
  Remark 3. 1. We have proven that the closed subvariety of BN associ-
ated by Vargas’ description to the tableau A is irreducible because this sub-
variety is a bundle of irreducible varieties; it also contains a Spaltenstein-
Vargas set SV (A); hence it must be exactly the closure KA of the Spaltenstein-
Vargas set SV (A). This is an alternative proof that Vargas’ descriptions
indeed yield the components of the Springer fiber BN .



        4. STRUCTURE OF INTERSECTIONS OF TWO
              COMPONENTS OF HOOK TYPE

   Theorem 4.1. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type. Suppose we
have two standard tableaux A and B on the Young shape of N , where the
standard tableau A has top row n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 and the standard tableau B
has top row n, i′b−1 , . . . , i′1 . Then the intersection of the two components
KA ∩ KB is nonempty iff βj = max{ij , i′j } < min{ij+1 , i′j+1 } = αj+1 , in
which case KA ∩ KB is an iterated fiber bundle with
                                                        b(βj )
                  B2j−1 = Gβj −βj−1 −1 (ker Nβj / im Nβj         )
          B2j = {F ∈ F l(Fβj /Fβj−1 ) | im Njb−j−1 ∈ Fαj −βj−1 }.



  Proof.
  We proceed as in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Let αj = min{ij , i′j } and
βj = max{ij , i′j }. By superimposing the characterizations of the compo-
nents KA and KB , we deduce that the intersection KA ∩ KB is given by
those flags F in F l(V ) for which


                       im N b−1 ⊆ Fα1 ⊆ Fβ1 ⊆ ker N
                      im N b−2 ⊆ Fα2 ⊆ Fβ2 ⊆ ker N 2
                      im N b−3 ⊆ Fα3 ⊆ Fβ3 ⊆ ker N 3
                                   ...
                    im N 1 ⊆ Fαb−1 ⊆ Fβb−1 ⊆ ker N b−1 .

  If there exists j for which max{ij , i′j } ≥ min{ij+1 , i′j+1 } then the flag
Fmax{ij ,i′j } would have to contain im N b−j−1 yet be contained in ker N j ,
                   TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                              11

which is impossible by Lemma 3.3. This proves the emptiness assertion of
the lemma.
   Now we exhibit the intersection KA ∩ KB = X1 as an iterated bundle.
Define a map p1 : X1 → B1 = Gβ1 −1 (ker N/ im N b−1 ) by F 7→ Fβ1 . The
typical fiber X2 of the map p1 consists of all flags F with a fixed Fβ1 such
that Fα1 contains the 1-dimensional space im N b−1 . Then there is a map
taking X2 to the space B2 , which consists of all flags inside Fβ1 such that
Fα1 contains im N b−1 , given by F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn 7→ F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ · · · ⊂
Fβ1 . We described the structure and homology of the space B2 in lemma
3.2 above.
   Then the fiber of the map p2 : X2 → B2 is in bijection with a cer-
tain space of flags in V /Fβ1 satisfying (as in the previous theorem) a list
of conditions with respect to the quotient map Nβ1 : V /Fβ1 → V /Fβ1 .
As before, these conditions are exactly the ones that specify the intersec-
tion of two components of the Springer fiber for Nβ1 whose tableaux Aβ1
and Bβ1 have top rows n − β1 , ib−1 − β1 , . . . , i2 − β1 and n − β1 , i′b−1 −
β1 , . . . , i′2 − β1 respectively. Thus by descending induction we have our re-
sult.

  Corollary 4.1. The intersection of the two components in the above
theorem has intersection homology Poincaré polynomial equal to
                                                                                     

     [β1 − 1]              [α1 − 1]             [β2 − β1 − 1]                [α2 − β1 − 1]
                                                              
        [n − βj−1 − b + j − 1]                   [βj − βj−1 − 1]
  ...                              [βj − αj ]!                     [αj − βj−1 ]! . . .
            [βj − βj−1 − 1]                      [αj − βj−1 − 1]
                                                         
    [n − βb−2 − 2]                       [βb−1 − βb−2 − 1]
                        [βb−1 −αb−1 ]!                        [αb−1 −βb−2 ]![n−βb−1 ]!
  [βb−1 − βb−2 − 1]                     [αb−1 − βb−2 − 1]

This polynomial equals

          [n − b]![α1 ][α2 − β1 ][α3 − β2 ] . . . [αb−1 − βb−2 ][n − βb−1 ].




   5. DETERMINATION OF THE TOPOLOGY OF
COMPONENTS OF SPRINGER FIBERS FOR NILPOTENT
      MAPS OF TWO-ROW TYPE FOR GLN (C)
  In this section we study the Springer fibers of nilpotent maps N whose
Young shapes have at most two rows. Thus N has at most two Jordan
blocks. We will find that the components are iterated bundles with CP1 as
12                          FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


base spaces, and we will relate the intersection homology Poincaré polyno-
mials of their pairwise intersections to the inner products of the Kazhdan-
Lusztig basis. In doing so, we will extend some results of Lorist[21] on the
topology of the components of two-row shapes with two boxes in the lower
row.
   Let N : V → V be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Recall that a flag
F with subspaces 0 = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn = V is fixed by N if for all
i, we have N Fi ⊆ Fi−1 . Recall that b is defined to be the least positive
integer with N b = 0. Similarly let b(i) be the least positive integer such
       b(i)
that Ni = 0.
   Definition 5.1.    Suppose Ni : V /Fi → V /Fi is a quotient map of a
nilpotent map N . Suppose that the subspace Fj /Fi contains im Nik but
not im Nik−1 . Then we call im Nik the lowest image contained in Fj /Fi
and we denote this lowest image im Nik by Lowimi (Fj ). (Note that the
image of a higher power of Ni is a smaller subspace of V /Fi .) Similarly, we
denote the lowest image of N that is not contained in Fj by Lowim(Fj ).


  Lemma 5.1. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Let Fi be a
subspace of V such that Fi ⊆ im N and N Fi ⊂ Fi . Then the quotient
space N −1 (Fi )/Fi is 2-dimensional.


  Proof. Since N Fi ⊂ Fi , we see that indeed Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi ). Then the
dimensionality of N −1 (Fi )/Fi is clear from the Jordan form of the map N ,
since Fi ⊆ im N .

  Lemma 5.2. Suppose N is a nilpotent map corresponding to a two-
row Young shape τ . Let A be a standard tableau of shape τ with top
row n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 . Then every flag F in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset
SV (A) defined in 2 satisfies the following conditions: Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 ) and
im N b−j ⊆ Fij .


  Proof. Let the flag F be in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A).
Then by construction of SV (A), every subspace clearly satisfies the first
condition.
  Now we prove the second condition by inspecting the procedure used to
specify the flag subspaces of F . Recall that if i is in the c(i)-th column of
                                                c(i)−1         c(i)
A, then Fi /Fi−1 must lie in ker Ni−1 ∩ (im Ni−1 − im Ni−1 ).
  Now we show that if i is on the bottom row of A then, for any flag
F in SV (A), Lowim(Fi ) = Lowim(Fi−1 ); in other words, the subspace
Fi will never contain a lower image than Fi−1 contains. There are two
                   TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                              13

                                                                b   −1 i−1
cases. First suppose the highest non-zero image im Ni−1                    of Ni−1 is
                                                                 bi−1 −1
2- dimensional. Then Fi /Fi−1 cannot exhaust im Ni−1 . On the other
                                           bi−1 −1
hand, if the highest image im Ni−1                 is 1-dimensional, then since the
number i is not on the top row of the tableau A, the subspace Fi /Fi−1
                            bi−1 −1
must not equal im Ni−1              .
   Now note that F1 , . . . , Fi1 −1 do not contain wholly any image of N . To
stress our line of argument, note that these subspaces contain the same
image of N as F0 = {0} does. Therefore im Nib−1          1 −1
                                                              6= 0. Then by construc-
                                             b−1
tion, Fi1 /Fi1 −1 must contain im Ni1 −1 . Since Fi1 also contains Fi1 −1 , we
see by Lemma 2.2 that Fi1 must contain im N b−1 .
   Similarly, Fij , . . . , Fij+1 −1 all contain im N b−j and no lower image of N ,
because each of these subspaces is constructed not to contain the high-
est image of the previous quotient map; and, as before, Fij+1 must contain
im N b−j−1 . Thus the lemma is proved.
   Remark 5. 1. Note that the conditions of the lemma are closed and so
are satisfied by the closure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A), which
is the entire component KA of the Springer fiber BN .




  Theorem 5.1. Suppose that N is a nilpotent map of two-row type and
that A is a standard tableau on the Young shape of N , with top row n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 .
For any i between 1 and n, denote by T (i) and B(i) the lengths of the top
and bottom rows of the tableau obtained from A by deleting 1, . . . , i. Sup-
pose the flag F is contained in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Then
the subspace Fi contains im N T (i) and is contained in im N B(i) .


   Proof. The assertion about T (i) is proven above. As to the assertion
about B(i), we proceed by induction on i. First note that F1 is contained
in N −1 (F0 ) and therefore must be contained in the lowest image which has
nontrivial intersection with the kernel. By inspecting the Jordan form of
N we see that this image is exactly im N B(1) .
   Now suppose Fi is contained in im N B(i) . Then there are two possibil-
ities for Fi+1 . If i + 1 is on the bottom, then Fi+1 is within N −1 (Fi ) ⊆
N −1 (im N B(i) ). Now by the Jordan form, we see that B(i) cannot be
greater than the power of the lowest image that contains ker N , so im N B(i)
contains ker N . Thus, by lemma 2.1,


                N −1 (im N B(i) ) = im N B(i)−1 = im N B(i+1) .
14                           FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


  Now if i + 1 is on the top row of the tableau A, then by Theorem 2.1,
Fi+1 /Fi is equal to (im N T (i+1) + Fi )/Fi . Since T (i + 1) ≥ B(i), the sub-
space Fi+1 is still contained in im N B(i) .

  Theorem 5.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type, and let A
be a standard tableau on the Young shape of A with top row n, ib−1 , . . . , i1 .
Then the component KA of the Springer fiber BN consists of all flags whose
subspaces satisfy the following conditions:

                      Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 ) for each i, and

if i is on the top row of the tableau A and i − 1 is on the bottom row, then

                               Fi = N −1 (Fi−2 );

if i and i − 1 are both in the top row of A, then if Fi−1 = N −d (Fr ) where
r is on the bottom row then

                              Fi = N −d−1 (Fr−1 )

and if Fi−1 = N −d (im N b−i ) where 0 ≤ i < n − b then

                           Fi = N −d (im N b−i−1 ).

  The subspaces that are specified as inverse images of other spaces will
be called dependent; note that they are exactly the subspaces whose in-
dices are on the top row of the tableau A. The other subspaces are called
independent.


   Proof. Denote by K(A) the closed subset of flags that satisfy the con-
ditions of the theorem. Note that K(A) ⊆ BN . Let F be a flag in the
Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Then we prove by induction on i that
each subspace Fi of F satisfies the above conditions, so that the flag F lies
in K(A). Then we will show below that the closed subset of the theorem
is in fact irreducible and of the same dimension as the (nonempty) subset
SV (A). Thus K(A) is exactly the closure of the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset
SV (A) and is thus the component KA of the Springer fiber BN .
   First we settle the i = 1 case. Suppose that the number 1 is in the
bottom row of A. Then for all F in the Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A),
it is the case that F1 must be in ker N , which is exactly N −1 (F0 ). If 1 is
in the top row then F1 must equal the highest image im N b−1 ; note that
F0 = 0 = N −0 (im N b ) so F1 = N −0 (im N b−1 ). Also note that the highest
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                           15

image must indeed be 1-dimensional in order for 1 to be in the top row.
This settles the i = 1 case.
   Now suppose that F1 , . . . , Fi satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Now
the number i + 1 is either on the bottom row of the tableau A, or on the
top row of A. If i + 1 is on the bottom row of A, then the Spaltenstein-
Vargas procedure requires only that Fi+1 /Fi be contained in ker Ni , which
by lemma 2.3 equals N −1 (Fi ).
   Now suppose i + 1 is on the top row of the tableau A. Then the number
i is either on the bottom row of A or on the top row. First we will prove
that if i is on the bottom row, then Fi+1 = N −1 (Fi−1 ).
   Recall that Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 ), and Fi+1 /Fi must be the 1-dimensional
subspace of V /Fi which is the highest nonzero image of Ni . (Since i was
on the bottom row, it is clear that the tableau obtained by deleting 1, . . . , i
is not rectangular so the highest image of Ni is not 2-dimensional.)
                                   −1
   So Fi is in N −1 (Fi−1 ) = Ni−1    (0 + Fi−1 ) and by construction Fi /Fi−1
cannot be all of the highest nonzero image of Ni−1 . Therefore there must
be other vectors v ∈ N −1 (Fi−1 ) such that v + Fi 6= 0 + Fi , and also v + Fi−1
is in the highest image of Ni−1 , hence v is in the highest image of N which
is in not in Fi−1 . Then any such v must be in the highest image of N which
is not contained in Fi . Since N −1 (Fi−1 )/Fi is 1-dimensional, this proves
that N −1 (Fi−1 )/Fi must be the highest image of Ni : V /Fi → V /Fi .
   Thus we have proven that if i is in the bottom row and i + 1 is in the
top row, then Fi+1 = N −1 (Fi−1 ).
   Now suppose i + 1 is on the top row, and i is also on the top row. Then
by induction either Fi = N −d (Fr ) where r is on the bottom row, or else
Fi = N −d (im N a ) (where n − b < a ≤ b). If r is on the bottom row then,
by Theorem 5.1, the lowest image that Fr contains is exactly the same
as the lowest image that Fr−1 contains. Therefore N −1 (Fr−1 ) contains
one lower image and is of dimension exactly one larger than that of Fr .
Thus N −d−1 (Fr−1 ) contains exactly one lower image and is of one larger
dimension than N −d (Fr ).
   Otherwise Fi = N −d (im N a ) for some a > n − b. Since a > n − b,
the dimension of im N a−1 is exactly one larger than the dimension of
im N a . Thus N −d (im N a−1 ) contains one lower image and is one dimen-
sion larger than im N a . So N −d (im N a−1 )/Fi equals the highest nonzero
              b(i)
image im Ni and so Fi+1 = N −d (im N a−1 ). Finally, we prove below that
K(A) = SV (A) = KA .

  Proposition 5.1. The closed subset K(A) is irreducible, and K(A) is
an iterated bundle of base type (CP1 , . . . , CP1 , where there are as many
terms as there are number in the bottom row of the tableau A.

   Proof. Suppose that the shape of N has exactly two rows (if it has
only one row, then KA is a point). Let F be a flag in the component
KA of the Springer fiber BN . Suppose Fj1 is the smallest independent
subspace of the flag F . Then Fj1 −1 is some fixed subspace of V (nec-
essarily in im N ), and Fj1 /Fj1 −1 can be any point in the fixed space
P(N −1 (Fj1 −1 )/Fj1 −1 ) = CP1 . Set B1 = N −1 (Fj1 −1 )/Fj1 −1 . The map
p1 : KA → B1 given by F 7→ Fj1 /Fj1 −1 is then a fiber bundle (it is clearly
a proper submersion). The typical fiber X2 of the map p1 consists of all
flags F in KA with the subspace Fi fixed, as well as with all subspaces
of F that are dependent on Fj1 fixed. Now find the smallest independent
subspace Fj2 in X2 . Again, all subspaces smaller then Fj2 are dependent,
and thus fixed. So we see that Fj2 /Fj2 −1 can be any point in the fixed
space P(N −1 (Fj2 −1 )/Fj2 −1 ) = B2 , which defines the bundle projection
p2 : X2 → B2 , with fiber X3 . We continue until all independent subspaces
are exhausted and the fiber consists of one flag with all subspaces fixed.

  Theorem 5.3. Every component KA of the Springer fiber for a nilpotent
map of two-row type is an iterated bundle of base type (CP1 , . . . , CP1 , where
there are as many terms as there are numbers in the bottom row of the
tableau A.


   Proof. The closed subset K(A) is irreducible, contained in BN , and
clearly has dimension n − b, which is the dimension of the nonempty
Spaltenstein-Vargas subset SV (A). Therefore, by standard algebraic geom-
etry, K(A) must equal the component KA = SV (A).

                                     3 2

Then the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi ⊂
N −1 (Fi−1 ), and the conditions F1 = imN 2 and F4 = N −1 (F2 ), which we
can write compactly as

                     im N 2 ⊂ F2 ⊂ F3 ⊂ N −1 (F2 ) ⊂ V.

Similarly, the standard tableau

corresponds to the component

                  F1 ⊂ N −1 (F0 ) ⊂ N −1 (im N 2 ) ⊂ F4 ⊂ V.

                                    2 1

Then the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi ⊂
N −1 (Fi−1 ) and

                                    3 2

corresponds to the component with Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 ) and

                    im N 2 ⊂ F2 ⊂ F3 ⊂ N −1 (F2 ) ⊂ V.

  Their intersection is the set of flags with Fi ⊂ N −1 (Fi−1 ) and

            im N 2 < N −1 (F0 ) < N −1 (im N 2 ) < N −2 (F0 ) < V.

In particular, the intersection is not empty, in contrast to the assertions of
Wolper[30].

                               6 5 2 1

Then the corresponding component of BN is the set of flags with Fi ⊂

  F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ N −1 (F1 ) ⊂ N −2 (F0 ) ⊂ F5 ⊂ F6 ⊂
                               N −1 (F5 ) ⊂ N −4 (F0 ) ⊂ N −4 (im N 5 ) ⊂ V.



   Example 5.4.     We show how to recover Lorist’s description of the
structure of components of Springer fibers of 2-regular nilpotent maps (that
18                           FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


is, those nilpotent maps N whose Young shapes have two boxes in the
second row). There are two types of components KA , corresponding to
whether the numbers on the bottom row of A are consecutive (yielding a
non-trivial bundle) or not consecutive (yielding a trivial bundle). If the
numbers in the bottom rows A are not consecutive, say i < j, then we get

     im N b−1 ⊂ im N b−2 ⊂ im N b−i+1 ⊂ Fi ⊂ N −1 (im N b−i+1 ) ⊂ . . .
⊂ N −1 (im N b−j+3 ) ⊂ Fj ⊂ N −2 (im N b−j+3 ) ⊂ N −2 (im N b−j+2 ) ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn .

  If the numbers are consecutive, say i, i + 1, then we get

im N b−1 ⊂ im N b−2 ⊂ im N b−i+1 ⊂ Fi ⊂ Fi+1 ⊂ N −1 (Fi ) ⊂ N −2 (im N b−i+1 ) ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn .



  Finally, we derive the scholium that the “dependence” on one subspace
on another can be thought of as symmetric: if Fi = N −d (Fr ) in the above
theorem, then indeed Fi also determines Fr ; so given either subspace, we
can obtain the other. So “independent” can be thought of as “smallest in
the chain of dependencies.”
  Proposition 5.2. Suppose Fi is specified as N −d (Fr ) in Theorem 5.2.
Then the map N d : Fi → Fr is surjective. Thus the subspace Fi determines
the subspace Fr .


   Proof. In general, N (N −1 (W )) = W ∩ im N . Thus we need only ensure
that if Fi is specified as N −d (Fr ) then in fact Fr ⊆ im N d . First note that
the process described in the proof of Theorem 5.2 never takes an inverse
image of a subspace Fi unless Fi ⊂ im N . Furthermore, if Fi = N −d (Fr )
where Fr is independent and r > 0, then (for F in SV (A)) the subspace
Fr−1 is contained in one higher image of N than Fr . So if N −d+1 (Fr ) ⊂
im N k , then also N −d (Fr−1 ) ⊂ im N k . This last statement holds in the en-
tire component KA . Hence if Fi = N −d (Fr ) then Fr ⊆ im N d , so N d (Fi ) =
Fr .


  6. RELATIONSHIP WITH KAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY
   Let W be a Coxeter group with simple reflections S. Denote the Chevalley-
Bruhat order by <. Recall [18][16] that the Kazhdan-Lusztig construction
                     ′
yields elements Cw     in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W , which give dis-
tinguished bases for certain representations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra,
called left cell representations, which are associated to certain subsets C of
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                          19

W called left cells. In particular, this construction yields a distinguished
basis for each irreducible representation of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn
of the symmetric group Sn .
   Now recall [7][22] that every irreducible representation M of the Iwahori-
Hecke algebra Hn possesses a unique (up to a scalar) nondegenerate sym-
metric bilinear form h , i that is invariant under Hn , in the sense that
for any v, v ′ ∈ M , we have hTw v, v ′ i = hv, Tw∗ v ′ i. (Here, the involution
∗
  : Hn → Hn is defined by sending Tw 7→ Tw−1 and then extending lin-
early.)
   Thus we can consider the inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis
vectors of an irreducible representation with respect to this inner product.
We find that they satisfy equations very reminiscent of a possible appli-
cation of the Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber Decomposition Theorem.
To state these relations, first we determine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the elements Cs′ (for s a simple reflection) acting by left multiplication
on Hn .
   Lemma 6.1. The eigenvectors of the map Hn → Hn given by left multi-
plication by Cs′ are given by

                 cw                    where sw < w, and
                 Cs′ Cw
                      ′
                        − (t + t−1 )Cw
                                     ′
                                       where sw > w.


  Proof. The first follows immediately from the formula for Cs′ Cw
                                                                 ′
                                                                   (see
[26]). To see the second, we calculate

                       Cs′ Cs′ Cw
                                ′
                                  − (t + t−1 )Cs′ Cw
                                                   ′
                                                     = 0.

Now note that these eigenvectors span the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn .

  Lemma 6.2. The eigenvectors for Cs′ on a left cell representation MC
are
                    ′
                  Cw                    where sw < w, and
                  Cs′ cw − (t + t−1 )cw where sw > w.


  Proof. Immediate from Lemma 6.1.
  Our equations follow from the following
  Lemma 6.3. Let V be a representation of an algebra A. Suppose V is
equipped with an invariant symmetric bilinear form h , i. Suppose we have
20                            FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


an element a ∈ A with a = a∗ , and let x and y be eigenvectors of a with
different eigenvalues. Then x and y are orthogonal; i.e. hx, yi = 0.


 Proof. Suppose x has eigenvalue λ and y has eigenvalue ρ under a ∈ A.
Then hax, yi = λhx, yi = hx, ayi = ρhx, yi so if λ 6= ρ then hx, yi = 0.

  Theorem 6.1. Let C be a left cell yielding a left cell representation MC .
Let h , i be an invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on MC .
Let s be a simple reflection for W . Then for each pair (x, w) with s ∈ L(x)
and s 6∈ L(w) (so s descends x but not w), we have an equation between
inner products

                        (t + t−1 )hcx , cw i = hcx , Cs′ cw i.



   Proof. Given a simple reflection s, we have a large supply of eigenvectors
for Cs′ in MC given by Lemma 6.2, namely cx where sx < x and (t+t−1 )cw −
Cs′ cw where sw > w. Then for each pair (x, w), we have two eigenvectors of
Cs′ with different eigenvalues, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal. Therefore
we have the equations as claimed.
  In fact, these equations are equivalent to Hn -invariance:

  Proposition 6.1. If a bilinear form on a left cell representation satisfies
the equations

                        (t + t−1 )hcx , cw i = hcx , Cs′ cw i

for each pair cx , cw where sw > w and sx < x, then the inner product is
invariant under the action of Cs′ .


   Proof. The inner product of any two vectors can be expressed as a
linear combination of inner products of basis vectors, so we are reduced to
proving hCs′ cx , cw i = hcx , Cs′ cw i for each pair (x, w).
   There are three cases. If both cx and cw are descended by s, then clearly

                    h(t + t−1 )cx , cw i = hcx , (t + t−1 )cw i.

  If cx is descended by s but cw is not, then by the equations above

                hCs′ cx , cw i = h(t + t−1 )cx , cw i = hcx , Cs′ cw i.
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                                21

                                                                    ′
  Finally suppose neither
                      P basis vector in hcx , cw i is descended by Cs . Then,
                ′
recalling that Cs cx = y≃L x µ(x, y)cy , we have
                            sy<y


            (t + t−1 )hCs′ cx , cw i = hCs′ Cs′ cx , cw i = hCs′ cx , Cs′ cw i,

since each term in Cs′ cx is descended by s. Then by a symmetric argument

            hCs′ cx , Cs′ cw i = hcx , Cs′ Cs′ cw i = (t + t−1 )hcx , Cs′ cw i.

This completes the proof.
   The form of these equations is very similar to the conclusion of the
Decomposition Theorem [1][4]. This analogy suggests an interpretation
in terms of Poincaré polynomials: hcx , cw i as the intersection homology
Poincareé polynomial of the intersection of two spaces KA and KB , (t+t−1 )
as a CP1 , the left side as a CP1 bundle over KA ∩ KB , and the right side
as terms from the Decomposition Theorem, applied to some map from the
total space of the bundle to some space.
   Thus, given a W -graph for a left cell representation, we can write down
a set of equations that the Gram matrix entries of an Hn -invariant inner
product must satisfy, and which determine them up to a common scalar.
If we can prove that the Poincaré polynomials of some collection of spaces
satisfy those equations, and we can calculate the Poincaré polynomial of
one of the spaces, then we can calculate the Poincaré polynomials of all the
spaces in the collection. We will now do this for Springer fibers of hook
and two-row type, where the W -graphs are known explicitly.
   The W -graphs for left cells with hook shapes are very easily determined
because no two standard tableaux have the same descent set. (See Garsia-
McLarnan[9], Fact 14, or Curtis-Iwahori- Kilmoyer[6].) Since all left cell
representations of Hn for a given Young shape are isomorphic([18], Theo-
rem 1.4), we can label the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors by their tableaux.
  Definition 6.1.     A standard tableau of hook shape B is adjacent to
the standard tableau A via k if B can be obtained from A by exchanging
k with either k + 1 or k − 1 in the tableau A. Note that exactly one of A
and B will have k as a descent.

   Note that for each standard tableau A and number k, there are at most
two standard tableaux adjacent to A. We denote by (k − 1 k)A the tableau
obtained by switching k and k − 1 in A; similarly, (k k + 1)A is the tableau
obtained from A by switching k and k + 1.
   Therefore, in the case of hook shapes, we can explicitly exhibit the set
of equations that the inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors
22                               FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


must satisfy. Using the above description of the Poincaré polynomials of
the intersection homology of the components of the Springer fibers and
their intersections, we will show that the intersection homology Poincaré
polynomials of the intersections of the components satisfy the same equa-
tions. Since the equations determine the inner product up to a scalar by
Proposition 6.1, we will be able to show that the inner product matrix of
the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors computes the intersection homology of
the Springer fibers for hook shapes.
  Theorem 6.2. Suppose A is a hook shape tableau with top row n, ib−1 , . . . , k, . . . , i1 ,
so that the number k is not a descent of the tableau A. Then the Kazhdan-
Lusztig basis vector cA transforms as


                 T(k   k+1) cA   = −cA + tc(k      k−1)A   + tc(k   k+1)A .

If (k k + 1)A or (k − 1 k)A is not standard, then omit the corresponding
term in the formula above.
   If B is a standard tableau that does not have k in the top row then

                                  T(k   k+1) cB   = t2 c B .



   Proof.
   Given two different Young tableaux A and A′ of hook type, there ex-
ists a simple reflection that descends A but not A′ , and a different sim-
ple reflection that descends A′ but not A, because their first columns
are distinct. Given a left cell C of hook type, there is a W -graph for
the left cell representation, indexed by elements of C. By ([16], Propo-
sition 7.15), the only edges in the W -graph are those that connect ele-
ments of the form x and sx, with s a simple reflection. So in partic-
ular the only possible W -graph neighbors to A with k as a descent are
(k − 1 k)A and (k k + 1)A. Depending on which of k − 1, k + 1 can be
interchanged with k in the tableau A, we arrive at the above possibilities.

  Lemma 6.4. Given the above tableaux A, B the following are eigenvec-
                        ′
tors for the action of C(k k+1) :


           (t + t−1 )cA − c(k     k−1)A   − c(k    k+1)A   with eigenvalue 0
                           cB with eigenvalue (t + t−1 )

If (k k + 1)A or (k − 1 k)A is not standard, then omit the corresponding
term in the formula above.
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                        23



   Proof.    This is immediate from Lemma 6.2 and the multiplication for-
mula above.

  Theorem 6.3. Suppose we are given a nilpotent map N on V with a
Young shape τ of hook type. Let T OP be the standard tableau on the shape
τ with top row n, b − 1, b − 2, . . . , 1. Normalize the inner products of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors so that the norm hcT OP , cT OP i has the in-
tersection homology Poincaré polynomial of the Springer fiber component
KT OP . Then the inner product hcA , cB i is equal to the intersection homol-
ogy Poincaré polynomial of the intersection KA ∩ KB .

  To accomplish this, we define maps between certain spaces, from which
the Decomposition Theorem asserts that these intersection homology Poincaré
polynomials satisfy the equations of the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products.
We need some geometric preliminaries.
   Definition 6.2. A subvariety X of the flag manifold F l(V ) is a union
of lines of type k if whenever X contains a flag F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fk−1 ⊂ Fk ⊂
Fk+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn , then X contains all flags of the form F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fk−1 ⊂
Fk′ ⊂ Fk+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn where Fk′ is between the given subspaces Fk−1 and
Fk+1 . We will, by analogy with Weyl groups, also say that k is a descent
of X. Some authors say that X is k-vertical.


  Definition 6.3. Let X be a subvariety of the flag manifold of GLn (C)
and 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. We will denote by CP1 ⋆ X the variety of pairs

         {(Fk′ , F ) where F ∈ X and Fk′ lies between Fk−1 and Fk+1 }.


    This variety admits a map φ : CP1 ⋆ X → F l(V ) given by mapping
        to the flag F ′ = F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fk−1 ⊂ Fk′ ⊂ Fk+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fn .
(Fk′ , F )
   Definition 6.4.      The image φ(CP1 ⋆ X) ⊆ F l(V ) is called the k-
saturation of X; this image is denoted Sk (X).
   So the k-saturation Sk (X) is obtained roughly by taking all flags in X
and allowing Fk to vary freely within them. Note that φ−1 (F ) is a CP1
exactly when F is contained in a line of type k in X.

   Lemma 6.5. The space CP1 ⋆ X is a locally trivial fiber bundle over X
with fiber CP1 via the obvious map (Fk′ , F ) 7→ F .
24                                FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


  Proof. This is clear.
  Remark 6. 1. We can also rephrase this using a minimal parabolic
subgroup Pk corresponding to the simple reflection (k k + 1). Then the
map π : G/B → G/Pk forgets about Fk , so the preimage π −1 (π(X)) is
equal to φ(CP1 ⋆ X).

    Suppose we have two standard tableaux A with top row n, ib−1 , . . . , k =
ij , . . . , i1 and B with top row n, i′b−1 , . . . , k̂, . . . , i′1 (that is, k is in the jth
position from the right in A, but is not in the top row in B). Then k
is a descent of the component KB but not of the component KA . Let
the position of k in the top row of A be ij . Then we have the adjacent
components K(k k−1)A and K(k k+1)A of the Springer fiber BN that have k
as a descent. Then we shall show that the intersection homology Poincaré
polynomial of the k-saturation of the intersection KB ∩ KA equals the sum
of the intersection homology Poincaré polynomials of KB ∩ K(k k−1)A and
KB ∩ K(k k+1)A , and we shall show how this equality can be interpreted in
terms of the Decomposition Theorem.
  Theorem 6.4. Let N be a nilpotent map of hook type. Let A and B be
two standard tableau on the Young shape of N such that k is a descent of
B but not of A. Then the intersection KA ∩ KB of the two components KA
and KB of the Springer fiber BN is not k-saturated. Then the map φ from
CP1 ⋆ (KB ∩ KA ) to the k- saturation Sk (KB ∩ KA ) yields an equation of
intersection homology Poincaré polynomials

  IP (CP1 ⋆ (KB ∩ KA )) = IP (K(k            k+1)A   ∩ KB ) + IP (K(k−1       k)A   ∩ KB ).

Remember that the intersection homology Poincaré polynomial IP is nor-
malized so that the sum is centered around the degree 0 term.
  If either (k − 1 k)A or (k k + 1)A is not standard, then omit the corre-
sponding term in the above. If both are not standard then the intersection
KB ∩ KA is empty.


  Proof. Suppose that we have the intersection KA ∩ KB of two compo-
nents KA and KB where k is a descent of B but not of A. Let k = ij in A.
First, if neither (k − 1 k)A or (k k + 1)A is standard, then we can check
by Theorem 4.1 that the intersection KA ∩ KB is empty. In fact, suppose
KA ∩ KB is nonempty. Then if A has top row ij+1 = k + 1, ij = k and
ij−1 = k − 1, then βj−1 = k − 1 and αj+1 = k + 1. Then in the tableau
B, the entry i′j must satisfy k − 1 < i′j < k + 1, but i′j 6= k because k is a
descent of B, which is a contradiction.
  Suppose first that (k k + 1)A is standard. Then ij = k, ij−1 < k − 1
and ij+1 > k + 1. Now the term i′j in B must satisfy either i′j > k or
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                          25

i′j < k. Suppose now that i′j > k (which is only possible when (k k + 1)A
is standard), so that k = αj and i′j = βj . Then for any F ∈ KA ∩ KB , the
subspaces of F satisfy


                im N b−j ⊂ Fk ⊂ Fk+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fi′j ⊂ ker N j

    Note that KA ∩ KB has a (Zariski) open subset of flags with im N b−j ⊂
Fk but im N b−j 6⊂ Fk−1 . In such flags, Fk is determined by Fk−1 (and
im N b−j ), so the intersection KA ∩ KB is not a union of lines of type k.
    So the k-saturation of the intersection KA ∩ KB consists of all flags
· · · Fk−1 ⊂ Fk′ ⊂ Fk+1 · · · , where Fk′ is any subspace between Fk−1 and
Fk+1 . In particular, Fk′ no longer need contain im N b−j . However, the sub-
space Fk+1 must still contain im N b−j in all of the resulting flags. Therefore
the k-saturation of KB ∩ KA is all flags with

                      im N b−j ⊆ Fk+1 ⊂ Fij ⊆ ker N j ,

and all the other conditions unaffected. Therefore the k-saturation Sk (KA ∩
KB ) is indeed K(k k+1)A ∩ KB .
  If (k − 1 k)A is also standard, then there will be a nonempty subset of
KB ∩ KA consisting of those flags in the intersection for which

                      im N b−j ⊂ Fk−1 ⊂ Fij ⊂ ker N j

which clearly corresponds to the intersection KB ∩K(k−1 k)A ; this subset is
a union of lines of type k. The subvariety KB ∩K(k−1 k)A is of codimension
2 in KB ∩ K(k k+1)A .
   Therefore we have a map φ : CP1 ⋆ (KB ∩ KA ) → K(k k+1)A ∩ KB . This
map is generically 1 − 1. The map φ is a semismall resolution, because
the subvariety where φ has a CP1 fiber is exactly K(k−1 k)A ∩ KB , which
is of codimension 2 in the image space K(k k+1)A ∩ KB , and the domain is
nonsingular.
   Therefore when we invoke the Decomposition Theorem for semismall
maps [3][4], we find that the intersection homology Poincaré polynomial
IP (CP1 ⋆ (KB ∩ KA )) equals the intersection homology Poincaré polyno-
mial IP (K(k k+1)A ∩ KB ) of the range, plus the intersection homology
IP (K(k−1 k)A ∩ KB ) of the smaller intersection. (Remember that the in-
tersection homology Poincaré polynomial IP is normalized so that all of
these sums will be centered around 0.)
   If (k k+1)A is standard but (k−1 k) is not, then K(k−1 k)A ∩KB is empty,
so its term is omitted. Finally, if i′j < k so k = βj (which is only possible if
(k−1 k)A is standard), then the roles of K(k−1 k)A and K(k k+1)A will be re-
versed in the above argument.

(where we denote the space KA by its tableau A):

  For the first intersection, we have

                α1 = 1, β1 = 2, α2 = 3, β2 = 3, α3 = 5, β3 = 6

so the computation of the polynomials is

  [2] × [1][7 − 4]![3 − 2][5 − 3][7 − 6]
         = [1][7 − 4]![3 − 2][6 − 3][7 − 6] + [1][7 − 4]![3 − 2][4 − 3][7 − 6].




 7. STRUCTURE OF INTERSECTIONS OF COMPONENTS
  OF TWO-ROW TYPE AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH
           KAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY
   Now we compute the intersection homology Poincarè polynomials of pair-
wise intersections of components and then relate them to Kazhdan-Lusztig
theory. In doing so, we also correct a result of Wolper[30].
   Let N be a nilpotent map with a two-row Young shape τ . In this sec-
tion we prove that the intersection homology Poincaré polynomials of the
intersections of the components of the Springer fiber BN coincide with the
(appropriately normalized) inner products of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis
vectors of the left cell representation of Hn associated to the Young shape
τ.
   The Kazhdan-Lusztig inner product matrix has been studied for left cell
representations of two- row type because they yield the representations of
the so-called Temperley-Lieb algebra[29]. We shall understand how the
combinatorics of the Temperley-Lieb algebra representations encodes the
structure of the intersections of components of the Springer fiber.
   First, let us review some notions from Temperley-Lieb theory[29].
                 TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                          27

   Definition 7.1. Suppose we have the numbers 1 to n on a horizontal
line, increasing to the right. Then an (n, p)-cup diagram consists of p
cups on these numbers, where each cup connects two numbers, no two
cups intersect each other, and no number is underneath a cup and yet not
connected to any cup. The entire cup diagram must lie in one half- plane.


  Lemma 7.1. Suppose τ is a Young shape with n boxes and n − b boxes in
the second row. Then there is a bijection between standard Young tableaux
on τ and (n, n− b)-cup diagrams. This bijection is denoted A → CupD(A).


   Proof. Let A be a standard tableau of shape τ . We construct a cup
diagram as follows. Begin at the number 1 on the horizontal line. Proceed
from left to right, starting a cup at i if the number i is on the bottom row of
A, and ending a cup if i is on the top row by matching the number i with the
closest started cup that can be matched with i. All unpaired ends of cups
are then left blank (these are called orphaned numbers). It is easily seen
that this procedure produces a bijection between cup diagrams and two-row
tableaux.
  Example 7.1.      The (7, 3) cup diagram




            1        2        3        4      5        6        7

  corresponds to the standard Young tableau

                                  6 2 1


   Lemma 7.2. A two-row standard tableau A has a descent at i if and only
if the associated cup diagram CupD(A) has a cup connecting i and i + 1.
Such a cup will be called a minimal cup.


  Proof. The tableau A has a descent exactly when i is on the bottom
row and i + 1 is on the top row. This is the case exactly when there is
cup connecting the numbers i and i + 1 in the cup diagram CupD(A).
28                          FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


   We shall exhibit a correspondence between the cup diagram CupD(A)
and the dependencies among the subspaces of the flags in the component
KA . First, let us extend the cup diagram CupD(A) by adding the numbers
0, −1, . . . , −(n − b) to the left of the numbers 1, . . . , n. Now match each
orphaned number in the cup diagram, working from left to right, to the
closest possible negative number. This creates an extended cup diagram
that we label ECupD(A). Note that there are no additional choices here
so these extended cup diagrams are still in bijection with the standard
tableaux. For a point i which is an endpoint of a cup, denote by σ(i) the
other endpoint of the cup.
  Definition 7.2.     Given a cup diagram CupD(A) and an index i at
which a cup begins or ends, we denote by CupA (i) the cup that begins or
ends at i.

   Recall that a subspace Fi in a component KA is called dependent if F
is specified by Theorem 5.2 as the inverse image of some smaller subspace
(equivalently, the number i is on the top row of A), and is said to depend
on that smaller space. Otherwise the subspace is called independent.
  Remark 7. 1. For −(n − b) ≤ i < 0, we interpret Fi to mean im N b−i .


   Definition 7.3. A cup Cup1 lies directly beneath a cup Cup2 if Cup1
is beneath Cup2 and there are no other cups that lie both above Cup1 and
below Cup2 .


  Theorem 7.1. Consider a nilpotent map N and a two-row standard
tableau A on the Young shape of N . Then the extended cup diagram
ECupD(A) encodes the dependencies among the subspaces of the flags in
KA as follows. If a cup begins at i, then Fi is independent. If a cup ends
at i then Fi is an inverse image of Fσ(i)−1 (interpreted using convention
7.1).


   Proof. Let i > 0. First, note that Fi is independent iff the number i
is on the bottom row of the tableau A. This is true iff i starts a cup in
ECupD(A). The subspace Fi is dependent on a smaller subspace iff i ends
a cup in ECupD(A).
   Now suppose Fi is dependent. We apply the characterization of Theorem
5.2. Let us proceed by induction on the length |σ(i)−i| of the cup CupA (i).
If i − 1 is independent, then Fi is equal to N −1 (Fi−2 ). On the other hand,
i − 1 starts a cup and i ends the cup, so there must be a minimal cup
                  TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                           29

connecting i − 1 and i, and so i − 2 = σ(i) − 1. This proves the |σ(i) − i| = 1
case.
   Now suppose that i is dependent and i − 1 is also dependent. Then,
since cups cannot cross, we see that σ(i) < σ(i − 1), so that the cup
CupA (i − 1) is shorter than the cup CupA (i). Now note that all numbers
under the cup CupA (i) must either begin or end a cup. So if σ(i − 1) 6=
σ(i) + 1, then there must exist a sequence of adjacent cups directly be-
neath CupA (i) beginning at σ(i) + 1 and ending at σ(i − 1) − 1. Then
by induction, the space Fi−1 depends on the independent subspace Fσ(i) ,
so by Theorem 5.2 the subspace Fi depends on the subspace Fσ(i)−1 .

   Proposition 7.1. Suppose i > 0 begins a cup in CupD(A). If a sub-
space Fj depends on the (independent) subspace Fi , then i < j < σ(i); that
is, j lies strictly under the cup that begins at i. In fact, if j is the end of a
cup that lies directly beneath CupA (i) then Fj depends in Fi .


   Proof. Note first that j > i since Fj is to depend on the independent
subspace Fi . Recall that since Fj is dependent, j ends a cup, and Fj
depends on the subspace Fσ(j)−1 . Either that subspace is independent, or
σ(j) − 1 ends another cup so Fσ(j)−1 depends on σ(σ(j) − 1) − 1, and so
forth.
   If j > i and j does not lie strictly under the cup starting at i then either
σ(j) < i or σ(j) > σ(i) so σ(j) − 1 cannot lie strictly under the cup either.
If σ(j) − 1 = σ(i) then Fj depends on Fi−1 and thus not on Fi . So, Fσ(j)−1
cannot depend on Fi unless i < j < σ(i).
   As to the last assertion, note that if j ends a cup lying directly beneath
CupA (i), then Fj must depend on Fσ(j)−1 . Then σ(j) − 1 must also end
a cup lying directly beneath CupA (i) unless σ(j)−1 = i. This completes the
proof.
   Now we demonstrate that the intersections of components of the Springer
fiber BN satisfy the equations for the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products.
Suppose A is a standard tableau on the shape of N . Suppose i is not a
descent of A (so it is not the case that i is on the bottom row and i + 1 is
on top). The assertion that i is not a descent is equivalent to the assertion
that there is not a cup joining i and i + 1. Then, we can manufacture a
cup diagram having i as a descent.
   Definition 7.4.    Suppose CupD(A) is a cup diagram that does not
have a minimal cup connecting i and i + 1. Suppose σ(i) 6= i and σ(i + 1) 6=
i + 1. Then the cup diagram CupD(ui A) is defined by deleting the cups
with endpoints at i and i + 1, then connecting i and i + 1 with a minimal
cup and connecting σ(i) to σ(i + 1) with another cup. If exactly one of
30                          FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


σ(i) = i or σ(i + 1) = i + 1, then we only insert the cup between i and i + 1.
If both σ(i) = i and σ(i + 1) = i + 1 then CupD(ui A) does not exist. Note
that this definition also defines a standard tableau ui A.

  In Westbury[29] it is proven that the tableau ui A gives the unique W -
graph neighbor to A that has i as a descent; if this tableau ui A does not
exist, then there are no neighbors to A in the W -graph with i as a descent.
We now show that if we i-saturate the intersection KA ∩ KB (where KB is
descended by i) then we get the intersection Kui A ∩ KB .
   Theorem 7.2. Let N be a nilpotent map of two-row type. Consider two
standard tableaux A and B on the Young shape of N such that i descends
B but not A. Suppose ui A is the unique W -graph neighbor to A that has i
as a descent. Then the intersection homology Poincaré polynomials of the
intersections satisfy the following equality:

                (t + t−1 )IP (KA ∩ KB ) = IP (Kui A ∩ KB ).

If there is no such neighbor ui A then the intersection KA ∩ KB is empty.


  Proof. We shall show that the i-saturation CP1 ⋆ (KA ∩ KB ) of the
intersection KA ∩KB has Fi independent, but all other dependencies among
the other subspaces are the same as in KA ∩ KB . This will prove the
theorem. We use the fact that if Fj depends on Fi , then we can also
determine Fi from knowledge of Fj (Proposition 5.2).
  There are several cases; first note that in all cases, Fi+1 = N −1 (Fi−1 )
because this dependency holds in KB .
  1. Suppose σ(i + 1) < σ(i) < i < i + 1 in A. First, for a flag F in the
component KA , we see that Fi+1 depends on Fσ(i+1)−1 . Because Fi+1 =
N −1 (Fi−1 ) in KB , we see that Fi+1 must depend on Fi−1 . Now in the
component KA , the number i − 1 is either equal to σ(i), or i − 1 lies at the
end of a cup lying directly under CupA (i). So the subspace Fi−1 depends
on the subspace for the start of the cup CupA (i), namely Fσ(i) . Thus Fi+1
depends on Fσ(i) . Since Fi+1 depends on Fσ(i+1)−1 in KA , we see that
Fσ(i) must depend on Fσ(i+1)−1 in the intersection KA ∩ KB .
Then in the transformed tableau ui A, we now have a cup connecting
σ(i + 1) to σ(i) and one connecting i to i + 1. This means that for any flag
F in the component Kui A , Fσ(i) is dependent on Fσ(i+1)−1 . Thus the inter-
section Kui A ∩ KB will have all the same dependencies between subspaces
as KA ∩ KB does, except that Kui A ∩ KB will be i-saturated.
  2. Suppose σ(i) < i < i + 1 < σ(i + 1). Then in KA , the subspace Fi
depends on Fσ(i)−1 , and Fσ(i+1) depends on Fi and thus on Fσ(i)−1 .
                 TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                          31

Now for any flag F in Kui A , the subspace Fσ(i+1) depends on Fσ(i)−1 as
well. No dependency is imposed on Fi+1 that was not present in KA ∩ KB .


   3. Suppose i < i + 1 < σ(i + 1) < σ(i). Then for any flag F in the
component KA , the subspace Fσ(i) depends on Fi−1 , and the subspace
Fσ(i+1) depends on Fi . Also σ(i + 1) − 1 is either i + 1 or is the end
of a cup directly under CupA (i + 1). So, by Proposition 7.1, the subspace
Fσ(i+1)−1 depends on Fi+1 . Thus in the intersection KA ∩KB , the subspace
Fσ(i+1)−1 depends on Fi−1 .


Then in Kui A , we have that Fσ(i) depends on Fσ(i+1)−1 . By the same chain
of dependencies, Fσ(i+1)−1 depends on Fi+1 and thus on Fi−1 , so Fσ(i+1)−1
depends on Fi−1 . Finally, the subspace Fσ(i+1) (which in KA depended on
Fi ) does not depend in Kui A on Fi .


  4. Note that the above two arguments are identical if exactly one of σ(i)
and σ(i + 1) is negative.


   5. Finally, if both σ(i) and σ(i + 1) are negative, then in the original
cup diagram CupD(A), both i and i + 1 are orphans. This is exactly the
case where there is no W -graph neighbor to A having i as a descent (see
Westbury[29]). So we show that the intersection KA ∩ KB has to be empty.
In the component KB where i is a descent, Fi+1 = N −1 (Fi−1 ) and so Fi+1
is chosen to contain exactly one lower image than Fi−1 as well as Fi .


On the other hand, consider a flag F in the component KA where i is not
a descent. In the original cup diagram CupD(A), both i and i + 1 are
orphans. Therefore Fi−1 is also dependent (otherwise i − 1 would have to
connect to i). So Fi is chosen to contain exactly one lower image than
Fi−1 , and in fact Fi = N −k (im N j ) for some j, k. Then Fi+1 is chosen to
contain exactly one lower image than Fi and in fact Fi = N −k (im N j−1 ).
Thus, in KA , the subspace Fi+1 must contain two lower images than Fi−1 .
But in KB , the subspace Fi+1 must contain exactly one lower image then
Fi−1 . Therefore there are no flags in the intersection KA ∩ KB .


   The following diagram illustrates the possibilities; in each case, the rele-
vant subdiagrams of the cup diagrams CupD(A) and CupD(ui A) are on the
top left and top right respectively. The relevant subdiagram of CupD(B)
is on the bottom in all cases.

                     σ (i) = i         i+1=σ (i+1)

                 Now we have demonstrated in all cases that the i-saturation of KA ∩ KB
              is indeed equal to Kui A ∩KB . Since KA is not a union of lines of type i, the
              conclusion of Theorem 5.2 ensures that KA has no subvariety that consists
              of lines of type i. Thus the Decomposition Theorem yields the conclusion of
              the theorem.
               As a complement, we describe the computation of the inner product
              matrix of the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis for a two-row shape.


                 Theorem 7.3. (Westbury[29], Graham-Lehrer[13]) Let τ be a two-row
              Young shape, and let A and B be two standard tableaux on the shape of τ .
              Consider the diagram formed by placing the cup diagram CupD(A) above
              the horizontal line, and CupD(B) below. Suppose the diagram contains r
              closed loops, and also that the endpoints of each open arc are pointing in
              opposite directions. Then the inner product of two Kazhdan-Lusztig basis
              vectors cA and cB is hcA , cB i = (t + t−1 )r . If an open arc in the diagram
              has both ends pointing in the same direction, then the inner product is 0.
                 TOPOLOGY OF SOME SPRINGER FIBERS                          33

  Proof. See Westbury[29], Sections 5 and 7, and Graham-Lehrer[13],
Section 6. Note that their answer differs from ours by a sign because
they use the other Kazhdan-Lusztig basis arising from the elements Cw .

   Conjecture 7.1. Based on the strong evidence of the above calculations,
we conjecture that the pairwise intersections of components of Springer
fibers of two-row type are also iterated CP1 bundles. It would suffice to
show that each pairwise intersection admits a description of the same form
as Theorem 5.2. Of course, Theorem 5.2 shows that the intersection of
two components consists of all flags that satisfy the descriptions of both
components simultaneously. So it remains to show that there is a single
description of the same form for the intersection.




                   8. FURTHER SPECULATIONS
   Much research into the relation between the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis and
the Springer fibers for GLn (C) has been stimulated by the conjecture in
Kazhdan-Lusztig[18] 6.3, which states that with the tableau labelings of
the Springer fiber components and the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis vectors, the
codimension 1 intersections of the components yield the edges of the left
cell W -graphs. It was also conceivable that the Springer basis and the
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis were the same at the level of Sn , and that perhaps
there was a way to get an Iwahori-Hecke algebra action on the Springer
basis[25].
   Recent work of Kashiwara-Saito[17] disproved a conjecture concerning
irreducibility of a certain characteristic variety, which implies that the
Springer and Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are indeed different at the Sn level,
and disproves conjecture 6.3 in general.
   For hook shapes, the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis is known to coincide with
the Springer basis for Sn (see Güemes[14]); the conjecture [18] 6.3 also
holds for two-row shapes, because of the equations established in Chap-
ter 5 and the work of Lascoux-Schützenberger[20] (see also Westbury[29]
and Wolper[30]). In fact, for representations of Sn labeled by hooks and
two-rows (and all left cells for which the Bruhat order coincides with the
weak Bruhat order), [18] 6.3 is known in the sense that Hotta’s transfor-
mation formula(see Hotta[15] and Borho-Brylinski-MacPherson[2]) for the
Springer basis coincides with the Kazhdan-Lusztig transformation formula
(see Douglass[8]).
   It is not yet clear how the results of this dissertation fit into the frame-
work of the above results and counterexamples. The Kazhdan-Lusztig inner
products, properly normalized, are always polynomials that are symmetric
34                          FRANCIS Y. C. FUNG


around 0; that is, invariant with respect to the map t → t−1 . So we would
like them to correspond to a method of associating a symmetric Poincaré
polynomial to each component (and to each pairwise intersection of com-
ponents) of the Springer fiber. In the cases in this work, all components
and intersections were nonsingular, so the homology Poincaré polynomi-
als were already symmetric, once shifted appropriately. A natural choice
for a symmetric Poincaré polynomial to a singular variety is the intersec-
tion homology Poincaré polynomial. In the nonsingular case, intersection
homology coincides with ordinary homology, except for the shift. Also, in-
tersection homology satisfies the crucial Decomposition Theorem[1]. How-
ever, it appears that the natural conjecture extending Theorems 6.2 and
7.2 using intersection homology alone is not correct. The first example of a
singular component arises in S6 (see Vargas[28] and Spaltenstein[24]). This
component X is specified in our notation by the tableau
                                     6 4
                                     5 2
                                     3
                                     1
and X can be given the following description. The component X consists
of flags F such that F2 ⊂ ker N , F2 ∩ im N has dimension at least 1,
F4 ∩ ker N has dimension at least 3, F4 ⊂ N −1 (F2 ), and im N ⊂ F4 . In
the Spaltenstein- Vargas subset for this component, F2 ∩ im N is a one-
dimensional space p and F4 is chosen in N −1 (p) to contain im N . Since
F4 and ker N are both 4-dimensional subspaces of the 5-dimensional space
N −1 (p), their intersection F4 ∩ ker N = P L must have at least dimension
3 and contain im N .
   The singular set of the component X consists of those flags such that
F2 = im N and F4 = ker N . In those cases, the one-dimensional subspace
p is no longer uniquely determined, nor is the 3-dimensional space P L. If,
for each flag in X, we choose a 1-dimensional subspace in im N ∩ F2 and a
3-dimensional subspace in F4 ∩ ker N , then the resulting space X̃ of such
triples is a resolution of singularities of X. Also, the fiber over a point in
the singular set is a CP1 × CP1 . The singular set has complex codimension
4. Thus the resolution is semismall.
   We can see that space X̃ has homology Poincaré polynomial equal to
[2][2][2][2][2][2][2] as follows. The choice of a 1-dimensional subspace p in
im N is a CP1 . Then the choice of a 3-dimensional space P L in ker N ,
containing im N , is a CP1 . Then the choice of a 2-dimensional space F2
containing p and contained in P L is a CP1 . The choice of a space F4
containing P L and contained in the 5-dimensional space N −1 (p) is another
CP1 . Finally, since X is a union of lines of types 1, 3, and 5, the other
choices each contribute a CP1 . This exhibits X̃ as an iterated fiber bundle.

   The semismall Decomposition Theorem says that the intersection homol-
ogy Poincaré polynomial IP (X̃) of the resolution X̃ equals the sum of IP ’s
of strata of X, each with multiplicity equal to the number of components
of the fiber over the point in the stratum. So we can compute IP (X), since
we know that the fiber over each point in the stratum CP1 × CP1 × CP1
is CP1 × CP1 . Thus [2][2][2][2][2][2][2] = IP (X) + [2][2][2]. However, the
entry in our normalized inner product matrix is [2][2][2][2][2][2][2], which is
larger the homology Poincaré polynomial of X̃.
   However, this suggests that perhaps the inner products correspond to
some other semisimple perverse sheaves (see Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne[1])
in the intersections KA ∩ KB , since semisimple perverse sheaves also sat-
isfy the Decomposition Theorem and have symmetric Poincaré polynomi-
als. We also have examples of inner products (from the same shape as the
above example) that are the sum of intersection homology Poincaré polyno-
mials of multiple irreducible components of the corresponding intersection
of two components of the Springer fiber. This lends further weight to the
idea of using semisimple perverse sheaves on the intersection KA ∩ KB
of two components of the Springer fiber, since the appropriate Poincaré
polynomial is obtained by summing the Poincaré polynomials of the irre-
ducible components of the intersection KA ∩ KB . The data also suggests
that it would be worthwhile to investigate the structure of resolutions of
singularities of components of Springer fibers.
   There is now W -graph data available up to S15 (see Ochiai-Kako[23])
and it would be interesting to compute the inner products of the Kazhdan-
Lusztig basis vectors from them. For instance, one could check whether
they satisfy the Hard Lefschetz theorem.
   There is of course more to be done on the computation of the topology of
the components of the Springer fibers. The techniques exposed here exploit
the relative simplicity of the structures of the nilpotent maps for hook and
two-row types. It would be interesting to understand these components
better. Even in the two-row case, it would be worthwhile to gain more
information on the structure of the fiber bundles, for instance extensions
of Lorist’s theorem[21] concerning the e-invariants of the nontrivial CP1
bundles.
   We believe that further study of the Kazhdan-Lusztig inner products and
their relation to the components of Springer fibers will prove to be fruitful,
and that there are many questions left to be answered here.
