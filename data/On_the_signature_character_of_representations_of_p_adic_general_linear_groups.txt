                                                 representations of GLN (F ) for a p-adic field F . We further give a conjectural de-
                                                 scription for the signature character of unramified representations in terms of Kostka
                                                 numbers.




                                            0. Introduction.
                                               Let F be a finite extension of the field Qp of p-adic rational numbers and let G∨
                                            be a connected reductive group over F . Let I ⊂ G(F ) be an Iwahori subgroup.
                                            We consider irreducible admissible (complex) representations V of G(F ) such that
                                            the space of Iwahori fixed vectors V I is nonzero. It is well known that those repre-
                                            sentations correspond to representations of the Hecke algebra H associated to the
                                            extended Weyl group W̃ of G. Moreover Barbasch and Moy proved in [BM1] that
                                            V is Hermitian (resp. unitary) if and only if V I is Hermitian (resp. unitary) with
                                            respect to a certain involution of H.
                                               The Hecke algebra H contains the group algebra C[W ] of the Weyl group of G
                                            as a subalgebra. In particular we can consider for every irreducible H-module V
                                            and for every irreducible representation λ of W the space Vλ = HomW (λ, V ). If V
                                            is Hermitian, Vλ inherits a Hermitian form. In this article we study the signatures
                                            σλ (V ) of this induced Hermitian form for G = GLN . We call the tuple (σλ (V ))λ
                                            the signature character of V .
                                               To do this we reduce the problem to an analogous one for modules with real
                                            central character of a certain graded Hecke algebra H defined by Lusztig [Lu2].
                                            Again we can consider C[W ] as a subalgebra of H. For these H-modules there is
                                            a classification analogous to the Langlands classification which parametrizes irre-
                                            ducible representations in terms of subsets S of a chosen basis of roots, a tempered
                                            representation U of the standard Levi subgroup M corresponding to S and a dom-
                                            inant real character ν of the center of M . These irreducible H-modules L(S, U, ν)
                                            are quotients of so called standard modules X(S, U, ν).
                                               Our strategy to calculate the signature character is the following: We fix S
                                            and U as above. The dominant real characters ν form a cone. Those ν such
                                            that X(S, U, ν) is reducible define affine hyperplanes in this cone. We call these
                                            hyperplanes “reducibility walls”. For ν outside the reducibility walls the signature
                                                                                                                      Typeset by AMS-TEX
                                                                                           1
2                           C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

character is locally constant in ν. Moreover, “nearby zero” Tadič’s classification of
unitary representations of GLN [Ta] implies that X(S, U, ν) = L(S, U, ν) is unitary.
As it is possible to determine the C[W ]-structure of the standard modules, we know
the signature character of L(S, U, ν) for small ν.
   On the other hand a limit argument by Barbasch and Moy [BM3] also gives
an expression of the Hermitian form for ν “nearby infinity” which allows us to
express the signature character purely in terms of the character of the symmetric
groups and certain Kostka numbers. For example our description of the signature
at infinity implies that for S = ∅ we have σλ = χλ (w0 ) at infinity (where χ denotes
the character of representations of W and w0 is the longest element in W ). Hence to
calculate the remaining signature characters we fix a ν0 lying on a single reducibility
wall and a one paramater family t 7→ ν(t) for small t with ν(0) = ν0 such that ν(t)
does not lie on the reducibility wall for t 6= 0. We then would like to express the
sum or the difference of the signature characters of L(S, U, ν(t)) for positive and
negative t.
   We cannot do this for all reducibility walls. Instead of this we concentrate on
those walls which are needed to calculate the signature character for unramified
representation (i.e. for those representations with S = ∅). Here we give a precise
conjecture for the difference and the sum of signature characters of both sides.
Moreover we prove this conjecture for unramified representations. As a consequence
we get an explict expression of the signature character of unramified representations
L(∅, 1, ν) with L(∅, 1, ν) = X(∅, 1, ν) in terms of Kostka numbers. We also give
a description of the signature characters on the reducibility walls for unramified
representations.
    We will now give a short overview over the organization of our work: In the
first chapter we describe the equivalence between irreducible representations V of
G∨ (F ) with V I 6= (0) and irreducible representations with real central character of
the associated graded Hecke algebra H. The second chapter contains three classifi-
cations of irreducible H-modules. The first is in terms of conjugacy classes of pairs
(s, e) of a semisimple element s and a nilpotent element e in the Lie algebra glN .
The second one is the Langlands classification already described above. And the
third classification is the translation of the Bernstein-Zelevinsky classification of
representations of GLN (F ) in terms of supercuspidal representations to the setting
of graded Hecke algebras. We also explain how to obtain one classification from
one of the other ones.
    In the third chapter we introduce the Zelevinsky involution which will allow us
to calculate also the signature character of irreducible representations L(S, U, ν)
which are a proper quotient of the standard module X(S, U, ν). The content of
the fourth chapter is the description of the W -module structure of the standard
modules.
    The fifth chapter contains the classification of Hermitian and unitary H-modules
and the formal definition of the signature character of an irreducible H-module. In
the sixth chapter we express the Hermitian form on standard modules in terms of
a certain intertwining operator. Here we follow closely Barbasch and Moy [BM3].

Chapter Seven contains the description of the reducibility walls and also the theo-
rem that for unramified representations the isolated unitary representions are pre-
cisely those which lie on the intersection of [N/2] reducibility walls. In the eighth
chapter we give an explicit algorithm to compute the signature “nearby infinity”.
We do this by making more precise a description of Barbasch and Moy given in
[BM3].
   The nineth chapter now deals with the topic of crossing the reducibility walls.
We define the “height” of such a wall and study reducibility walls of height 1 and
2 in more detail as those are the walls which occur in the unramified case. Then
we prove our wall crossing theorems in the unramified case. We further formulate
a conjecture for the general case of crossing reducibility walls of height one.
   In the tenth chapter we give a conjecture for crossing certain walls of height
bigger than one and use these conjectures to give an explicit description of the
signature character for unramified representations in terms of Kostka numbers.
Finally in the last chapter we calculate the signature character for all Hermitian
representation of GLN for N = 2, 3 and 4.
   Notations: We use the following notations: All algebraic varieties and all rep-
resentations are assumed to be over the complex numbers C.
   If R is any ring, we denote by Mn (R) the ring of (n × n)-matrices. If A ∈ Mn (R)
 B∈ Mm (R) are two matrices we denote by A ⊕ B ∈ Mn+m (R) the bloc matrix
and
 A 0
 0 B
            , and diag(α1 , . . . , αN ) ∈ MN (R) denotes the diagonal matrix with entries
α1 , . . . , αN ∈ R. Finally let IN ∈ GLN (R) be the identity matrix.
   If W is a finite group, we denote by Ŵ the set of isomorphism classes of irre-
ducible representations of W .

1. Representations of p-adic groups and graded Hecke algebras

1.1. Let G∨ be a split (connected) reductive group over a p-adic field F and let G
be the Langlands dual group over C. Let R = (X, Y, R, R∨, Π) be the based root
datum of G and sα ∈ GL(X) the reflections associated to the roots α ∈ R. Denote
by W the Weyl group of R, i.e. the group generated by the sα for α ∈ R. The root
base Π defines a partial order on R∨ by α∨     ∨     ∨    ∨
                                          1 ≤ α2 if α2 − α1 is a linear combination
with nonnegative integer coefficients of elements of {α∨ | α ∈ Π}. We denote by
Πm the set of all β ∈ R such that β ∨ is a minimal element for this partial order.
   Elements in the semidirect product W f = W ⋉ X are written in the form wax
for w ∈ W and x ∈ X. We set
                      Se = {sα | α ∈ Π} ∪ {sα aα | α ∈ Πm } ⊂ W
                                                              f.

The root base Π defines a system of positive roots R+ ⊂ R and a length function
                       f → N0 ,
                    l: W
                            X                              X
                  l(wax ) =            |hx, α∨ i + 1| +             |hx, α∨ i|
                              α∈R+                         α∈R+
                             w(α)∈R−                      w(α)∈R+
4                          C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

                                                                   f which is
which extends the usual length function on the Coxeter subgroup of W
             e
generated by S.
  We further set
                           R♭ = {α ∈ R | α∨ ∈ 2Y }.
For example if (X, Y, R, R∨, Π) is simple and simply connected (i.e. it is indecom-
posable and R∨ generates Y ), R♭ is nonempty iff the Dynkin type is Bn .

1.2. We are interested in the following category of representations of G∨ (F ):
Let I ⊂ G∨ (F ) be an Iwahori subgroup. We call a smooth representation V on a
complex vector space I-spherical if it is of finite length and if every subquotient of
V is generated by its fixed vectors with respect to I.
   Denote by H(G∨ //I) the Hecke algebra of G∨ (F ) with respect to I. The un-
derlying vector space consists of the C-valued functions of the (discrete) quotient
I\G∨ (F )/I with finite support, and the algebra structure is given by convolution.
For every smooth representation V of G∨ (F ) the space of I-fixed vectors V I is
naturally an H(G∨ //I)-module and the functor V 7→ V I induces an equivalence
between the category of I-spherical representations of G∨ (F ) and the category of
left H(G∨ //I)-modules which are of finite length (or equivalently finite dimensional
as C-vector spaces).

1.3. The Hecke algebra H(G∨ //I) can be described directly in terms of generators
and relations using the based root datum R. More precisely, it can be considered
as a specialization of the affine Hecke algebra H = HR associated to R which is
defined as follows:
   Let B be the braid group of R, i.e. the group with generators Tw for w ∈ W    f
and relations Tw Tw′ = Tww′ whenever l(w) + l(w′ ) = l(ww′ ). Denote by z an
indeterminate. Then H is the C[z, z −1 ]-algebra which is the quotient of the group
algebra (over C[z, z −1 ]) of the braid group B by the two sided ideal generated by
the elements
                                   (Ts + 1)(Ts − z 2 )
        e For w ∈ W
for s ∈ S.          f we denote the image of Tw in H again by Tw .
   Let q be the number of elements in the residue field (of the ring of integers) of
F and denote by ξq : C[z, z −1 ] → C the C-algebra homomorpism which sends z to
q. Then a classical result of Iwahori and Matsumoto [IM] shows that H(G∨ //I) is
isomorphic to H ⊗C[z,z −1 ],ξq C.

1.4. We collect some properties of H: Let

                    Xdom = {x ∈ X | hx, α∨ i ≥ 0 for all α ∈ Π}

be the set of dominant weights. We define for x ∈ X an element T̄x ∈ B as follows:
Write x = x1 − x2 with x1 , x2 ∈ Xdom and set

                                   T̄x = Tax1 Ta−1
                                                x2 .
                     SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                              5

This is easily seen to be well-defined. Its image in H is again denoted by T̄x . Further
set
                                   θx = z −l(T̄x ) T̄x ∈ H
where l: B → Z is the unique extension of the length function l to B.
   Let O be the group algebra of X over the ring C[z, z −1 ]. Then the map x 7→ θx
defines an embedding of C[z, z −1 ]-algebras O → H ([Lu2] 3.4). In the sequel we
consider O as a subring of H. We further have (loc. cit. 3.7 and 3.11):
Proposition. The Hecke algebra H is a free left O-module and a free right O-
module with basis {Tw | w ∈ W } in each case. The center Z of the Hecke algebra
H consists the W -invariants of O.

1.5. Every finite-dimensional left H-module V admits a (unique) primary decom-
position with respect to the center Z of H
                                            M
                                      V =       Vχ
                                            χ


where χ runs through the set of characters of the center Z. As Z = OW =
C[z, z −1 ][X]W , the characters of Z are given by pairs (W t, z0 ) where W t is a W -
orbit of T = Y ⊗Z C× and where z0 ∈ C× . This induces a decomposition of the
category of finite-dimensional left H-modules into the direct sum of the categories
H Modχ of finite-dimensional left H-modules V such that ζ − χ(ζ) is nilpotent on
V for all ζ ∈ Z. If χ corresponds to the pair (W t, z0 ), we also write H ModW t,z0 .

1.6. The categories H ModW t,z0 are equivalent to categories of finite-dimensional
left H-modules where H is a graded version of H. Instead of explaining how to
obtain H from H by grading with respect to a certain ideal, we give the abstract
definition of the graded Hecke algebra H = HR associated to a reduced root datum
R = (X, Y, R, R∨, Π).
   We set O = C[r] ⊗C Sym(X ⊗Z C). It carries an action by W induced by the
trivial action on C[r] and the canonical action on X. As a C-vector space we have

                                   H = O ⊗C C[W ]

with a structure of associative C-algebra with unit 1 ⊗ e, defined by the rules:
    (i)   O → H, θ 7→ θ ⊗ e is an algebra homomorphism.
   (ii)   C[W ] → H, w 7→ 1 ⊗ w is an algebra homomorphism.
  (iii)   (θ ⊗ e)(1 ⊗ w) = θ ⊗ w for θ ∈ O and w ∈ W .
  (iv)    For all α ∈ Π and θ ∈ X we have

                  (1 ⊗ sα )(θ ⊗ e) − (sα θ ⊗ e)(1 ⊗ sα ) = 2rαhα∨ , θi.

   (v) r is in the center of H.
6                            C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

   Usually we will omit the ⊗ when denoting elements in H and write tw instead of
1 ⊗ w. For α ∈ R we further set tα := tsα . For example the relation (iv) becomes
                              tα · θ − sα θ · tα = 2rhα∨ , θi.
Note that this relation is equivalent to
                              θ · tα − tα · sα θ = 2rhα∨ , θi.
1.7. The center of H consists of the W -invariants of O. As above we get a
decomposition of the category of finite-dimensional left H-modules into categories
H ModW u,r0 where (W u, r0 ) runs through the set of pairs consisting of a W -orbit
of an elements u ∈ Y ⊗Z C and a complex number r0 .
   In the sequel we will consider a character of the center of H also as a pair ({s}, r0 )
where {s} is a G-conjugacy class of a semisimple element of g and where r0 is a
complex number.

1.8. The relation between H-modules and H-modules is the following (see [Lu2]
8-10 and [Lu3] 4): As we are mainly interested in the case G = GLN we make the
following additional assumptions to simplify notations:
      • The derived group of G is simply connected (or equivalently the center of
        G∨ is connected).
      • R♭ = ∅.
   Fix a central character of H corresponding to a pair (W t, z0 ). To simplify nota-
tions further we assume that z0 is a positive real number, different from 1. Further
we choose an auxiliary t in the Weyl orbit W t. The following constructions will
be independent of this choice (up to isomorphism which is given by w ∈ W if t is
replaced by wt). We can decompose T = C× ⊗Z Y into an elliptic and a hyperbolic
part, namely T = Tell × Th where
                  Tell = {z ∈ C× | |z| = 1} ⊗ Y,         Th = R>0 ⊗ Y.
This is a decomposition of real Lie groups. We can therefore write uniquely t = te th
where te ∈ Tell and th ∈ Th .
  Let R(t) = (X, Y, R(t), R∨(t), Π(t)) be the root datum with
                             R(t) = {α ∈ R | α(te ) = 1},
                            R∨ (t) = {α∨ ∈ R∨ | α ∈ R(t)}.
Then R+ (t) = R(t) ∩ R+ is a system of positive roots and the associated set of
simple roots is Π(t). We write W (t) for the Weyl group of the root datum R(t).
   Denote by
                        logz02 : Th = R>0 ⊗ ZY → R ⊗ ZY
the isomorphism induced by
                              ∼
                        R>0 −→ R,          x 7→ log(x)/2 log(z0 ).
   Note that the isomorphism class of R(t) does not depend on the choice of t in
its Weyl orbit
    The relation between H-modules and H-modules is now given by the next propo-
sition.

1.9. Proposition.       The categories   HR ModW t,z0    and   HR(t) ModW (t) logz2 (th ),1/2
                                                                                   0

are equivalent. More precisely, denote by Ĥ (resp. Ĥ) the completion of HR (resp.

is the category of modules of finite length over Ĥ resp. Ĥ). Then Ĥ and Ĥ are
Morita equivalent.
Proof. This follows from the main result of [Lu2] 8-10 and [Lu3] 4 with simpler
notation due to our assumptions. We also replace the indeterminate r in loc. cit.
by r/2 log(z0 ). First of all we can replace R by its derived root datum der(R) =
                       ∨
(Xder , Yder , Rder , Rder , Πder ), i.e. Yder = Y ∩ hα | α ∈ RiR . Then Yder is a direct
summand of Y and if we set Tder = Yder ⊗C× , we get a decomposition T = T ′ ×Tder
such that α(t′ ) = 1 for all α ∈ R and hence a decomposition t = t′ tder . Now R(t),
R∨ (t) and W (t) depend only on the derived root datum and on tder .
   Now our assumption in (1.8) implies that we are in the situation of [Lu3] 4.4.
Then loc. cit. 4.5 shows that the group Γt defined in [Lu2] 8.1 is trivial which implies
the result as explained in [Lu3] 4.9. 

1.10. If R is the root datum of G = GLN or more generally of a reductive group G
whose simple components are of Dynkin type An , then for any choice of t the root
datum R(t) is the root datum of a Levi subgroup of G, namely of the centralizer
of te (after considering T as a maximal torus of G which is well defined up to
conjugacy). For other Dynkin types this is not true in general.

2. Classification of H-modules

2.1. From now on we make the simplifying assumption that G is isomorphic to
a Levi subgroup of GLN (hence isomorphic to a product of groups of the form
GLNi ). Let R = (X, Y, R, R∨, Π) the based root datum of G, W its Weyl group,
and denote by H the associated Hecke algebra. We fix r0 ∈ C \ {0}, and denote by
Irrr0 (H) the set of equivalence classes of irreducible H-modules, where r ∈ H acts
by r0 .

2.2. We set t = Y ⊗ C and denote by t∗ = X ⊗ C the dual. Define further

                     z = {λ ∈ t | hλ, αi = 0 for all α ∈ R},
                     z∗ = {x ∈ t∗ | hα∨ , xi = 0 for all α∨ ∈ R∨ }.

Then z is canonically isomorphic to the center of Lie(G) and the duality of t and t∗
induces a perfect duality of z and z∗ . The subspace z∗ of X ⊗C has as a complement
the space generated by α ∈ R.
   Every element ν ∈ z defines a one-dimensional HG -module Cν = Cν,r0 where r
acts by multiplication with r0 , α ∈ R acts by multiplication with 2r, ξ ∈ z∗ acts by
ν(ξ) and sα acts trivially.
8                           C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

2.3. Let S ⊂ Π be a subset and denote by (X, Y, RS , RS∨ , S) the corresponding
subroot system with Weyl group WS and associated graded Hecke algebra HS . For
this root system we have the subspaces zS and z∗S as in (2.2). Note that HS is
isomorphic to the graded Hecke algebra associated to a Levi subgroup M of G and
that M again satisfies the condition in (2.1).
   We have a canonical embedding HS ⊂ H which makes H into a free HS -module
of rank #(W/WS ). If U is a HS -module we also write IndH
                                                        HS (U ) instead of H⊗HS U .


2.4. By [Lu1I] there exists a bijection between Irrr0 (H) and the set of G-conjugacy
classes of pairs of the form (s, e) where s ∈ g is semisimple, e ∈ g is nilpotent such
that
                                     [s, e] = 2r0 e.
Denote by LG (s, e, r0 ) = L(s, e) the irreducible H-module corresponding to the
conjugacy class {(s, e)} of (s, e). By [Lu5] 1.15, L(s, e) is the unique irreducible
quotient of a standard module XG (s, e, r0 ) = X(s, e) associated to {(s, e)}. See
[Lu1] 8 and [Lu4] 10 for the definition of the X(s, e) (and [Lu4] 10.11 for the fact
that both constructed modules are isomorphic).

2.5. By definition of the standard module XG (s, e, r0 ) [Lu1] 8, its central character
exists and is given by the pair ({s}, r0 ) (1.7). In particular this is also true for the
irreducible quotient Lr0 (s, e).

2.6. Next we will describe the Langlands classification. Let s ∈ g = glN be
semisimple and e ∈ glN nilpotent such that [s, e] = 2r0 e. First choose a homomor-
phism of Lie algebras
                                    ψ : sl2 −→ glN
                                                                      
such that e = ψ 00 10 and such that [s, f ] = −2r0 f where f = 01 00 . This
                                                                        
                                                                     1 0
implies [s, h] = [s, [e, f ]] = 0 by the Jacobi identity if h = ψ 0 −1 . Such a
homomorphism exists and is uniquely determined up to conjugation with z ∈ G
such that Ad(z)e = e and Ad(z)s = s by a variant of the Jacobson-Morozov theorem
(see [KL] 2.4(g) and 2.4(h)).

2.7. From now on assume that r0 is a positive real number and that the conjugacy
class of s is in (Y ⊗Z R)/W and define t := s − r0 h. Then t is a semisimple element
of g whose conjugacy class depends only on the conjugacy class of (s, e). Note that
t commutes with s and with the image of ψ. We call the conjugacy class of (s, e)
(or the associated simple module L(s, e)) tempered if t = 0.
   If {(s, e)} is tempered, we have L(s, e) = X(s, e) by [Lu5] 1.21.

2.8. We state the following version of Langlands classification for H-modules
which is a slight reformulation of [Ev] (recall that we assume that r0 ∈ R and
{s} ∈ (Y ⊗Z R)/W ):

Theorem. For every irreducible H-module V there exists a triple (S, U, ν) where
S is a subset of Π, U is an irreducible tempered representation of HS and where

              ν ∈ z+
                   S = {λ ∈ zS ∩ Y ⊗ R | hλ, αi > 0 for all α ∈ Π \ S}


such that V is the unique irreducible quotient of IndH   HS (U ⊗ Cν ). Further S and ν
and the isomorphism class of U are uniquely determined by the isomorphism class
of V . We set L(S, U, ν) = V and X(S, U, ν) = IndH    HS (U ⊗ Cν ).
   If L(S , U , ν ) is any other irreducible subquotient of IndH
          ′   ′   ′
                                                               HS (U ⊗Cν ) coming from
            ′   ′   ′             ′
a triple (S , U , ν ), we have ν < ν (with respect to the extended Bruhat order on
f ).
W
   The triple (S, U, ν) is called Langlands data associated to V .

2.9. We keep the notations of (2.6). In particular we have the G-conjugacy
class {(s, e)} and the associated irreducible H-module L(s, e). We are now going
to explain how to obtain the Langlands data (S, U, ν) corresponding to L(s, e).
We follow [Lu5] 3.9ff choosing for τ in loc. cit. the homomorphism C → R which
associates to each complex number its real part. We use a somewhat more explicit
but less canonical description. For this we fix a Borel subgroup B of G and a
maximal torus T of G contained in G which gives an identification of the abstract
based root datum R with the based root datum of (G, B, T ). In particular we have
an identification Lie(T ) = t = Y ⊗ C. The conjugacy class of s is then an element
in (Y ⊗ R)/W (because we assumed that s is real). After G-conjugation we can
assume that s is a diagonal matrix and that (s, e) = (s1 , e1 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (sl , el ) where
ei is of the form                                    
                                   0
                                 1 0                 
                                                     
                            ei = 
                                 
                                       1 0            .
                                                      
                                         .. ..       
                                            .     .
                                                1 0
Let σi be the first entry in the diagonal matrix si . We can assume that σ1 + 21 m1 ≥
· · · ≥ σm + 12 ml . Now we can choose ψ as in (2.6) such that h ∈ Y ⊗ R ⊂ t, in
particular t = s − r0 h ∈ Y ⊗ R. We have ht, αi ≥ 0 for all α ∈ Π.
     We set
                               S = {α ∈ Π | ht, αi = 0}.
Then HS is isomorphic to the graded Hecke algebra associated to Levi subalgebra
m = Centg (t). Note that s and the image of ψ are contained m. Let M be the
corresponding Levi subgroup of G. As the derived group of G is simply connected,
we have M = ZG (t). Further we have [r0 h, e] = 2r0 e. Hence the conjugacy class of
(r0 h, e) defines an irreducible representation

                                    U := LM (r0 h, e)
10                                C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

of HS . By definition this is a tempered representation of HS . Finally let ν by the
dominant representative of the W -orbit of t. By definition we have ν ∈ z+    S . We
then have U ⊗ Cν = LM (s, e) = XM (s, e) and by [Lu5] 3.38 we have XG (s, e) =
IndH
   HM (U ⊗ Cν ).

2.10. For the rest of chapter 2 let us assume that G = GLN . Hence the p-adic
group G∨ is isomorphic to GLN and we have the classification of representations
of the p-adic group GLN (F ) by Bernstein-Zelevinsky in terms of supercuspidal
representations. By a theorem of Casselman (see e.g. [Ca] 3.8) an irreducible ad-
missible representation of GLN (F ) admits nontrivial fixed vector under an Iwa-
hori subgroup if and only if its supercuspidal support consists of unramified quasi-
characters. Using (1.9) we obtain a classification of irreducible H-modules where
r ∈ H acts by 1/2 (or equivalently a classification of irreducible modules of the
algebra H1/2 = (H ⊗C[r],r7→1/2 C)) which we call the BZ-classification. We further
can assume that the central character is real. It is described in the next sections.

                           1/2
2.11. For G = GL1 , HG is nothing but a polynomial algebra in one indeterminate
                                                                               1/2
and we consider any complex number as a one-dimensional representation of HGL1 .
       ~ = (N1 , . . . , Nm ) be a tuple of positive integers and set GL ~ = GLN ×
   Let N                                                                       N          1

                                i
module of
                                  1/2     1/2              1/2

whose underlying vector space is V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vm and which is endowed with the
componentwise action. We further set

                                          1/2
                    V1 ⊡ · · · ⊡ Vm = HGLN ⊗H1/2 (V1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ Vm )

                                                      N



where N = N1 + · · · + Nm .
  If in particular (σ1 , . . . , σm ) is a tuple of complex numbers, σ1 ⊡ · · · ⊡ σm is a
 1/2
HGLm -module.

2.12. Given m ∈ N and σ a real number, define the segment

                           ∆(σ, m) = [σ, σ + 1, . . . , σ + m − 1].

The real number σ + m−1  2 is called the center of ∆(σ, m), and the integer m ≥ 1 is
called the length of ∆(σ, m).
   Consider ∆1 = ∆(σ1 , m1 ) and ∆2 = ∆(σ2 , m2 ) two segments. We will say that
∆1 and ∆2 are linked if ∆1 6⊆ ∆2 and ∆2 6⊆ ∆1 and ∆1 ∪∆2 is of the form ∆(τ, m′ ),
for some τ ∈ {σ1 , σ2 }.
   Further, we say that ∆1 precedes ∆2 , if ∆1 and ∆2 are linked and τ = σ1 .
                       SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                                       11

2.13. With these definitions we can establish the following facts ([Ze],[KL], [Ku]):
   (1) Take ∆ = ∆(σ, m) as above. Then, σ ⊡(σ +1)⊡· · ·⊡(σ +m−1) is reducible
       for m > 1 and has a unique irreducible quotient L(∆).
   (2) Let (∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) be a tuple of segments as above, and assume that ∆i
       does not preceed ∆j for i < j, then L(∆1 ) ⊡ · · · ⊡ L(∆l ) admits a unique
       irreducible quotient L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ).
                                                                   1/2
   (3) Every irreducible admissible representation of HGLN is isomorphic to some
       L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) where (∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) is a tuple as in (2). If (∆′1 , . . . , ∆′k ) is
       any other tuple as in (2) such that L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) ∼       = L(∆′1 , . . . , ∆′k ) then
       l = k and ∆′i = ∆π(i) for some permutation π ∈ Sl .
   (4) L(∆1 ) ⊡ · · · ⊡ L(∆l ) is irreducible if and only if no two segments ∆i and ∆j
       are linked.
   We set
                          X(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) := L(∆1 ) ⊡ · · · ⊡ L(∆l ).

2.14. Let us connect the BZ-classification with the classification by conjugacy
classes of pairs (s, e) such that [s, e] = e (note that to simplify we are still in the
case r0 = 1/2 which we can assume anyway because of (1.9)).
                                                                                    1/2
   Let V = L(∆(σ1 , m1 ), . . . , ∆(σl , ml )) be an irreducible representation of HGLN
with N = m1 + · · · ml . Denote by γi = σi + 12 (mi − 1) the center of ∆(σi , mi ). We
assume that γ1 ≥ γ2 ≥ · · · ≥ γl which in particular implies that ∆(σi , mi ) does not
precede ∆(σj , mj ) for i < j. We set
                    l
                    M                                                           l

               s=         diag(σi , σi + 1, . . . , σi + mi − 1),          e=         nm i
                    i=1                                                         i=1

where nd is the nilpotent (d × d)-matrix
                                                                     
                                  0
                                1 0                                  

                           nd = 
                                
                                     1 0                              .
                                                                      
                                        ..              ..           
                                            .                 .
                                                         1        0
                                                       1/2
Then we have [s, e] = e and the irreducible HGLN -module associated to the conju-
gacy class of (s, e) is isomorphic to V .
   Now we can use (2.9) to compute the corresponding Langlands triple (S, U, ν).
For this we have to construct the element t: We assume that the based root datum
is given by the Borel pair T ⊂ B of GLN where T is the diagonal torus and B the
Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices. The simple roots in Π are then given
by the linear forms αi : diag(x1 , . . . , xN ) 7→ xi − xi+1 for i = 1, . . . , N − 1. 
   As homomorphism ψ: sl2 → glN we choose the unique ψ such that ψ 00 10 =

2.15. We give an example: Let V be the irreducible HGL6 -module given by the
sequence of segments
                             ([2, 3], [0, 1, 2], [1]).
Then we have V = L(s, e) where s = diag(2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1) and
                                                                
                                  0
                                1       0                       
                                                                
                                                0               
                              e=                                .
                                                1    0          
                                                                

Further t = diag(5/2, 5/2, 1, 1, 1, 1) and hence S = Π \ {α2 }. The tempered rep-

                   1/2                               1/2
product of the HGL2 -module U1 and the HGL4 -module U2 where U1 is given (with
respect to the BZ-classification) by [−1/2, 1/2] and U2 is given by ([−1, 0, 1], [0]).
We have z+                                       6
          S = {(x1 , x1 , x2 , x2 , x2 , x2 ) ∈ R | x1 > x2 } and ν = (5/2, 5/2, 1, 1, 1, 1).


2.16. We remark that we can also check the irreducibility of X(s, e) directly: The
Levi subgroup ZG (s) acts on the vector space {n ∈ glN | [s, n] = n} by conjugation
and X(s, e) is irreducible if and only if e lies in the unique open orbit of that action.

2.17. Let M be a multiset of segments and let X(M) be the corresponding
standard module. The irreducible subquotients of X(M) can be described as follows
([Ze]):
   An elementary operation on a multiset M is by definition to take two segments
∆1 and ∆2 which are linked from M and to replace them by ∆1 ∪ ∆2 and ∆1 ∩ ∆2 .
For two multisets M1 and M2 we say that M1  M2 if M1 can be obtained from
M2 by elementary operations.
   With this definition we have that L(M′ ) occurs as irreducible subquotient of
X(M) if and only if M′  M.
   Further, X(M) has a unique irreducible quotient and a unique irreducible sub-
module and the isomorphism classes of both of them occur with multiplicity one in
X(M).
   Zelevinsky shows in loc. cit. that if all real numbers which occur in all segments
of M are pairwise distinct, L(M′ ) occurs in X(M) with multiplicity one for all
M′  M.

2.18. Let V = L(s, e) = L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) be an irreducible HGLN -module with

equivalent coniditions are satisfied:
   (1) We have e = 0 and s is a regular semisimple element.
   (2) The length of all segments ∆i is equal to 1 and their centers are pairwise
       different.
   (3) S = ∅.

2.19. Let V = L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) be an irreducible HGLN -module with associated
Langlands data (S, U, ν). Then the following assertions are equivalent:
   (1) V is tempered.
   (2) S = Π and ν = 0.
   (3) All centers of the segments ∆i are equal to zero.


3. The Zelevinsky involution

3.1. Let G be a reductive group over C with based root datum (X, Y, R, R∨, Π)
and let HG be the associated graded Hecke algebra. We define an involution on
HG which we show to be induced by the Zelevinsky involution on the affine Hecke
algebra HG for G = GLN . By abuse of notation we will call it also Zelevinsky
involution and denote it by ζ. It is defined as

                       ζ(r) = r,
                      ζ(tw ) = (−1)l(w) tw0 ww0   for w ∈ W ,
                                w0
                       ζ(θ) =        θ            for θ ∈ X

where w0 is the element of maximal length in the Weyl group W of G.
  It is easy to check that ζ preserves the relations in (1.6) defining the graded
Hecke algebra.
  For every HG -module V (where the HG -module structure is given by a C-algebra
homomorphism ρ : HG → End(V )) we write ζ(V ) for the HG -module given by ρ ◦ ζ.
This defines an involutive endofunctor of the category of HG -modules HG Mod.

3.2. Note that from the definition we get the following observation
Remark. Let V be an HG -module which admits a central character χ. Then ζ(V )
also admits a central character χ′ , and we have χ = χ′ .

3.3. We want to describe the effect of ζ on irreducible HGLN -modules given by the
BZ-classification. For this we show that ζ induces Zelevinsky’s involution. To prove
this we make the following definition: Let RN be the Grothendieck group of the
                                  1/2
category of finite-dimensional HGLN -modules with real central character and set
14                            C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

    L
R = N≥0 RN where GL0 is by definition the trivial group (and hence R0 = Z).
The map
          RN1 × RN2 → RN1 +N2 ,       ([V1 ], [V2 ]) 7→ [V1 ⊡ V2 ]
makes R into a graded ring. For every segment ∆ as in (2.12) we have the cor-
responding irreducible representation [L(∆)] ∈ R and the same arguments given
for the analogous statement for representations of GLN (F ) in [Ze] 7 show that this
makes R into the polynomial algebra over Z in indeterminates ∆ where ∆ runs
through all segments.

3.4. The Zelevinsky involution defines an involutive automorphism of the graded
ring R. We define another involution which is by definition the unique involutive
automorphism ζ ′ of R such that

       ζ ′ (L([σ, σ + 1, . . . , σ + m − 1])) = L([σ + m − 1], [σ + m − 2], . . . , [σ])

which is the analog of the automorphism constructed by Zelevinsky in [Ze] 9.12.
Proposition. The involutions ζ and ζ ′ of R coincide.
Proof. This follows from results of Moeglin and Waldspurger [MW] I for the affine
Hecke algebra using (1.9). We remark that the elements Xi (resp. Sj ) of loc. cit.
are those which are called θei (resp. Tsj ) in (1.4) where ei ∈ ZN = X is the i-
th standard base vector and sj is the reflection corresponding to the base root
(x1 , . . . , xN ) 7→ xj − xj+1 . Further not that for the image tsj of Sj in the graded
                                                                                       2
Hecke algebra we have t−1     sj = tsj . Finally note that q in loc. cit. is equal to z in
(1.3) and hence that under the transition to the graded Hecke algebra as described
in (1.9) the factor q becomes 1. 
                                                                                1/2
3.5. Now let V = L(∆(σ1 , m1 ), . . . , ∆(σl , ml )) be an irreducible HGLN -module.
We want to explain the effect of ζ on V . For this we follow [MW] II: Set ∆i =
∆(σi , mi ) and let M be the multiset (i.e. the set with multiplicities) of the segments
∆i . By loc. cit. ζ(V ) is the irreducible representation associated to the mutiset M#
of segments where M# is defined as follows:
   For t ∈ R/Z write Mt = {∆i ∈ M | σi ≡ t mod Z}. Then M is the disjoint
union of the Mt where t runs through R/Z and we set
                                              [
                                     M# =         M#t .
                                             t∈R/Z

   Hence we will from now on assume that σ1 ≡ · · · ≡ σl mod Z. We introduce a
total order on the set of segments by saying ∆(σ1 , m1 ) ≥ ∆(σ2 , m2 ) if

              σ1 > σ2 ,       or      σ1 = σ2    and    σ1 + m1 ≥ σ2 + m2 .

Further, if ∆ = ∆(σ, m), we set

                                    ∆− = ∆(σ, m − 1).
                     SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                            15

  Let δ be the biggest real number appearing in one of the segments of M and let
∆i0 be a segment containing δ which is maximal with this property. Necessarily we
have δ = σi0 + mi0 − 1. Now define inductively integers i1 , . . . , ir :
     – ∆is is a segment of M preceding ∆is −1 such that σis + mis − 1 = δ − s and
       such that ∆is is maximal with this property.
     – ir is the last integer which can be defined this way.
We set
                                M− = (∆′1 , . . . , ∆′l )
where                                
                                         ∆−
                                          i , if i ∈ {i0 , . . . , ir }
                           ∆′i   =
                                         ∆i ,    otherwise.
Note that ∆′i can be empty. Now we define

                          M# = {∆(δ − r, r + 1)} ∪ (M− )#

and proceed inductively.

3.6. We give an example of the effect of ζ: For

              M = ([3, 4], [2, 3, 4], [1, 2], [1/2], [0], [−1/2], [−1, 0, 1])

we get

              M# = ([4], [4], [3], [1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2], [0], [−1/2, 1/2], [−1]).

3.7. There has also been given another combinatorial description of ζ in [KZ].

4. W -structure of standard modules

4.1. We assume in this chapter that G = GLN hence we have W = SN . As
HG contains C[W ] as a subalgebra, every HG -module V has also the structure of
a representation of W . We are interested in the C[W ]-module structure of the
standard modules X(s, e) and the irreducible quotient L(s, e).

4.2. Let us briefly recall some facts of the theory of representations of W = SN . The
set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of SN is denoted by ŜN .
We have two distinguished (irreducible) representations of SN , namely the trivial
representation 1 and the sign representation sgn. These are the only 1-dimensional
representations of SN .
    Denote by P(N ) the set of partitions of N . Given a partition d = [d1 ≥ · · · ≥
dN ≥ 0] ∈ P(N ), define the transpose of d as dt = [dt1 ≥ · · · ≥ dtN ≥ 0] with
dti = #{j | dj ≥ i}. For d ∈ SN we set Sd = Sd1 × · · · × SdN which we embed into
SN in the usual way.
16                            C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

  The set ŜN is in bijection to P(N ): The representation πd corresponding to
d ∈ P(N ) is the unique irreducible representation of SN such that
   (a) The restriction of πd to the subgroup Sd of SN contains a copy of the trivial
       representation.
   (b) The restriction to Sdt contains a copy of the sign representation.
   The tensor product with the sign representation defines an involution on ŜN .
More precisely, we have πdt ∼  = πd ⊗ sgn. The dimension of πd is the number of
standard Young tableaus of shape d.
   On the other hand, there exists a bijective correpondance between the set of
GLN -orbits of nilpotent elements in glN and the set P(N ) given by the block sizes
of the Jordan normal form of the nilpotent element. Combining these two facts we
obtain a bijection between nilpotent orbits in glN and ŜN .
   Via this bijection, the principal nilpotent orbit corresponds to the trivial repre-
sentation, and the zero orbit corresponds to the sign representation.
   On the set of nilpotent G-orbits of g there is a partial order where we say that
O ≤ O′ iff O is contained in the closure of O′ . This corresponds to a partial order
on P(N ) which is given by d ≤ d′ iff d1 +· · ·+dk ≤ d′1 +· · ·+d′k for all k = 1, . . . , N .
Hence we get also a partial order on ŜN such that 1 is the greatest element and
sgn is the smallest element.

4.3. Let e ∈ glN be a nilpotent element, and Be be the variety of Borel subgroups of
GLN that contain e. The Springer correspondence tells us that H ∗ (Be ) = H ∗ (Be , C)
carries an action of the Weyl group W such that H dim(Be ) (Be ) is isomorphic to the
irreducible W -representation corresponding to the G-orbit of e.
   We want to describe the W -action of the standard module XGLN (s, e, r0 ). If we
let r0 vary, these standard modules are by definition the fibres of a vector bundle
with W -action over the affine line. As representations of a finite group cannot be
deformed, the W -structure of XGLN (s, e, r0 ) is independent of r0 . Hence we can
assume r0 = 0 and we have an isomorphism of W -modules ([Lu4] 10.13)
                              X(s, e) ∼
                                      = H ∗ (Be ) ⊗ sgn.
   On the other hand, if d is the partition corresponding to the GLN -orbit of e,
there is an isomorphism of W -modules (e.g. [CP])
                               H ∗ (Be ) ∼
                                         = IndSN (1).
                                                   Sd

   Finally the multiplicity of πd′ in   IndSSN
                                             d
                                               (1)   is given by the Kostka number Kd′ ,d
(see e.g. [Ma] I,6 for a definition).
   Altogether we obtain:
Proposition. Fix an r0 ∈ C. Let s in glN be a semisimple element and e ∈ glN be
a nilpotent element such that [s, e] = 2r0 e. Let e be the partition corresponding to
the GLN -orbit of e. Then the W -structure of the standard module X(s, e) is given
by
                      [X(s, e) : πd ] = Kdt ,e ,   d ∈ P(N ).
In particular, X(s, 0) is isomorphic to C[W ] as a W -module.

4.4. We want to compare the underlying W -module structures of an HGLN -module
V and its image under the Zelevinsky involution as defined in (3.1). The involution
ζ on HGLN restricts to an involution on the subalgabra C[W ] which we denote
again by ζ and which induces an involutive endofunctor ζ of the category Rep(W )
of representations of W . Its effect is described by the following result:
Proposition. Let V be a representation of W . Then we have

                                     ζ(V ) ∼
                                           = V ⊗ sgn.

Proof. This follows directly from the definitions: The endofunctor on Rep(W )
given by ζ is isomorphic to the one given by the involution w 7→ (−1)l(w) w on
C[W ]. 

4.5. Let X(s, e) be a standard module. By (4.3) the λ ∈ Ŵ corresponding to the
dual partition of the Jordan type of e is the unique maximal λ ∈ Ŵ occuring in
X(s, e) and we have [X(s, e) : λ] = 1.
                                                           1/2
   Moreover it follows from [BM1] that the sum X ′ of all HG -submodules of X(s, e)
                                        1/2
which do not contain λ is a maximal HG -submodule of X(s, e) and that we have
X/X ′ = L(s, e).

5. Hermitian and unitary H-modules

5.1. We return briefly to the general notations of the first chapter. The C-vector
space X ⊗Z C has a conjugation coming from the complex conjugation C and this
induces a complex anti-linear algebra involution on Sym(X ⊗Z C) which we denote
by θ 7→ θ̄. For w ∈ W we denote by tw the corresponding element in C[W ] ⊂ HG .
Let w0 ∈ W be the longest element.
   Define the ∗-operation on HG as follows:

               t∗w = tw−1 ,                         for w ∈ W ,
               θ ∗ = (−1)deg θ tw0 (w0 θ̄)tw0 ,     for θ ∈ Sym(X ⊗Z C),
               r ∗ = r.

It is easy to check that this defines a complex anti-linear involution on the algebra
HG . We call a finite-dimensional H-module X Hermitian if there is a non-degenerate
Hermitian form h , i on X such that

                              hH · x1 , x2 i = hx1 , H ∗ · x2 i

for H ∈ H, and x1 , x2 ∈ X. By [BM2] 5 this notion of being Hermitian corresponds
to the obvious one if X comes from an admissible representation of G∨ (F ) be the
procedure described in (1.2) and (1.9).
18                                   C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

                                                                                            1/2
5.2. Now let us again assume that G = GLN and let V be an irreducible HGLN -
module with real central character. We want to express the property that V is
Hermitian in terms of the Langlands and the Bernstein-Zelevinsky classification.
   First let (S, U, ν) be the Langlands data associated to V . Then it follows from
[BM3] 1.5 that V is Hermitian if and only if there exists a w ∈ W satisfying
(1)                                             w(ν) = −ν,
(2)                                             w(S) = S,
(3)                                             w(U ) ∼
                                                      = U.
Because of (1) and ν ∈ z+   S we have necessarily w ∈ w0 WS where WS is the subgroup
of W generated by sα for α ∈ S. If we write Π = {α1 , . . . , αN1 } as in (2.14), the
identity (2) then implies that αi ∈ S if and only if αN−i ∈ S for all i = 1, . . . , N −1.
   Now assume that V = L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ). By [Ta] its Hermitian dual is given by
L(∆h1 , . . . , ∆hl ) where
                  [x, x + 1, . . . , x + m − 1]h = [−(x + m − 1), . . . , −x].
In particular we see:
Proposition. Let V = L(∆1 , . . . , ∆l ) with ∆i = ∆(σi , mi ) be given as above.
Then V is Hermitian if and only if we can group together the segments to pairs ∆i1
and ∆i2 (i1 not necessarily different from i2 ) such that
   (1) The center of ∆i1 is the negative of the center of ∆i2 .
   (2) We have mi1 = mi2 .

5.3. We now recall Tadič’s description of unitary representations [Ta] transferred
to the setting of graded Hecke algebras:
   We phrase this in terms of the Kaszhdan-Lusztig classification: For any integer
d ≥ 1 we define the (d × d)-matrix
                                                    
                                   0
                                1 0                 
                                                    

conjugated to a direct sum of diagonal matrices si which are of one of the following
forms

        0 < αi < 12 .

5.5. Let V be a finite-dimensional Hermitian HG -module and let h , i : V × V → C
be a non-degenerate Hermitian form on V such   L     that hhv, v ′ i = hv, h∗ v ′ i for all
h ∈ HG and all v, v ′ ∈ V . Decompose V =          i∈I Vi into an orthogonal sum of
irreducible W -representations. The restriction h , ii of h , i to Vi is either positive
or negative definite. For each λ ∈ Ŵ we set

              σλ+ (V, h , i) = #{i ∈ I | Vi ∼
                                            = λ, h , ii is positive definite},
              σλ− (V, h , i) = #{i ∈ I | Vi ∼
                                            = λ, h , ii is negative definite},
              σλ (V, h , i) = σλ+ (V, h , i) − σλ− (V, h , i).

These numbers are independent of the choice of the orthogonal decomposition of
V into irreducible W -representations.
    Assume that V is irreducible as an HG -module. In this case h , i is uniquely
determined up to a nonzero real number. Hence the class of (σλ (V, h , i))λ∈Ŵ ∈
ZŴ in ZŴ /{±1} is independant of the choice of h , i (here {±1} acts on ZŴ by
ε · (σλ ) = (εσλ )). We call this class Σ̄(V ).

5.6. If Σ̄ ∈ ZŴ /{±1} is the signature character of some irreducible Hermitian
                                                                           1/2
representation we define a lift Σ ∈ ZŴ as follows: For every irreducible HG -module
V there exists a unique maximal λ ∈ Ŵ such that [V : λ] > 0, and moreover we
have [V : λ] = 1 (4.5). We let Σ be the unique lift of Σ̄ such that Σλ = 1. Using
this normalization, we get a map
                                                     1/2
                  Σ : {irreducible Hermitian HG -modules} → ZŴ .

5.7. The bijection Ŵ → Ŵ which sends U to U ⊗ sgn defines a Z-linear automor-
phism of ZŴ (by taking the corresponding permutation matrix) and this induces a
bijection of order 2 on ZŴ /{±1} which we denote again by [(σλ )] 7→ [(σλ )] ⊗ sgn.
                                              1/2
Proposition. For every irreducible HG -module V we have

                                  Σ̄(ζ(V )) = Σ̄(V ) ⊗ sgn.

Proof. It follows directly from the definitions that the involution ∗ and the Zelevin-
sky involution ζ (3.1) commute with each other. Hence (4.4) implies the proposi-
tion. 

6. Intertwining operators and the Hermitian from

6.1. In the sequel we will use the following notations: We set G = GLN and
fix a standard parabolic subgroup, given by a subset S of the set of the simple
roots, corresponding to an ordered partition (N1 , . . . , Nr ) of N and denote by M
the associated standard Levi subgroup. Instead of HS (2.3) we also write HM .
                                                                 1/2
   Let U be a fixed irreducible tempered representation of HM , hence it will be of
the form
                                 U = U1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ Ur
                                                            1/2
for irreducible tempered representations Ui of HGLN . We denote by h , iUi the
                                                       i
unitary form (unique up to a positive scalar) on Ui and by h , iU its tensor product
on U .
   We will consider (real) Hermitian representations with Langlands data (S, U, ν)
(2.8). Hence we have for all i, Ni = Nr+1−i , and Ui is isomorphic to Ur+1−i . In the
sequel we choose an identification of unitary HGLNi -modules Ui ∼ = Ur+1−i . Finally
                                     +
ν will be given by an element in zS which we can consider as an r-tuple of real
numbers ν ∈ C(N1 ,...,Nr ) with

C(N1 ,...,Nr ) := {(ν1 , . . . , νr ) ∈ Rr | ν1 > · · · > νr , νi + νr+1−i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , r}.

We denote by X(S, U, ν) the associated standard module and by L(S, U, ν) its
unique irreducible quotient, and we call ν the Hermitian parameter.
   Let WM be the Weyl group of M , and we set W = WG . We identify WM
with SN1 × · · · × SNr , embedded in W = SN as usual. Let w0 be the element
of maximal length in W and let w0,M be the element of minimal length in the
double coset WM w0 WM . Note that as w0 normalizes WM , we have WM w0 WM =
                         2
w0 WM = WM w0 and w0,M       = 1. Our identification of Ui with Ur+1−i then gives
                    ∼
an identification U = w0,M (U ).
   We fix the following isomorphism of HM -modules preserving unitary forms
                                               ∼
                         τ : Ur ⊡ · · · ⊡ U1 −→ U1 ⊡ · · · ⊡ Ur = U,
                             ur ⊗ · · · ⊗ u1 7→ u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ur
                                                                        ∼
Note that we can consider τ as an isomorphism w0,M (U ) −→ U .

6.2. We are now introducing elements following [BM3] 1.6 and 1.7: Fix w ∈ W
and let w = s1 . . . sl be a reduced decomposition. Then define ρw = ρ1 ρ2 . . . ρl
where ρi = tαi αi − 2r if si corresponds to the simple root αi . Using a result of
Lusztig ([Lu2] 5.2), it is shown in [BM3] 1.6 that ρw does not depend on the choice
of the reduced decomposition of w and that we have for all θ ∈ O
                                                       −1
(6.2.1)                                 θρw = ρw (w θ).

6.3. There is a unique O-linear map εM : HG → HM such that ε(tw ) = tw for
w ∈ WM and ε(tw ) = 0 for w ∈ W \ WM .
                     SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                            21

  We are now going to define an Hermitian form βS,U,ν on X(S, U, ν) as follows:
                                                                  1/2
Recall (2.2) that for each µ ∈ zS there exists a one-dimensional HM -module, i.e. a
                             1/2
C-algebra homomorphism HM → C which we denote by h 7→ h(ν).
  For w, w′ ∈ W and u, u′ ∈ U ⊗ Cν we set

              βS,U,ν (tw ⊗ u, tw′ ⊗ u′ ) = hε(tw′−1 tw ρw0,M )(ν)τ (u), u′ iU .

  This is well defined by (6.2.1).

6.4. The Hermitian form ( , ) on X(S, U, ν) defined by

                      (tw ⊗ u, tw′ ⊗ u′ ) = hε(tw′−1 tw )(ν)u, u′ iU

is unitary as we have
                               (tw ⊗ u, tw ⊗ u) = hu, uiU .

  Hence the signature character of βν can be computed as follows. Consider the
HG -linear map

  Aw0,M : X(S, U, ν) = HG ⊗HM (U ⊗ Cν ) → HG ⊗HM (U ⊗ C−ν ) = X(S, U, −ν),
                                        h ⊗ u 7→ hρw0,M ⊗ τ (u).

As C[WM ] acts trivially on Cν , source and target of Aw0,M are canonically isomor-
phic as C[W ]-modules, hence we can also consider Aw0,M as an endomorphism of a
C[W ]-module X, and for each λ ∈ Ŵ we get an induced endomorphism Aw0,M ,λ on
HomW (λ, X). We denote the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of
negative eigenvalues of Aw0,M ,λ by σλ (Aw0,M ) and set Σ(Aw0,M ) = (σλ (Aw0,M ))λ∈Ŵ .
Then we have
                                 Σ(Aw0,M ) = Σ(βν ).

Proposition. Assume that Aw0,M is nonzero. Then its image is isomorphic to
L(S, U, ν) and βν is up to a scalar the Hermitian form given by the involution ∗
(5.1).
Proof. : Let X ′ ⊂ X(S, U, ν) be the maximal submodule. Then we ave X/X ′ =
L(S, U, ν) (2.17). We have to show that the restriction A′ : X ′ → X(S, U, ν)h of
Aw0,M to X ′ is always zero. As X(S, U, ν) has a unique irreducible quotient, namely
L(S, U, ν), X(S, U, ν)h has a unique irreducible submodule, namely L(S, U, ν)h
which is isomorphic to L(S, U, ν) as L(S, U, ν) is Hermitian. As X(S, U, ν)h is
of finite length, the image of A′ has to contain this unique irreducible submodule
if A′ is nonzero. This would imply that X ′ has a subquotient which is isomor-
phic to L(S, U, ν) but this is a contradiction to the fact that L(S, U, ν) occurs with
multiplicity one in X(S, U, ν). 

7. Reducibility walls

7.1. We keep the notations from (6.1).
                                                                           1/2
   For fixed S und U we call ν ∈ C(N1 ,...,Nr ) irreducible if the HGLN -module
                                         0
X(S, U, ν) is irreducible and denote by C(N1 ,...,Nr )
                                                       the set of irreducible ν.
                                                         1/2
     Every irreducible Hermitian irreducible HGLN -module V defines a signature
character Σ(V ) ∈ ZŴ (5.6). We obtain a map

                                C(N1 ,...,Nr ) → ZŴ ,
                                           ν 7→ Σ(L(S, U, ν)).
                                                         0
     By (6.3) and (6.4) this map is locally constant on C(N1 ,...,Nr )
                                                                       .

7.2. Write L(S, U, ν) = L(∆1 , . . . , ∆s ) (2.13). Note that the number and the length
of the segments do not depend on ν. The standard module X(S, U, ν) is irreducible
if and only if no two of the segments can be linked. Hence the reducibility locus,
                       0
i.e. C(N1 ,...,Nr ) \ C(N1 ,...,Nr )
                                     , is a union of hyperplanes of the form

                         Hα = {ν ∈ C(N1 ,...,Nr ) | hα, ν + χi = 1}

where α ∈ R+ runs through a certain set of positive roots (cf. (9.4)) and where χ
is the central character of the tempered representation U .

7.3. We make this more concrete in the case of an unramified representations, i.e.
for the case S = ∅ and hence U the trivial representation. In this case all segments
have length 1 and ν = (ν1 , . . . , νN ) is irreducible if and only if hν, αi =
                                                                              6 1 for all
      +
α ∈ R , i.e. νi − νj 6= 1 for all i < j.
   For every root α ∈ R+ we define the corresponding reducibility wall

                               Hα = {ν ∈ CN | hα, νi = 1}.

  Set M = [N/2]. Via (ν1 , . . . , νN ) 7→ (ν1 , . . . , νM ) we can identify CN with DM
where
             DM = {(x1 , . . . , xM ) ∈ RM | x1 > · · · > xM > 0}.
    Via this identification the reducibility walls can be described as follows. Assume
first that N is even. Here we have that all nonempty reducibility walls are the
following:

            ±
           Hij = {(x1 , · · · , xM ) ∈ DM | xi ± xj = 1},        for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ M

and

                                                     1
          Hi, 21 = {(x1 , · · · , xM ) ∈ DM | xi =     },        for 1 ≤ i ≤ M .
                                                     2
                    SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                               23

For N odd, we have in addition to the walls above those of the form

        Hj,1 = {(x1 , · · · , xM ) ∈ DM | xj = ±1},         for 1 ≤ j ≤ M .
   We will give a description of the reducibility walls in terms of the roots, namely,
we will determine a subset of the set of roots such that each reducibility plane is
determined by one element in this subset. The first easy remark is that
                                     Hα+ = H−α
                                            −

                                            +
                                     Hα− = H−α
for any α in the root lattice. Denote by
     K = {α±
           i,j = ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N } ∪ {αi = ei − eN−i+1 | i = 1, · · · , M }
                           ∪ {αi,M = ei − eM +1 | i = 1, · · · , M }.
   We have a one to one correspondance between the set of all vanishing walls
                                   ±
and elements in K, namely Hi,j       maps to α±  i,j , and also between each Hi, 21 to
                                                                       ±
αi = ei − eN−i+1 , if N is even. Now if N is odd, we also have that Hj,1 corresponds
to αi,M = ei − eM +1 .
   We have the following trivial intersection rules for the walls:
          −     −        −     −      +     +        +     +
   (1) Hij   ∩ Hik = Hik   ∩ Hjk  = Hij ∩ Hik = Hik    ∩ Hjk  = ∅.
          +     +
   (2) Hij ∩ Hjk = ∅.
          +     −
   (3) Hij  ∩ Hij  = ∅.
   (4) Hi, 2 ∩ Hj, 21 = Hi,1 ∩ Hj,1 = ∅.
           1

          +     −
   (5) Hij  ∩ Hjk   = ∅.
          −               −
   (6) Hij ∩ Hi, 21 = Hij   ∩ Hi,1 = ∅.
          +               +             +              +
   (7) Hij ∩ Hi, 21 = Hij ∩ Hj, 12 = Hij  ∩ Hi,1 = Hij   ∩ Hj,1 = ∅.
  Now let R′ ⊂ R+ be a set of positive roots. We set
                                        \
                               H R′ =       Hα .
                                           α∈R′

Proposition. Let R′ ⊂ R+ be such that HR′ consists of a single point ν =
(ν1 , . . . , νN ). Then L(ν) is unitary.
Proof. Let J ⊂ R′ be a minimal subset such that HJ = HR′ . In particular we have
#J = M . We say that two walls H and H ′ in J are equivalent if there exist walls
H = H0 , H1 , . . . , Hr−1 , Hr = H ′ in J such that the set of indices for S
                                                                            the wall Hk
has nonempty intersection with the set of indices of Hk+1 . Let J = Jα be the
decomposition into equivalence classes with respect to this relation. Jα has to be a
set of walls of one of the following forms:
     (i) Jα = {Hi−1 ,i2 , Hi−2 ,i3 , . . . , Hi−m−1 ,im }.
    (ii) Jα = {Hi−1 ,i2 , Hi−2 ,i3 , . . . , Hi−m−1 ,im , Him , 12 }.
   (iii) Jα = {Hi−1 ,i2 , Hi−2 ,i3 , . . . , Hi−m−1 ,im , Him ,1 }.
   (iv) Jα = {Hi−1 ,i2 , Hi−2 ,i3 , . . . , Hi−m−1 ,im , Hi+m ,im+1 }.

                       P
   As we have #J =        #Jα = M = #{indices of walls occuring in J}, in Jα have
to be #Jα indices, and this means that only the cases (ii) and (iii) are possible. As
the νi are pairwise different, each of the cases (ii) and (iii) can occur only once. Now
it follows from Tadič’s description of unitary representations (5.4) that L(∅, 1, ν)
has to be unitary. 


8. Signature at Infinity

8.1. Recall from (7.1) that the signature character is constant on the connected
                  0
components of C(N    1 ,...,Nr )
                                 . It is easy to see that there is a unique connected com-
                 0
ponent C∞ of C(N    1 ,...,Nr )
                                 such that for all roots α ∈ Π \ S the set of real numbers
{ν(α) | ν ∈ C} is not bounded. In this section we want to describe the signature of
X(S, U, ν) = L(S, U, ν) for ν ∈ C∞ . For this we follow Barbasch and Moy [BM3].

8.2. As a W -module we have X(S, U, ν) ∼= C[W ]⊗C[WM ] U . Let ε : C[W ] → C[WM ]
be the C-linear map with ε(tw ) = tw for w ∈ WM and ε(tw ) = 0 for w ∈ W \ WM
and define a C[W ]-invariant Hermitian form on X(S, U, ν) by

                 β∞ (tw ⊗ u, tw′ ⊗ u′ ) = hε(tw′−1 tw tw0,M )τ (u), u′ iU .


As in (5.5) this defines a signature character Σ∞ ∈ ZŴ which depends only on S
und U .
   A limit argument using (7.1) (cf. [BM3] 2.3) shows that for ν ∈ C∞ the signature
character of βν and the signature character of β∞ coincide. Hence we get that for
ν ∈ C∞ the class of Σ∞ in ZŴ /{±1} is equal to the class of the signature of βν in
ZŴ /{±1}.

8.3. To calculate the signature character of β∞ we make the following general
remark. Let (V, h , i) be any finite-dimensional complex unitary space and f ∈
End(V ) be a self adjoint endomorphism (in particular f is semisimple). We define
a Hermitian form βf on V by

                                  βf (v, v ′ ) = hf v, v ′ i.

This form is non-degenerate iff f is invertible and in this case its signature is equal
to
            #{positive eigenvalues of f } − #{negative eigenvalues of f }

where we count eigenvalues with multiplicity. Now assume further that f 2 = idV .
Then f has only eigenvalues +1 or −1, and the signature of βf is nothing but Tr(f ).

8.4. Let us apply this to the unitary form htw ⊗ u, tw′ ⊗ u′ i = hε(tw′−1 tw )u, u′ iU
on X(S, U, ν) and to f = rw0,M given by

                          rw0,M : tw ⊗ u 7→ tw tw0,M ⊗ τ (u).

Then it follows that Σ∞ = (σ∞,λ ) ∈ ZŴ with

(8.4.1)                    σ∞,λ = dim(λ)−1 Tr(rw0,M |Xλ )

where dim(λ) denotes the complex dimension of the irreducible W -representation
corresponding to λ ∈ Ŵ and Xλ denotes the λ-isotypical component of the left
W -module X = X(S, U, ν).
   Now let χλ be the character on W corresponding to the irreducible representation
λ. The projection pλ from X onto its isotypical component Xλ is given by

                                   dim(λ) X
                        t ⊗ u 7→            χλ (w)(wt ⊗ u).
                                    #W
                                         w∈W


Hence if we define for w ∈ W a C-linear endomorphism f w of X by

                              t ⊗ u 7→ wtw0,M ⊗ τ (u),

we have

                        σ∞,λ = dim(λ)−1 Tr(pλ ◦ rw0,M )
                                        X
                             = (#W )−1      χλ (w) Tr(f w ).
                                          w∈W


  For z ∈ W let ℓz : X → X be the left multiplication with z. Then we have

                                                       −1
                               ℓz ◦ f w ◦ ℓ−1
                                           z = f
                                                 zwz
                                                     .

In particular we see that Tr(f w ) depends only on the conjugacy class of w. Identi-
fying conjugacy classes in W with irreducible representations of W , we get
                                       X
(8.4.2)             σ∞,λ = (#W )−1            N (µ)χλ (µ) Tr(f w(µ) )
                                       µ∈Ŵ


where N (µ) is the number of elements of W in the conjugacy class µ and where
w(µ) is some element in µ.

8.5. It remains to calculate the trace of f w . Let [W/WM ] be a system of repre-
sentatives in W of the quotient W/WM . As a C-vector space, X is isomorphic to
L
   w∈[W/WM ] Ctw ⊗ U . Hence

                                            X
(8.5.1)                 Tr(f w ) =                        Tr(z −1 wzw0,M τ |U ).
                                         z∈[W/WM ],
                                      z −1 wzw0,M ∈WM




   It remains to determine for x = (x1 , . . . , xr ) ∈ WM = SN1 × . . . SNr the trace
of the endomorphism u 7→ xτ (u) of U . For this we set Ui′ = Ui ⊗ Ur+1−i for
                               ′
i = 1, . . . , [r/2] and also U(r+1)/2 = U(r+1)/2 if r is odd. Then we have

                                     U = U1′ ⊗ · · · ⊗ U[(r+1)/2]
                                                        ′



and the endomorphism xτ |U is the tensor product of the endomorphisms x′i τi |Ui′
where x′i = (xi , xr+1−i ) (and x′[(r+1)/2] = x′[(r+1)/2] if r is odd) and τi is the endo-
morphism of Ui′ which switches the two components (and is the identity on U(r+1)/2  ′

if r is odd). Therefore we have

                                                [(r+1)/2]
                                                    Y
(8.5.2)                         Tr(xτ |U ) =                 Tr(x′i τi |Ui′ ).
                                                    i=1


8.6. Hence we are reduced to the following situation: For an integer M ≥ 1 let V
be a finite-dimensional SM -module und set U = V ⊗ V . For (x1 , x2 ) ∈ SM × SM
we want to determine the trace of ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) ◦ τ with

                                        τ : v1 ⊗ v2 →7 v2 ⊗ v1 ,
                                ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) : v1 ⊗ v2 →7 x1 v1 ⊗ x2 v2 .

     We claim that                                  X
                            Tr(ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) ◦ τ ) =           [V : λ]χλ (x1 x2 ).
                                                    λ∈ŜM

  First note that if we have a decomposition of SM -modules V = V ′ ⊕ V ′′ , a
concrete matrix multiplication shows that

Tr((ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) ◦ τ )|(V ⊗ V )) = Tr((ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) ◦ τ )|(V ′ ⊗ V ′ )) + Tr((ℓ(x1 ,x2 ) ◦ τ )|(V ′′ ⊗ V ′′ )).

Therefore we can assume that the SM -module V is irreducible, say of isomorphism
class λ ∈ ŜM . Of course, then we know that the trace of left multiplication with
x1 x2 on V is simply χλ (x1 x2 ). Hence the claim follows if we prove the following
lemma:
                     SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                                 27

Lemma. Let k be a field, let V be a finite-dimensional k-vector space and let f1
and f2 be two endomorphisms of V and let τ : V ⊗V → V ⊗V the map that switches
components. Then we have

                            Tr((f1 ⊗ f2 ) ◦ τ ) = Tr(f1 ◦ f2 ).


Proof. One easily reduces to the case that k is algebraically closed. Using the
fact that the set of semisimple endomorphisms is dense within the sapce all en-
domorphisms with respect to the Zariski topology, we can also assume that f1 is
semisimple. Choose a basis (ei ) of V such that f1 is given by a diagonal matrix A1
with respect to this basis. Denote
                              P     by A2 the matrix of f2 . Then the map (f ⊗f ′ ) ◦ τ
sends ei ⊗ ej toP
                (A1 )jj ej ⊗ ( l (A2 )li el ). Hence we see that the trace of (f1 ⊗ f2 ) ◦ τ
is nothing but i (A1 )ii (A2 )ii which is the same as the trace of f1 ◦ f2 . 

8.7. In (8.4) we described an algorithm which reduced the computation of the
signature character of X(S, U, ν) for ν ∈ C∞ to the computation of the isomorphism
class of U as a C[WM ]-module (which we know by (4.3)) and the computation of
the characters of the symmetric group (which is well-known).
   In the case of unramified representations (i.e. where S is empty and U is the
trivial representation) we have:
Corollary. For unramified representations the signature character of β∞ is equal
to (σ∞,λ )λ∈Ŵ ∈ ZŴ with
                               σ∞,λ = χλ (w0 ).

Proof. This is a straight forward application of the algorithm above. Note that we
do not only have equality in ZŴ /{±1} but even in ZŴ as we have χ1 (w0 ) = 1. 


9. Wall crossing

9.1. We continue to use the notations of (6.1). Also denote by χ the central
character of U . Let (s, e) be a pair as in (2.4) corresponding to L(S, U, ν). We
can conjugate (s, e) such that s = χ + ν ∈ t. Note that the conjugacy class of e
depends only on S und U . Let RM ⊂ R be the root system of the Levi subroup
M . We further assume that we are not in the trivial case that the cone C(N1 ,...,Nr )
of Hermitian parameters is empty.
   The tempered representations Ui are of the form L(∆i1 , . . . , ∆iri ) where ∆ij =
∆(−(mij − 1)/2, mij ) is a segment with center 0. We order these segments such that
j 7→ mij is nonincreasing.
   Let ∆1 , . . . , ∆m be a tuple of segments such that L(∆1 , . . . , ∆m ) = L(S, U, ν).
We call the number of pairs (∆i , ∆j ) such that ∆i precedes ∆j the height of ν.
Hence ν is irreducible if and only if the height of ν is zero. For every reducibility
wall H the height of ν ∈ H is constant equal to some positive integer height(H)
28                             C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

outside those points that lie on an intersection of H with some other reducibility
wall. We call height(H) the height of the reducibility wall.
   Our goal in this chapter is to cross these walls. More precisely let ν0 be a
Hermitian parameter, such that there exists a unique reducibility wall H with
ν0 ∈ H. Then we can find a small positive real number ε and a non constant map

                             (−ε, ε) → C(N1 ,...,Nr ) ,   t 7→ ν(t)

which is the restriction of an affine map R → RN such that
      (i) ν(0) = ν0 .
     (ii) ν(t) is irreducible for all t 6= 0.
  Then for t > 0 (resp. t < 0), the signature character of L(S, U, ν(t)) is constant
and we call it Σ+ (resp. Σ− ). The goal of this chapter is to find an expression for
Σ+ + Σ− and for Σ− − Σ+ .

9.2. To do this we use a filtration which is called in [Vo] 3 the Jantzen filtration:
Let H be a C-algebra with a complex antilinear involution ∗ and let E be a left H-
module which is a finite dimensional C-vector space. Let βt be a real analytic family
of Hermitian forms on E defined for small real t such that βt (hx, y) = βt (x, h∗ y)
for all h ∈ H, x, y ∈ E. Assume that βt is non-degenerate for t 6= 0. Then there is
a unique sequence of subspaces

                              E = E 0 ⊃ E 1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ E n = (0)

such that the meromorphic familiy of Hermitian forms βti = t1i βt (x, y)|E i can be
extended to an analytic family of Hermitian forms on E i and such that the radical
of β0i is equal to E i+1 . In particular β0i induces a non-degenerate pairing β i on
gri (E) = E i /E i+1 .
    Explicitly E i can be defined as

     E i = {x ∈ E | βt (x, y) vanishes at least to order i at t = 0, for any y ∈ E}.

   Note that our definition of the E i varies a little bit from the definition given
in loc. cit., but it is easily seen that both definitions are equivalent. Moreover it
follows from the definition that the E i are also H-submodules of E and that βti are
Hermitian with respect to the involution ∗ .
   Let σ i be the signature of β i , and denote by σ + (resp. σ − ) the signature of βt
for small positive (resp. negative) t. Then we have (loc. cit.)
                                                    X
                                  σ+ − σ− = 2               σi,
                                                  i≥1 odd
                                                    X
                                  σ+ + σ− = 2                σi.
                                                  i≥0 even

9.3. Now let h , i be a fixed unitary form on E and let ft : E → E be the analytic
family of selfadjoint endomorphisms such that βt (x, y) = hft (x), yi. Then det(ft )
is non-zero for t 6= 0 and the analytic map t 7→ det(ft ) has a zero of order
                   X                                X
                       i(dim(E i ) − dim(E i−1 )) =   i dim(gri (E))
                 i>0                             i>0

in t = 0.

9.4. Let Ōe be the closure of the orbit of e in N (s) = {n ∈ g | [s, n] = n}
under the action of ZG (s). For all ν we define Rν as the set of roots α ∈ R+ such
that gα ⊂ N (s) and such that there exists a nonzero element eα ∈ gα such that
e + eα ∈/ Ōe . These are those roots which “link” segments of X(S, U, ν). We have
Rν = ∅ if and only if ν is irreducible. If ν lies on a unique reducibilty wall H, Rν
is independent of ν, and we call it RH .
    Then for all α ∈ RH , sgn(α(ν(t) + χ) − 1) is independent of α ∈ RH and we have
sgn(α(ν(t) + χ) − 1) = − sgn(α(ν(−t) + χ) − 1) for all t ∈ (−ε, ε). After a possible
substitution of t 7→ −t we can and will from now on assume that sgn(α(ν(t) + χ) −
1)) = sgn(t).

9.5. Let H be a reducibility wall of height one and fix t 7→ ν(t) as above. We write
L(S, U, ν(0)) as L(M) where M is a multiset of segments ∆1 , . . . , ∆m . As H is of
height one, there exists a unique pair (∆i , ∆j ) of segments, such that ∆i precedes
∆j . We denote M′ the multiset consisting of the segments ∆l for l 6= i, j and the
segments ∆i ∩ ∆j and ∆i ∪ ∆j . By (2.13) and (2.17) we have an exact sequence
(9.5.1)                 0 → L(M′ ) → X(M) → L(M) → 0
and L(M′ ) is again Hermitian, and we have L(M′ ) = X(M′ ) otherwise ν(0) would
not lie on a unique reducibility wall.
  We now apply (9.2) to E = X(ν(t)) which as a C[W ]-module does not depend
on t and its Hermitian form βt . It is of the form
             X(ν(t)) = E 0 ' L(M′ ) = E 1 = · · · = E ω ' (0) = E ω+1
for some ω ≥ 1, and we have
                                gr0 (E) = L(ν(0)).
As L(M′ ) is an irreducible module, its signature character has to be equal to the
signature character of βω up to a sign ε.
   If we set Σ+ = limt→0+ Σ(L(S, U, ν(t))) and Σ− = limt→0− Σ(L(S, U, ν(t))) we
will therefore have
                       
             +    −      2Σ(L(S, U, ν(0))),                 if ω is odd,
           Σ +Σ =                                     ′
                         2Σ(L(S, U, ν(0))) + 2εΣ(L(M )), if ω is even,
                       
             +    −      2εΣ(L(M′ )), if ω is odd,
           Σ −Σ =
                         0,             if ω is even.
30                          C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

   Hence if ω is even, the signature characters on both sides of the wall are equal. If
ω is odd, we can calculate Σ+ (resp. Σ− ) if we know Σ(L(M′ )) and Σ− (resp. Σ+ )
as this allows us also to calculate ε: By (4.3) we know that the sign representation
occurs with multiplicity one in X(S, U, ν(t)) for all t and L(M′ ). Hence the equality

                        (Σ+ )sgn − (Σ− )sign = 2εΣ(L(M′ ))sgn

implies that we have (Σ+ )sgn = −(Σ− )sign and

                              ε = Σ(L(M′ ))sgn (Σ+ )sgn .

9.6. In fact we conjecture the following:
Conjecture for reducibility walls of height one. We always have the ω is
odd. Hence

                              Σ+ − Σ− = ε2Σ(L(M′ )),
                              Σ+ + Σ− = 2Σ(L(M)).

with ε = Σ(L(M′ ))sgn (Σ+ )sgn = −Σ(L(M′ ))sgn (Σ− )sgn .

9.7. Now let H be a reducibility wall of height two and again fix t 7→ ν(t) as above.
We write L(S, U, ν(0)) as L(M) where M is a multiset of segments ∆1 , . . . , ∆m . Now
there exist two pairs (∆i1 , ∆j1 ) and (∆i2 , ∆j2 ) of segments, such that ∆ik precedes
∆jk for k = 1, 2. We can assume that ∆j2 does not precede ∆i1 . Note that it is
possible that ∆j1 precedes ∆i2 . We denote M1 (resp. M2 , resp. M′ ) the multiset of
segments which we get from M by linking (∆i1 , ∆j1 ) (resp. (∆i2 , ∆j2 ), resp. both
(∆i1 , ∆j1 ) and (∆i2 , ∆j2 ).
   By (2.17) we know that L(M) is the unique irreducible quotient of X(M), L(M′ )
is the unique irreducible submodule of X(M) and that the other irreducible sub-
quotients of X(M) are isomorphic to L(M1 ) and L(M2 ). We assume that L(M1 )
and L(M2 ) both occur with multiplicity one X(M). The standard modules satisfy
the inclusions X(M′ ) ⊂ X(Mi ) ⊂ X(M) for i = 1, 2. L(M′ ) = X(M′ ) is the
unique irreducible submodule of X(M), we have exact sequences

                       0 → L(M′ ) → X(Mi ) → L(Mi ) → 0,

and L(M) = X(M)/(X(M1) + X(M2 )).
   Further L(M′ ) is Hermitian and as ν(0) lies only on a unique reducibility wall,
we have L(M′ ) = X(M′ ). L(M1 ) is non-Hermitian, its Hermitian dual is L(M2 ).
   Again we apply (9.2) to E = X(M) with its family of Hermitian forms βt . As
the Hermitian forms induced on the graded pieces of the Jantzen filtration are
non-degenerate, it follows that the Jantzen filtration will be of the form

                X(M) = E 0 ' X(M1 ) + X(M2 ) = E 1 = · · · = E ω1
                             ' X(M′ ) = E ω1 +1 = · · · = E ω2
                             ' (0) = E ω2 +1
                     SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                             31

for integers ω2 ≥ ω1 > 0. Here ω2 = ω1 means that only L(M) and X(M1 )+X(M2 )
occur as graded pieces in the filtration.
   If ω2 > ω1 , the signature character of the form β ω2 induced on the irreducible
module grω2 (E) = L(M′ ) is equal to the signature character of L(M′ ) up to a sign
ε.
   Again we can use (9.2) to compute difference and sum of limt→0+ Σ(L(S, U, ν(t)))
and limt→0− Σ(L(S, U, ν(t))) in terms of Σ(L(M)), Σ(L(M′ )) and Σ(L(M1 ) ⊕
L(M2 )). Note that the last signature is zero as L(M1 ) and L(M2 ) are dual to
each other.

9.8. We now consider wall crossing in the unramified case. Hence from now on
we assume that S is empty. Hermitian representations are then given by elements
ν ∈ C(1,...,1) = {(νi ) ∈ RN | νi + νN+1−i = 0}. For simplicity we write X(ν) for the
corresponding standard module and L(ν) for its unique irreducible quotient.
   We now consider the HG -linear homomorphism

                               Aw0 : h ⊗ 1 7→ hρw0 ⊗ 1
                                                    Q
defined
      Q in (6.4). As the leading term of ρw0 is tw0 α∈R+ α, Aw0 is nonzero as we
have α∈R+ hα, νi =   6 0. Hence we can calculate the signature character of L(ν)
using the form βν defined in (6.3). If we write w0 = sk sk−1 . . . s1 as a product of
simple reflections, we get a decomposition Aw0 = Tk ◦ Tk−1 ◦ · · · ◦ T1 where Ti is an
HG -linear map

                   Ti : HG ⊗HT Csi−1 ...s1 (ν) → HG ⊗HT Csi ...s1 (ν) .

Source and target of each Ti are canonically isomorphic as C[W ]-modules and hence
we can consider Ti as an endomorphism of C[W ]-modules.
   For each simple root α ∈ Π we define the Levi subgroup Gα of G by Lie(Gα ) =
t ⊕ gα ⊕ g−α . If the simple reflection si corresponds to the simple root αi , Ti can
be written as idHG ⊗Tiαi with

                Tiαi : HGαi ⊗HT Csi−1 ...s1 (ν) → HGαi ⊗HT Csi ...s1 (ν) ,
                                        h ⊗ 1 7→ h(tαi αi − 1) ⊗ 1.

Similarly as above we can consider Tiαi as an endomorphism of C[S2 ]-modules.
Further by (4.3) we know source and target are isomorphic to C[S2 ] = sign ⊕1. An
easy calculation shows that Tiαi acts on sign by the scalar 1 − hαi , si−1 . . . s1 (ν)i
and on 1 by the scalar −1 − hαi , si−1 . . . s1 (ν)i.

9.9. Now fix a reducibility wall H and a map t 7→ ν(t) as above using the
normalization in (9.4). We necessarily have RH = {α0 , −w0 (α0 )} for some α0 ∈ R+ ,
in particular the height of H is at most 2.
   We apply the discussion in (9.8) to ν = ν(t) and get Aw0 (t). For t = 0 we see
that Tiαi (and hence Ti ) is invertible for all i except for

                        i ∈ JH := {j | s1 s2 . . . sj−1 αj ∈ RH }.
32                           C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

Further for i ∈ JH , Tiαi acts on the 1-component by the scalar

                               −hαi , si−1 . . . s1 (ν(t))i − 1

which is equal to −2 at t = 0 and it acts on the sign-component by the scalar

                                hαi , si−1 . . . s1 (ν(t))i − 1

which is a linear function of t, in particular its vanishing order is 1.

9.10. We keep the notation of (9.8) and assume that we are in the situation of
(9.5), in particular H is a reducibility wall of height one and JH consists of a single
element j. By the arguments above we have that

                     ordt=0 det(Aw0 (t)) = dim L(M′ ) = dim E 1 .

Hence it follows from (9.3) that ω = 1. We will also show that in this case we
always have ε = −1. Let λ ∈ Ŵ be the maximal element occuring in L(M′ ). As
the multiplicty of λ in L(M′ ) is 1, the signature of the Hermitian form induced by
β1 on the one-dimensional space V = HomŴ (λ, L(M′ )) is equal to ±1. We have to
show that it is equal to −1.
   By the definition we have to show that the derivative of the function

                            ρ : t 7→ 1 − hαj , sj−1 . . . s1 (ν(t))i

is negative in t = 0. As this is a linear function it suffices to show that sgn(ρ(t)) =
− sgn(t). By definition of ν(t) (9.4), we have sgn(hα, ν(t)i − 1) = sgn(t) for the
unique α ∈ RH . By (9.9) we have α = s1 s2 . . . sj−1 αj . Hence we see that

                     sgn(ρ(t)) = − sgn(hαj , sj−1 . . . s1 (ν(t))i − 1)
                                = − sgn(hα, ν(t)i)
                                = − sgn(t).

     Hence we get:
9.11. Theorem. For unramified representations and for ν(0) lying in a reducibil-
ity wall of height one, we have

                     lim Σ(βν(t) ) + lim Σ(βν(t) ) = 2Σ(L(ν(0))),
                     t→0−              t→0+
                     lim Σ(βν(t) ) − lim Σ(βν(t) ) = 2Σ(L(M′ )).
                     t→0−              t→0+



9.12. Note that we also have

                             Σ(L(ν(0))) = Σ(L(M′ )) ⊗ sgn

as L(ν(0)) is the Zelevinsky dual of L(M′ ) (4.4).
                      SIGNATURE OF p-ADIC REPRESENTATIONS                                 33

9.13. We keep the notation of (9.9) and assume that we are in the situation of
(9.7), in particular H is a reducibility wall of height two and JH consists of two
elements j1 and j2 .
   If we set m := #W , we have dim(X(M)) = m and it follows from (9.9) that

                                ordt=0 det(Aw0 (t)) = m.

   If we define ω1 and ω2 as in (9.7), we have by (9.3)

            m = ω1 dim(X((M )1 ) + X((M )2 )) + (ω2 − ω1 ) dim(X(M′ ).

   There exist two pairs (i1 , j1 ) and (i2 , j2 ) of indices such that νjk (0) − νik (0) = 1
for k = 1, 2. We can assume that i1 < i2 . We distinguish the cases j1 6= i2 and
j1 = i2 .
   By (4.3) we have in the first case (resp. in the second case)

                         dim(X(Mi)) = m/2,         dim(X(M′ )) = m/4
                 (resp. dim(X(Mi)) = m/2,          dim(X(M′ )) = m/6)

and it follows that
                                       3              1
                                 m = ω1 m + (ω2 − ω1 ) m
                                       4              4
                                       5              1
                          (resp. m = ω1 m + (ω2 − ω1 ) m).
                                       6              6
As ω2 ≥ ω1 are positive integers, this implies in both cases

                                   ω1 = 1,       ω2 = 2.

   Therefore (9.2) implies

                        Σ− + Σ+ = 2Σ(L(ν(0))) + ε2Σ(L(M′ ))

where

                                   Σ+ = lim Σ(βν(t) ),
                                          t→0+
                                     −
                                   Σ = lim Σ(βν(t) ).
                                          t→0−

  Moreover it also follows that Σ− − Σ+ is nothing but two times the signature
character of L(M1 ) ⊕ L(M2 ) which is zero as those two modules are Hermitian
duals of each other.
  Similarly as in (9.5) this implies

                  ε = (Σ+ )sign Σ(L(M′ ))sgn = (Σ− )sign Σ(L(M′ ))sgn .

   Hence we get:

9.14. Theorem. For unramified representations and for ν(0) lying in a reducibil-
ity wall of height two, we have

                      Σ+ − Σ− = 0,
                      Σ+ + Σ− = 2Σ(L(ν(0))) + ε2Σ(L(M′ ))
                                   = 2(Σ(L(M′ )) ⊗ sign +εΣ(L(M′ )))

where
                   ε = (Σ+ )sign Σ(L(M′ ))sgn = (Σ− )sign Σ(L(M′ ))sgn .


9.15. Again we have
                                Σ(L(ν(0))) = Σ(L(M′ )) ⊗ sgn

as L(ν(0)) is the Zelevinsky dual of L(M′ ).


10. Signature character for unramified representations

10.1. We will now give a conjectural inductive procedure the calculate the signa-
ture character for unramified representations.
   For this we consider Bernstein-Zelevinsky parameter giving rise to standard an
                                1/2
irreducible representations of HGLN of the following form: If N is even, we set for
0 ≤ m ≤ N/2 and real numbers ν1 > · · · > νm > 0:

                                                1 1             1 1
            MN
             ν1 ,...,νm := (ν1 , . . . , νm , [− , ], . . . , [− , ], −νm , . . . , −ν1 ).
                                              | 2 2 {z          2 2}
                                                  N/2−m times


If N is odd, we set for 0 ≤ mleq(N − 1)/2

                                               1 1             1 1
           MN
            ν1 ,...,νm := (ν1 , . . . , νm , [− , ], . . . , [− , ], 0, −νm , . . . , −ν1 ).
                                             | 2 2 {z          2 2}
                                              (N−1)/2−m times


     We conjecture the following:

Conjecture. : Assume that X(MN                                             N
                                    ν1 ,...,νm ) is irreducible. Then Σ(X(Mν1 ,...,νm ))
depends only on the cardinality of {νi | νi > 12 }.

     It follows from (9.14) that the conjecture is true in the unramified case.

10.2. From now on we will assume that the conjectures (9.6) and (10.1) hold.
In particular the following is well-defined: For integers N ≥ 1, 0 ≤ m ≤ N/2 and
0 ≤ r ≤ (N − 2m)/2 we set

                                ΣN (m, r) := Σ(X(MN
                                                  ν1 ,...,νm ))


where ν1 > . . . νr > 12 > νr+1 > · · · > νm .
   Let e be the partition (2m , 1N−2m ) of N . Further let S be the set of simple roots
corresponding to the ordered partition
                      
                          (1N/2−m , m, 1N/2−m ),                  if N is even,
               λ :=
                          (1(N−1)/2−m , m + 1, 1(N−1)/2−m ), if N is odd.

and let U be the tempered representation of the standard Levi subgroup corre-
sponding to λ which is given due to the Bernstein-Zelevinsky classification by

                                      1 1             1 1

                                         N/2−m times


if N is even and by

                                      1 1             1 1

                                         N/2−m times


if N is odd.
Proposition. For r = 0 and r = m we can calculate ΣN (m, r) as follows:
   (1) For d ∈ ŜN we have

                                     ΣN (m, 0)d = Kdt ,e .

   (2) Let Σ∞ (S, U ) the signature at infinity (8.2) corresponding to (S, U ). Then
       we have
                              ΣN (m, m) = Σ∞ (S, U ).

                                                                          1
Proof. By (5.3) we know that X(MN     ν1 ,...,νm ) is unitary if all νi < 2 . Hence (1)
follows from (4.3).
   By (10.1) ΣN (m, m) is nothing but the signature at infinity with respect to
(S, U ). Therefore we know that the classes of ΣN (m, m) and Σ∞ (S, U ) in ZŴ /{±1}
are equal. A calculation using the algorithm in (8.4) then gives equality even in
ZŴ . 
36                              C. BOYALLIAN, T. WEDHORN

10.3. By (9.6) we have the equality

                   ΣN (m, r − 1) − ΣN (m, r) = 2ΣN (m + 1, r − 1).

     By induction this implies for 0 ≤ k ≤ r

                                      k
                                      X   
                       N                  k N  i
                     Σ (m, r) =     (−2)    Σ (m + i, r − k).
                                i=0
                                          i

In particular:
Proposition. For N , m and r as above:
                                         r
                                         X   
                            N                r N       i
                        Σ (m, r) =     (−2)     Σ (m + i, 0)
                                   i=0
                                             i

which allows us to calculate ΣN (m, r) as we know the right hand side by (10.2).

10.4. As we know not only the signature charackter of unitary modules but also
of representations at infinity, our conjectures implies in particular: Let w0 ∈ SN be
the longest element and let λ be a partition of N . Set r = [N/2]. Then we have by
(10.3) and (8.7):
                                       r
                                       X         

11. Examples

11.1. We conclude with the calculation of signature characters of GLN for N =
2, 3, 4. Each time we will classify irreducible HGLN -representations by the Lang-
lands data (S, U, ν).
     We will describe S be the corresponding ordered partition (σ1 , . . . , σr ) of N . As
we consider only Hermitian modules, we always have that σi = σr+1−i .
     The tempered representation U of GLσ1 × · · · × GLσr is a tensor product of
irreducible tempered representations Ui of GLσi and each Ui will be described by
its Bernstein-Zelevinsky datum. The condition of being Hermitian implies that
Ui ∼ = Ur+1−i .
     Finally ν will be considered as an r-tuple of real numbers (ν1 , . . . , νr ) with ν1 >
· · · > νr . We have νi + νr+1−i = 0 because of the property of being Hermitian.
     If (S, U, ν) is a Langlands datum, we denote by M(S, U, ν) the corresponding
Bernstein-Zelevinsky datum.

11.2. We now consider the case GL2 .
   S = (2), U = ([− 21 , 21 ]): In this case we necessarily have ν = (0) and M(S, U, ν) =
([− 21 , 21 ]) and X(S, U, ν) is irreducible (2.13) and is unitary (5.3). Hence by (4.3):

                              Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = (12 ) = sgn .

   S = (2), U = (0, 0): Again ν is (0), X(S, U, ν) is irreducible and unitary, hence

                         Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = (12 ) + (2) = sgn +1.

   S = (1, 1): U is necessarily (0) ⊗ (0), and ν is of the form (ν1 , −ν1 ) with ν1 > 0.
We have M(S, U, ν) = (ν1 , −ν1 ) and X(S, U, ν) is irreducible if and only if ν1 6= 21 .
For ν1 < 21 , L(S, U, ν) is unitary, for ν1 > 21 , we are nearby infinity and can apply
(8.7). Alternatively we can use (9.11). Finally for ν1 = 12 we have L( 21 , − 21 ) =
ζ(L([− 21 , 12 ])) by (3.4). Hence we get
                                             2

                                (1 ) + (2, 1) + (3), U = (0, 0, 0).

   S = (1, 1, 1): We have U = (0) ⊗ (0) ⊗ (0) and ν = (ν1 , 0, −ν1 ). The standard
module X(S, U, ν) is irreducible for ν1 6= 21 , 1 and it is unitary for ν1 < 12 . At
ν1 = 12 we have a reducibility wall of height one and at ν1 = 1 a reducibility wall
of height two. Further we have L( 12 , 0, − 21 ) = ζ(L([− 21 , 21 ], 0)) and L(1, 0, −1) =
ζ(L([−1, 0, 1])). Hence we get

11.4. Finally consider N = 4:

     S = (4): We have ν = (0) and
                   4
                  
                   (1 ),                                           U = ([− 23 , − 21 , 21 , 23 ]),

                                                                   U = ([−1, 0, 1], 0),
     Σ(S, U, ν) =   (14 ) + (2, 12 ) + (22 ),                       U = ([− 21 , 21 ], [− 21 , 21 ]),
                  
                  
                   (14 ) + 2(2, 12 ) + (22 ) + (3, 1),
                                                                   U = ([− 12 , 21 ], 0, 0),
                  
                  
                   4
                    (1 ) + 3(2, 12 ) + 2(22 ) + 3(3, 1) + (4),      U = (0, 0, 0, 0).

     S = (2, 2), U = ([− 21 , 12 ]) ⊗ ([− 21 , 12 ]): We have ν = (ν1 , −ν1 ) and

                                   1      1          1      1
                   M(S, U, ν) = ([− + ν1 , + ν1 ], [− − ν1 , − ν1 ]).
                                   2      2          2      2
Hence X(S, U, ν) is reducible for ν1 = 21 and ν1 = 1, and both are reducibility
walls of height one. For ν1 < 21 , L(S, U, ν) is unitary and for ν1 > 1 we are nearby
infinity. Hence we can calculate both signature characters ((4.3) and (8.4)ff):
                                    4
                                     (1 ) + (2, 12 ) + (22 ), ν1 < 21 ,

                                     (14 ) − (2, 12 ) + (22 ), ν1 > 1.

For 12 < ν1 < 1 we can use the conjecture (9.6) to cross one of the reducibility
walls. Hence the conjecture implies in this case the following both equalities

                           ?                                   3 1 1 3
             Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = (14 ) − (2, 12 ) + (22 ) − 2Σ(L([− , − , , ])),
                                                               2 2 2 2
                              ?
             Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = (14 ) + (2, 12 ) + (22 ) − 2Σ(L([−1, 0, 1], 0)).
                                                                                                      1
The right hand sides coincide and we get conjecturally for ν = (ν1 , −ν1 ) and                        2   <
ν1 < 1:
                                   ?
                     Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = −(14 ) − (2, 12 ) + (22 ).
Finally we can now again use (9.6) to compute
                                         2

    S = (2, 2), U = (0, 0)⊗(0, 0): We have M(S, U, ν) = (ν1 , ν1 , −ν1 , −ν1 ) for ν1 > 0.
The only reducibility wall is at ν1 = 21 and it is of height 4. For ν1 < 12 we are
in the unitary case, for ν1 > 12 we are nearby infinity, and for ν1 = 21 we have
L( 12 , 21 , − 12 , − 21 ) = ζ(L([− 21 , 12 ], [− 21 , 21 ])). Hence:

                        4                                          1

For representations lying on a single reducibility wall we can use (9.11) if this wall
is of height one:
                                2      2                             1
                          (2, 1 ) + (2 ) + 2(3, 1) + (4), ν2 < ν1 = 2 ,
                         
                                                           1
         Σ(L(S, U, ν)) =   (22 ) + 0(3, 1) + (4),          2 = ν2 < ν1 < 32 ,
                         
                          2                               1         3

For representations lying on a single reducibility we use the Zelevinsky involution
if this wall is of height two:
                            
                              = (22 ) + (3, 1) + (4),  ν2 = 1 − ν1 < 21 ,
                            
                               ?
              Σ(L(S, U, ν)) =
                                −(22 ) + (3, 1) + (4), ν2 = ν1 − 1 < 12 ,
                            
                               = (22 ) − (3, 1) + (4),  ν2 = ν1 − 1 > 12 .

Finally there is a unique representation which lies on two reducibility walls, namely
L( 32 , 21 , − 12 , − 23 ) and this representation is unitary. It is the Zelevinsky dual of
L([− 23 , − 21 , 12 , 23 ]) and hence we have in this case

                                    Σ(L(S, U, ν)) = (4).
