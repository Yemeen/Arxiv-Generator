                                                    Abstract. For o(2n + 1), in addition to the conventional set of orthogonal polynomials,
                                                    another set is produced with the help of the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2n). Difficulties related
                                                    with expression of Dyson’s constant for the Lie superalgebras are discussed.




                                                                                      §0. Introduction
                                             0.1. History. In 1962 while studying statistical mechanics Dyson [D] considered the con-
                                             stant term in the expression
                                                                             Y        xi
                                                                                  (1 − ) for k ∈ N,
                                                                             i6=j
                                                                                      xj

                                             depending on indeterminates x1 , . . . , xn . Dyson conjectured the explicit form of this constant
                                             term. His conjecture was soon related with the root system of sl(n), generalized to other
                                             root systems of simple Lie algebras and proved. The expressions obtained for the Dyson
                                             constant are called Macdonald’s identities, see [M].
                                                Let us briefly recall the main results. Let g be a simple (finite dimensional) Lie algebra,
                                             R its root system, P the group of weights; A = C[P ] the group of formal exponents of the
                                             form eλ , where λ ∈ P ; let W be the Weyl group of g and
                                                                                           1 Y
                                                                                   △=             (1 − eα ).
                                                                                          |W | α∈R

                                             On A, define the scalar product by setting

                                                                                         (f, g) = [f ḡ△]0 ,                                        (0.0)

                                             where eλ = e−λ and [f ]0 is the constant term of the power series f .
                                                It turns out that
                                                the characters χλ of finite dimensional irreducible representations of g are uniquely deter-
                                             mined by their properties
                                                (i) to form an orthogonal (with respect to the form (0.0)) basis in AW , the algebra of
                                             W -invariant elements of A;
                                                (ii) χλ = eλ + terms with exponents µ such that µ < λ.
                                                Here for Lie superalgebras I consider the following problem: what are the analogs of the
                                             scaral product (0.0) (hence, of △ and W ) for which (i) and (ii) hold? If (i) and (ii) do not
                                             hold as stated, how to modify the definitions and the statement to make them reasonably
                                             interesting?

0.2. Main result. So far, there is not much that can count as a result, actually. I consider
this note as a remark on the results from [M] and a report on the work in progress.
   It turns out that for Lie superalgebras there is no function ∆ (understood as a formal
distribution) such that the characters of irreducible representations would satisfy (0.1), i.e.,
were orthonormal. With one exception: the series osp(1|2n). Thanks to this excepton, the
main results of this note are:
   1) For osp(1|2n) I reproduce an observation of Rittenberg and Scheunert [RS] on a cor-
respondence between irreducible osp(1|2n)-modules and o(2n + 1)-modules. (I also give a
short and lucid demonstration of this correspondence. 1 ) From this correspondence I deduce
in the o(2n + 1) case the existence of another set of orthogonal polynomials in addition to
the set described in [M].
   2) For any simple Lie superalgebra g I can produce a function ∆ for which the characters
of the typical representations are orthonormal with respect to (0.0). I hope to return to this
topic elsewhere.
Remark . Observe that for the simple Lie algebras, ∆ appears in the Weyl integration for-
mula: if f is a class function on a compact Lie group G such that Lie(G) ⊗C ∼
                                                                            = g and T ⊂ G
is a maximal torus, then              Z          Z
                                              f dg =       f ∆dt.                                 (0.2)
                                          G            T
For the general Lie superalgebras the analog of identity (0.2) is unknown to me. Here are
several little problems: not every simple Lie superalgebra (supergroup) over C has a compact
form; the volume of those that have may vanish identically, cf. [B].

          §1. The orthogonality of the characters of osp(1|2n)-modules
   We recall some basic facts from the representation theory of osp(1|2n) (see, e.g., [K]) and
(for convenience) o(2n + 1).

1.1. osp(1|2n), its roots and characters. Set

        R0̄ = {±εi ± εj for i 6= j; ±2εi }, R1̄ = {±εi };
        S0̄ = {±εi ± εj for i 6= j} ⊂ R0̄ ;
               P                            P     P          P        P
        2ρ0 = i<j (εi − εj + εi + εj ) + i 2εi = 2 i<j εi + 2 i εi = 2 (n − i + 1)εi .
    For the Lie superalgebras
                                                               1X
                                 ρ = ρ0 − ρ1 , where ρ1 =          εi .
                                                               2 i

All osp(1|2n)-modules are typical. The invariant bilinear form is str(ad(x)2 ). Explicitely,
the restriction of this form onto Cartan subalgebra reads as follows:
                    str(ad(x)2 ) = (±εi ± εj )2 + (±2εi )2 − (±εi )2 =
                                    P                P           P

                    2 (εi ± εj )2 + 4 (±εi )2 − (±εi )2 =
                      P                 P            P

                          (εi + εj )2 + (εi − εj )2 + 6 (εi )2 =
                      P                               P
                    2
                    (4n + 2) (εi )2 .
                              P

    Leites informed me, that this demonstration basically coincides with the one Deligne communicated to
Leites in 1991 (unpublished).

and sign′ (w) is equal to −1 to the power equal to the number of reflections in the even roots
α except those α for which α2 ∈ R1̄ .
  The Weyl group W of osp(1|2n) is equal to Sn ◦ (Z/2)n and
        sign′ (σ · τ1 . . . τn ) = sign(σ) for any σ ∈ Sn and τi from the i-th copy of Z/2.
  Observe that                                  X

                                               w∈W
Indeed, apply the character formula to the trivial module.
  In other words, everything is the same as for o(2n + 1) but instead of the character sign
on W we now take sign′ .
  The unique, up to W -action system of simple roots in g is of the form
                                   Π = {ε1 − ε2 , . . . , εn−1 − εn , εn }.
Observe that

We will use the latter expression of L as well.

1.2. o(2n + 1), its roots and characters. Clearly, R(o(2n + 1)) = S(osp(1|2n))0̄ ∪
R(osp(1|2n))1̄ and ρ is P
                        the half-sum of the positive roots; the restriction of the Killing
form is proportional to   ε2i , the Weyl group is W = Sn ◦ (Z/2)n and for the nontrivial
homomorphism sign : Z/2 −→ {±1} we have

                      sign(σ · τ1 . . . τn ) = sign(σ)sign(τ1 ) . . . sign(τn )
                       for any σ ∈ Sn and τi from the i-th copy of Z/2.
The system of simple roots is the same as for osp(1|2n); the character of the finite dimensional
irreducible o(2n + 1)-module V λ with highest weight λ is
                                               sign(w)ew(λ+ρ)

   Let P be the group of weights of osp(1|2) and let A = C[P ] be the group  P of formal
                        λ
exponents of the form e , where λ ∈ P . Recall that λ ∈ P if and only if λ =  ni εi , where
ni ∈ Z for all the i.
   The Weyl group W = Sn ◦ (Z/2)n of osp(1|2n) acts on P , hence, on A, as follows: Sn
permutes the εi and (Z/2)n changes their signs.
   Observe that for o(2n + 1) the group of weights is larger than same for osp(1|2n): the
former includes the half-integer ni .
4.2. Theorem . For o(2n + 1) there exists a unique (up to a constant factor) basis of AW
consisting of λ ∈PP + such that
                                                   eν and the coefficients uλ,µ are rational
                                           P
  a) Fλ = mλ +      uλ,µ mµ , where mλ =
                     µ<λ                                     ν∈{the orbit of λ}
functions in t and ǫ;
  b) for f, g ∈ A define the pairing (f, g) by means of formula (0.0), where ∆ is determined
by (1.3). Then
                                    (Fλ , Fµ ) = 0 if λ 6= µ.
                                       P
Proof. Uniquness. Since Fλ = mλ +          uλ,µ mµ , it follows that the transition matrix from
                                       µ<λ
                                                                aλ,µ Fµ . If Fλ ′ is another set of
                                                             P
Fλ to Fλ is an uppertriangular one, i.e., mλ = Fλ +
                                                                                  µ<λ
elements from A with the properties needed,   then the transition matrix from mλ to Fλ ′
is also an uppertriangular one, so Fλ ′ =
                                          P
                                            bλ,µ Fµ . If both the bases are orthogonal, i.e.,
                                                               µ≤λ
(Fλ , Fµ ) = (Fλ ′ , F µ′ ) = 0 for λ 6= µ, this means that Fλ = Fλ ′ · Cλ .
  Existence. It suffices to prove the existence of an operator D : AW −→ AW such that
  i) (Df, g) =P   (f, Dg);
  ii) Dmλ =           cλ,µ mµ ;
                   µ≤λ
    iii) if λ, µ ∈ P + are distinct, then cλ,λ 6= cµ,µ .

In the Cartan subalgebra h ⊂ g select h1 = ε∗1 which plays the role of a miniscule weight for
the dual root system. More exactly, for R+ = {εi − εj ; εi + εj ; εi } we have α(h1 ) = 0 or 1
for any α ∈ R+ .
   Define the action of the operator T = Th1 by setting

                                                T eλ = q λ(h1 ) eλ

The operator D is self-adjoint. Indeed,

             ( since the constant term is always W -invariant) = [T (△+ f ) · ḡ△+ ]0 .

Similarly,
                                     (Dg, f ) = [T (△+ g) · f¯△+ ]0 .

But, as is easy to verify,

Therefore,

is an automorphism.
   Let us compute Φ. Since α(h1 ) = 0 or 1 for any α ∈ R+ , it follows that

and p(X) = #(odd roots that occure in X). Let us calculate Deµ for µ ∈ P . Observe that

The last result does not depend on the choice of the one-dimensional character (sign or sign′ )
on W because the orbit of the weight λ contains a dominant weight if and only if the λ2i are
pairwise distinct. Therefore,

where εα = ±1; hence, w(ρ − σ(X)) is of the same form (1.6) and, therefore,
                           w(ρ − σ(X)) = ρ − σ(Y ) for some Y ⊂ R+ .
Thus,

Consequently, Dmλ =              Cλν (h1 ) · mν and a) is verified.

  Let us prove b). In (1.4), ν = λ if and only if Y = ∅ and
                wµ = λ ⇐⇒ w(ρ − σ(X)) = ρ, µ = w −1λ, X = R+ ∩ (−wR+ ).
