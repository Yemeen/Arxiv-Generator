                                               The study of Maps (X, G), the group of polynomial maps of a complex
                                            algebraic variety X into a complex algebraic group G, and its representations
                                            is only well developed in the case that X is a complex torus C∗ . In this
                                            case Maps (X, G) is a loop group and the corresponding Lie-algebra Maps
                                                ◦                                   ◦
                                            (X, G) is the loop algebra C[t, t−1 ]⊗ G. Here the representation comes to life
                                                                                ◦
                                            only after one replaces Maps (X, G) by its universal central extension, the
                                            corresponding affine Lie-algebra. One then obtains the well known theory of
                                            highest weight modules, vertex representations, modular forms and character
                                            theory and so on.
                                               The next easiest case is presumably the case of n dimensional torus (C∗ )n .
                                                                                                 ◦
                                            So we consider the universal central extension of G ⊗C[t±            ±
                                                                                                    1 , · · · , tn ] which is
                                            referred to as the toroidal Lie-algebra τ in [EM] and [MEY ]. The most
                                            interesting modules are the integrable modules (where the real root space
                                            acts locally nilpotently (see section 2)), as they lift to the corresponding
                                            group. Unlike the affine case where the central extension is one dimensional,
                                            the toroidal case has infinite dimensional centre which makes the theory
                                            more complicated. For the first time a large number of integrable (reducible)
                                            modules for toroidal Lie-algebras (simply laced case) have been constructed
                                            through the use of vertex operators in [EM] and [MEY].
                                               In this paper we construct two classes of (Examples (4.1) and (4.2)) of ir-
                                            reducible integrable modules for toroidal Lie-algebras with finite dimensional

                                                                                    1
weight spaces. In sections 4 and 5 we prove that any irreducible integrable
module where part of the centre acts non-trivially are the ones given in Ex-
ample (4.2) upto an automorphism of τ . We have proved in [E3] that the
only modules with the above property where center acts trivially are the one
given in Example 4.1 (see Remark 5.5). In this case a similar classification
is obtained in [YY] with a stronger assumption on the weight spaces. These
results in the case n = 1 are due to [C] and [CP].
   In section 1, after recalling the construction of non-twisted affine Lie-
algebras from [K], we establish the necessary terminology for root systems,
non-degenerate billinear form and the Weyl group for toroidal Lie-algebras.
In section 2 we recall the actual definition of toroidal Lie-algebras and in-
tegrable modules and prove some standard facts about the Weyl group and
weight systems (Lemma 2.3). Then we prove that an irreducible integrable
module for τ with finite dimensional weight spaces has a highest weight vec-
                                      ◦
tor in the following sense. Let Gaf =G ⊗C[t1 , t−1
                                                1 ] ⊕ CC1 ⊕ Cd1 be an affine
Lie-algebra and let Gaf = N − ⊕ h1 ⊕ N + be the standard decomposition.
Then we prove that if some zero degree central operator acts non-trivially
there exists a vector killed by N + ⊗ An−1 (Proposition (2.4) and (4.8) after
                                                     ◦
twisting the module upto an automorphism). Let G= n− ⊕ h◦ ⊕ n+ and sup-
pose all zero degree central operators act trivially then we prove that there
is a vector killed by n+ ⊗ An (Proposition 2.12). These two results may be
seen as generalization of Theorem (2.4) of [C].
   In the section 3 we define graded and non-graded highest weight modules
in the generality of loop Kac-Moody Lie-algebras and prove (Proposition 3.5)
that there is a one-one correspondence between the graded and non-graded
cases. The problem now reduces to the classification of irreducible integrable
highest weight modules (non-graded) (Lemma 3.6). We prove (Remark 3.9)
that any such module is actually a module for Gaf ⊗ An−1 /I for a co-finite
ideal I. (we are in the case where some zero degree center acts non-trivially).


                                      2
In a combinatorial Lemma (3.11) which is of independent interest we prove
that such a Lie-algebra is isomorphic to ⊕Gaf (direct sum of finitely many
copies of Gaf ). Then it is very standard to classify irreducible integrable
highest weight modules for ⊕Gaf .
   If the zero degree center acts trivially then the full center should act triv-
ially (Proposition 4.13) where we use an interesting result (Proposition 4.12)
on Hisenberg Lie-algebras due to Futorny [F]. In this case the classification
is given in [E3] (see Remark 5.5).
   We prove in Lemma (4.6) in the generality of irreducible modules for τ
with finite dimensional weight spaces that most of the center acts trivially. In
fact in each graded component of the center at most one dimensional space
acts non-trivially.
   In other papers [BB] and [E4] a more general toroidal Lie-algebra is con-
sidered by adding an infinite set of derivations. They have constructed in-
tegrable irreducible (highest weight) modules for toroidal Lie-algebra where
almost all of the “center” acts non-trivially. It remains to be seen which
toroidal Lie-algebra admits an interesting representation theory in general.
More general Lie-algebras called extended affine Lie-algebras (EALA), of
which toroidal Lie-algebras are prime examples, are studied extensively. See
for example [BGK] and the references therein.


1 Section
We first recall the some notation of the theory of affine Lie-algebras from
chapter 6 of [K]. We always denote N the non-negative integers, Z the integers
and Z+ the positive integers. All our vector spaces are over the complex
numbers C.

   Let G be a simple finite dimensional Lie-algebra. Let h be a Cartan
subalgebra of finite dimension d. Let A = (aij ) be the Cartan matrix of

the corresponding non-twisted affine Lie-algebra. Let a0 , a1 , · · · ad be the
numerical labels of the Dynkin diagram S(A). Let a∨0 , · · · , a∨d be the nu-
merical labels of the Dynkin diagram S(AT ). Let b−1
                                                  i  = a∨i . We know
from [K] that for a non-twisted affine Lie-algebra that a0 = b0 = 1. Write
A = Diag(a0 b0 , a1 b1 , · · · , ad bd )B where B is a symmetric matrix. Let h be
                                                                       ◦
the Cartan subalgebra spanned by α0∨ , α1∨, · · · , αd∨ , d0 such that h is spanned
by α1∨ , · · · , αd∨ . Define αi ∈ h∗ by αi (αj∨ ) = aji , αi (d0 ) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ d
and α0 (d0 ) = 1. Define w in h∗ such that w(αi∨) = δi0 and w(d0) = 0.
Then h∗ is spanned by α0 , α1 , · · · αd , w for dimension reasons. Define nonde-
generate symmetric billinear form on h by (αi∨, αj∨ ) = aj bj aij , (αi∨ , d0) = δi0
and (d0 , d0 ) = 0. Similarly h∗ carries a billinear form such that (αi , αj ) =
b−1 −1
 i ai aij , (αi , w) = δi0 and (w, w) = 0. As in [K] we normalize the form on
                                                      ◦
h∗ by (β, β) = 2 where β is the maximal root of G. Define

                            δ    =     i=1 ai αi + α0


Then δ − α0 = β. Let β ∨ = C − α0∨ . ¿From [K] we have the following.
   (δ, αi ) = 0, (δ, δ) = 0, (δ, w) = 1, (C, αi∨) = 0, (C, C) = 0, (C, d0) =
1, δ(αi∨) = 0, αi (C) = 0 and w(C) = 1.

                    (2) (λ, β)       = λ(β ∨ )

Proof: It is easy to see.
   Define the ith fundamental reflection ri on h∗ such that ri λ = λ −
λ(αi∨ )αi , 0 ≤ i ≤ d. Let Waf be the Weyl group generated by ri . Then
(,) on h∗ is Waf −invariant.

(1.2) Lemma Let λ ∈h be miniscule then λ(β ∨ ) = 0 or 1.

Proof Follows from exercise 13 of Chapter III of [H]. Just note that λ is
dominant integral.
    We will now generalize this for toroidal algebras ([EM], [MEY]). Fix a
positive integer n. Let h be the 2n + d dimensional vector space spanned by
α1∨ , α2∨, · · · αd+n
                  ∨
                      , d1 , · · · , dn . Let Ã = (Aij ) be a matrix of order n+d such that
removal of n − 1 rows and the corresponding columns in the last n rows and
n columns should give A. We will describe the matrix explicitly. Recall that
A = (ai,j )0≤i,j≤d is the affine matrix. Then Ad+i,j = a0,j , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ d;
Aj,d+i = aj,0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ d; Ad+i,d+j = 2, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Let D̃ = diag
(a1 b1 , a2 b2 , · · · ad bd , 1, · · · 1) be a matrix of order d + n. Then Ã = D̃ B̃ where
B̃ is symmetric matrix.
    Define αi ∈ h∗ such that αi (αj∨) = aji for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d + n, αi (dj ) = 0
for 1 ≤ i ≤ d, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, αd+i (dj ) = δij for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Define wi ∈
h∗ (1 ≤ i ≤ n) by wi (αj∨ ) = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ d and wi (αj+d
                                                       ∨

j ≤ n, wj (di ) = 0. Then we will see that α1 , · · · αd+n , w1 , · · · wn is a basis
of h∗ . Let ad+i = bd+j = 1 for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Define a symmetric billinear
form h∗ by (αi , αj ) = b−1 −1

λ0 is a weight of V (λ) that occur in Vg . Since each weight space is finite

 (1) There exists a wieght vector ui of weight λi such that N + ui = 0.

 (2) λi (dj ) = λk (dj ) ∀i, k ∈ Z+ and 2 ≤ j ≤ n

Follows from Lemma 2.3(3). Recall that △ is finite root system. Let △+a

0}. Since λ(C1 ) = K1 > 0 it is easy to see that △(γ) is finite. This situation
is very similar to the proof of Theorem 2.4 (i) of [C]. (Here we need our

Lemma 2.6 as the arguments of Lemma 2.6 of [C] are not correct. The 6th
line from above on page 322 does not follows from earlier argument). Now
from the claims 1,2 and 3 in the proof of 2.4 (i) of [C] we have a vector v in
Vλ+p1 δ1 , p1 ≥ 0 such that
                                   τrδ1 v = 0, r > 0

                                     τα+sδ1 v = 0

                                               re . Since V is integrable it
follows that U(N + )v is finite dimensional. Choose λ1 maximal in the ordering
≤ among the weights in U(N + )v. Then there exists a vector u1 of weight λ1
such that
                                     N + u1 = 0.

Further λ1 = λ + p1 δ1 + η1 , η1 ≥ 0 and λ1 (dj ) = λ(dj ) for 2 ≤ j ≤ n and

                        λ1 (d1 ) − λ(d1 ) = p1 + η1 (d1 ) ≥ 0.

Now by Lemma 2.6 there exists λ̃1 ∈ P (V ) such that

(2.9) Vλ̃1 +η = 0 ∀η ∈ Γ+
                        0 \{0} and λ̃1 (di ) = λ1 (di ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By the
assumption in the Lemma there exists η̃1 > 0 such that

                                  λ̃1 + η̃1 ∈ P (V ).

By (2.9) it follows that η̃1 (d1 ) > 0. As η̃1 ≥ 0 and we also have η̃1 (di ) = 0
for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Repeating the above argument for λ̃1 + η̃1 in place of λ to
get a weight vector u2 of weight λ2 = λ̃1 + η̃1 + p2 δ1 + η2 , η2 ≥ 0 such that
N + u2 = 0. Now λ2 (dj ) = λ̃1 (dj ) = λ(dj ) for 2 ≤ j ≤ n.

                     λ2 (d1 ) = λ1 (d1 ) + p2 + η2 (d1 ) + η̃1 (d1 )

so that λ2 (d1 )−λ1 (d1 ) = p2 +η2 (d1 )+ η̃1 (d1 ) > 0. (Note the strict inequality).
Repeating this process we have (1), (2) and (3). Clearly λi (αj∨ ) ∈ N 1 ≤

Then λi s determine unique coset of weight lattice. As earlier let λ0 ∈h
be the unique miniscule weight. Thus λ0 <0 λi ∀i ∈ Z. (Note that each λi is
dominant integral weight).
                Xd
   Let λ0 = λ0 + λ(di )δi +K1 w1 ≤ λi . This inequality is by construction of
                    i=1
                                  d

λi . Recall λi = λi +λi (d1 )δ1 +   λ(di )δi +K1 w1 and we have λi (di )−λ(d1) >
                                   i=2
0. Now λ0 (αi∨) = λ0 (αi∨ ) ∈ N for i = 1, 2, · · · , d.

                                 ∨
                            λ0 (αd+1 ) = λ0 (C1 − β ∨ )
                                           = K1 − λ0 (β ∨)

Since K1 is integer and positive we have K1 ≥ 1. By Lemma (1.2) we have
λ0 (β ∨ ) = 0 on 1. Thus λ0 (αd+1
                              ∨
                                  ) ∈ N. Hence λ0 is dominant integral and
λ0 ≤ λi . By Proposition 12.5 (a) of [K] it follows that λ0 is a weight of V (λi )
for all i. This proves (4). [QED].

Proof of the Proposition (2.4) Assume K1 > 0. Suppose the conclu-
sions of Lemma (2.8) are true. Since λi ’s are distinct, V (λi ) are all non-
isomorphic irreducible heighest weight modules. Hence their sum has to be
direct. But Vλ0 ∩ V (λi ) 6= 0. Hence dim Vλ0 is infinite. A contradiction.
    So we conclude that there exists a λ ∈ P (V ) such that

(2.10) λ + η ∈                                         / P (V ) for α ∈ △+a
             / P (V ), ∀0 6=η ≥ 0. In particular λ + α ∈                 re .
Thus from Lemma (2.3) (4) it follows that λ(α∨ ) ∈ N:

means Xα ⊗ tm Vλ = 0. But the positive real roots generates the positive
null roots and hence N + ⊗ An−1 Vλ = 0. So we are done. Now assume that

false. Then Vµ+γ+δ1 6= 0 for some γ and δ 1 .

Case 1 (α + γ, α) > 0. We know by Lemma (1.4) (2) that (α + γ)(α∨ ) > 0.
Put γ1 = α + δ + δ 1 and consider

                   (µ + γ + δ 1 )(γ1∨ ) = (λ + α + γ)(α∨ ) > 0.

We are using the fact that λ(Ci ) = 0 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. By Lemma (2.3) (4),
λ + α + γ + δ + δ 1 − (α + δ + δ 1 ) = λ + γ ∈ P (V ) a contradiction to (2.10).

Case 2 (α + γ, γ) > 0 which can be done in the same way.
   Since the symmetric billinear form given by an affine matrix is semi pos-
itive definite on the root lattice, we are left with the

Case 3 (α + γ, α + γ) = 0. This implies α + γ = ℓδ1 for ℓ > 0 and further
(α + γ, α) = 0 and (α + γ, γ) = 0. Then (λ + α + γ + δ + δ 1 )(γ1∨ ) = λ(α∨ )
where γ1 = α + δ + δ 1 .

Sub case 1 λ(α∨ ) > 0 (in any case λ(α∨ ) ≥ 0). By lemma 2.3 (4) we have

             λ + α + γ + δ + δ 1 − (α + δ + δ 1 ) = λ + γ ∈ P (V )

a contradiction to (2.10).

                                       14
Sub case 2 λ(α∨) = 0. Note that λ((−α + ℓδ1 + δ + δ 1 )∨ )
                                     2
                              =ℓ          λ(C1 ) > 0
                                   | α |2

Hence by Lemma 2.3 (4) we have

             λ + α + γ + δ + δ 1 − (γ + δ + δ 1 ) = λ + α ∈ P (V )

a contradiction to (2.10). Thus our claim follows. As earlier it follows that
N + ⊗ An−1 Vµ = 0. Hence we are done. The case K1 < 0 can be done
similarly.[QED].

(2.12) Proposition Let V be integrable irreducible module for τ with
finite dimensional weight spaces. Suppose Ki = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then there
exists a weight vector v in V such that

                               n+ ⊗ An v = 0 or

                                 n− ⊗ An v = 0
       ◦           ◦
where G= n+ ⊕ h ⊕n− is the standard decomposition.

Proof This follows from the proof of theorem 2.4 (ii) of [C]. Use Lemma
(2.6) of our paper instead of Lemma 2.6 of [C]. The fact that the dimension
of null roots could be greater than one does not matter.

Then U(H) is clearly Zn −graded abelian-Lie-algebra. Let ψ : U(H) → A a

   Just note that h does not play any role.
   We need the notion of highest weight module for G̃A . Let ψ be as above.

(3.2) Definition A module V of G̃A is called highest weight module for
G̃A if there exist a weight vector (with respect to h ⊕ D) v in V such that
   (1) V = U(G̃A )v (2) NA+ v = 0 (3) U(h̃A )v is an irreducible module for
h̃A given by ψ.
   We will now define universal highest weight module for G̃A . Let ψ be
as above such that Aψ is irreducible. Let NA+ act trivially on Aψ . Now


                                          16
consider the following induced G̃A − module. M(ψ) = U(G̃A ) ⊗B Aψ where
B = NA+ ⊕ h̃A .
   We have the following standard.

(3.3) Proposition

 (1) As h ⊕ D module, M(ψ) is a weight module.

 (2) M(ψ) is a free NA− module and as a vector space

                              M(ψ) ∼
                                   = U(NA− ) ⊗ Aψ .

 (3) M(ψ) has a unique irreducible quotient called V (ψ).

Proof See [E3].
                                                                        ′′
   We need the following non-graded highest weight module for GA1 ⊕ h .

                                           ′′
(3.4) Definition A module W of GA1 ⊕h is said to be (non-graded) highest
weight module if there exists a weight vector (with respect to h) v in W such
                  ′′
that (1) U(GA1 ⊕ h ) v = W
(2) NA+ v = 0
(3) There exists a ψ in H ∗ such that hv = ψ(h)v for all h ∈ H.
   Let ψ ∈ H ∗ and let H act as one dimensional vector space C(ψ) by
ψ. Let NA+ acts trivially on C(ψ). Consider the induced module M(ψ) =
         ′′
U(GA1 ⊕ h )⊗B′ C(ψ) where B ′ = NA+ ⊕ H.
   Now by standard arguments M(ψ) has a unique irreducible quotient
V (ψ).
   Let ψ be as above and let ψ = E(1) ◦ ψ where E(1) : Aψ → C defined by
E(1)tm = 1. We will make V (ψ)A a (graded) G̃A −module by
g(m)v(r) = (g(m)v)(m + r) for g ∈ GA1 , r, m ∈ Zn , v ∈ V (ψ).

(3.5) Proposition Let ψ and ψ as above. Assume that Aψ is irreducible
h̃A− module. Let G ⊂ Zn be such that {tm , m ∈ G} is a coset representatives
for A/Aψ . Let v be a highest weight vector of V (ψ). Then
(1)     V (ψ)A = ⊕m∈G Uv(m) as G̃A −module. Uv(m) is a G̃A −module gener-
ated by v(m).
      (2) Each Uv(m) is an irreducible G̃A −module.
      (3) Uv(0) ∼
                = V (ψ) as G̃A −module.

Proof Follows from Theorem (1.8) of [E1]. It is stated for special ψ. But
we have only used the fact Aψ is irreducible h̃A− module. More over our G̃A
is smaller than one in [E] but all the arguments take place inside G̃A . [QED].

(3.6) Lemma (Lemma (1.10) , [E3]) Let ψ and ψ as above. Then V (ψ)
has finite dimensional weight spaces (with respect to h ⊕ D) if and only if
V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces (with respect to h).
      The following Lemma tells for which ψ, V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight
space with respect to h. There by giving conditions for V (ψ) to have finite
dimensional weight spaces.

(3.7) Lemma V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces if and only if ψ
factors through h′ ⊗ A/I for some co-finite ideal I of A.

Proof Assume that V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces. Let △+ be
a positive root system for G. Let α be a simple root in △+ . Let Yα be a root
vector for the root −α. For fixed j, consider, for a highest weight vector v,

                                 {Yα ⊗ tnj v, n ∈ Z}



                                         18
which is contained in the same weight space Vλ−α (ψ), λ = ψ | h. Thus there
exists a polynomial Pj (α) = ai tij such that
                            P


                                  Yα ⊗ Pj (α)v = 0.

                            ai Yα ⊗ tij . Let (P ) be the ideal generated by polyno-
                        P
Where Yα ⊗ Pj (α) =
mial P inside A.

Claim 1 Yα ⊗ (Pj (α))v = 0.
Consider 0 = h(m)Yα ⊗ Pj (α)v = Yα ⊗ Pj (α)h(m)v − α(h)Yα ⊗ tm Pj (α)v.
Since h(m) acts by scalar on v, the first term is zero. Hence the claim.
            Q
   Put Pj = Pj (α) where α runs through all simple positive roots.

Claim 2 Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v = 0 for β ∈ △+ . First note that (Pj ) ⊂ Pj (α) and
hence the claim is true for any simple root. Claim by induction on the height
β. Caim is true for β such that height β = 1. Let α be a simple root in △+ .
Let Xα be the root vector of root α. Consider

          Xα (m)Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v = Yβ ⊗ (Pj )Xα (m)v + [Xα , Yβ ] ⊗ tm (Pj )v.

The first term is zero as v is highest weight vector. The second term is zero
by induction. Since Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v is killed by Xα (m) for α simple and for any
m ∈ Zn it is easy to see that Xα (m).Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v = 0 for all α ∈ △+ and
m ∈ Zn . Hence Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v is a highest weight of weight λ − β. But V (ψ) is
an irreducible highest weight module and hence Yβ ⊗ (Pj )v = 0. Hence claim
2.

Claim 3 h ⊗ (Pj )v = 0 ∀h ∈ h′ .
Consider hα ⊗ (Pj )v = Xα Yα ⊗ (Pj )v − Yα ⊗ (Pj )Xα v = 0 since hα covers all
h′ for α simple we have claim 3.
     Let I be an ideal generated by P1 , P2 , · · · , Pn inside A. It is elementary to
see that A/I is finite dimensional. Thus ψ factors through h′ ⊗A/I. In fact we

                                          19
can prove that G ′ ⊗I.V (ψ) = 0 by considering W = {w ∈ V (ψ), G ′ ⊗Iw = 0}.
We have just seen that W is non empty. It is easy to see that W is a sub
module. Hence W = V (ψ).
   Conversely suppose that ψ factors through h′ ⊗ A/I for a co-finite ideal
I of A.

Claim 4 For β > 0, Yβ ⊗ Iv = 0. Let α be simple positive. Consider

                Xα (m)Yα ⊗ Iv = Yα ⊗ IXα (m)v + hα ⊗ Iv
                                  = 0
Let α1 be simple positive root different from α. Then clearly Xα (m)Yα ⊗Iv =
0. Hence Yα ⊗ Iv is a highest weight vector. Since V (ψ) is irreducible highest
weight module we conclude that Yα ⊗ Iv = 0.
   Now arguing as earlier on the induction of ht β we have Yβ ⊗ Iv = 0.
Hence the claim. Thus we have G 1 ⊗ Iv = 0. Now consider the non-zero
submodule
                        W = {w ∈ V (ψ), G 1 ⊗ Iw = 0}
of V (ψ). Since V (ψ) is irreducible we have W = V (ψ).
   Let Vµ (ψ) be a wiehgt space of V (ψ). Then by P BW theorem any vector
of Vµ (ψ) is linear combination of the vector of the form.

(3.8) Yα1 tm1 Yα2 tm2 · · · Yαk tmk such that −

h and αi > 0. Thus the number of αi that can occur are finite. Now
for any finite dimensional space W of V (ψ) and for any fixed αi the space
Yαi ⊗ tm W , for m ∈ Zn is finite dimensional. Thus at every stage in the
equation (3.8) we get a finite dimensional space. So we conclude that Vµ (ψ)
is finite dimensional. [QED].

(3.9) Remark (1) V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight space if and only if
G ′ ⊗ I.V (ψ) = 0 for a co-finite ideal I of A.

                                  1i · · · anin )0≤mi ≤Ni −1
                                    1

                                                   1≤ij ≤Nj .

   The index m determines rows and the index (i1 , · · · , in ) determines columns.
For n = 1, X becomes Vandermonde matrix as a1i 6= a1j . Hence X is invert-
ible. We will now prove this for n = 2 and then extend it for all n.

   Given a square matrix A, we call a square matrix of the form.

                                                   j
a block diagonal matrix of A. Let B = (a1i )1≤i,j≤N1 and

                                          j
                                   C = (a2i )1≤i,j≤N2 .

For K = 1, 2, since aKi are distinct non-zero complex numbers for distinct
i, B and C are Vandermonde matrices and hence they are invertible. Let B̃
be N × N block diagonal matrix of B. Similarly C̃ for C. Clearly both B̃
and C̃ are invertible.
   Let σ :< 1, 2, · · · , N >→< 1, · · · , N > be such that

                               σ(p) = (m − 1)N2 + (ℓ + 1)

where p = N1 ℓ + m, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ N2 − 1, 1 ≤ m ≤ N1 (recall that N1 N2 = N).
                                          ≈               ≈
Clearly σ is injective. Let D̃ = ( c k,ℓ ) where c k,ℓ = c̃σ(k),ℓ , C̃ = (c̃k,ℓ ) and
B̃ = (b̃k,ℓ ). Then clearly D̃ is a product of permutation matrix and C̃ and
hence invertible. We now claim that upto permutation matrix X = B̃ D̃
which is invertible.
   Consider (k, ℓ) entry of B̃ D̃.

Claim Exactly one and only one term in (3.12) is non zero.

                   let k = p1 N1 + q1 ,        0 ≤ p1 ≤ N2 − 1
                                               1 ≤ q1 ≤ N1
                         ℓ = sN2 + t,          0 ≤ s ≤ N1 − 1
                                               1 ≤ t ≤ N2

   Since B̃ is a block diagonal matrix of B, b̃kj to be non zero in (3.11), j
should be equal to p1 N1 + q2 for some 1 ≤ q2 ≤ N1 .
   Now σ(j) = (q2 −1)N2 + (p1 + 1). Now since C̃ is a block diagonal matrix,
C̃σ(j),ℓ to be non-zero ℓ should be equal to
   (q2 − 1)N2 + t which forces q2 − 1 = s. Thus (3.12) equal to

                                  as1q1 at2(p1 +1) .

This proves the claim. Notice that the exact placement of the entries are
given by the permutation matrix. But the entries of the rows and columns
do not get mixed up. Hence X = B̃ D̃ up to permutation.
                                                      j−1
   Now we will prove the result for any n. Let Ak = (aki  )1≤i,j≤Nk and
let Ãk be a block diagonal matrix of Ak . Consider Ã1 and Ã2 . Let E be a
permutation matrix given as in the case n = 2. The only difference is that E
is actually a block diagonal matrix of a permutation matrix of order N1 N2 .
Now Ã1 E B̃2 is a block diagonal matrix of a matrix of order N1 N2 . Now take
Ã1 E Ã2 in place of Ã1 and Ã3 in place of Ã2 in the case n = 2. Repeat the
process to get a matrix of the form Ã1 E Ã2 F Ã3 (F is a permutation matrix)
which is a block diagonal matrix of a matrix of order N1 N2 N3 . Each entry
of this matrix is of the form

                                 j1 −1 j2 −1 j3 −1
                                a1i 1
                                      a2i2 a3i3 .

   Repeating this process we get the desired matrix X which is invertible.

   Let (X1 , · · · , XN ) ∈ GN .
Now Φ(X −1 (X1 , · · · , XN )T = (X1 , · · · , XN ). This completes the proof of
Lemma 3.11 (a).
   (b) G ⊗ Pj (tj ) ⊂ kerΦ, since the restriction of Φ is nothing but evaluation
map at the roots of Pj (tj ). Thus we have G ⊗ I ⊆ kerΦ. Consider the
space T = {G ⊗ tm , 0 ≤ mi < Ni }. Since any G ⊗ P can be reduced to the
linear combinations of elements of T modulo G ⊗ I, it is a spanning set. In
(a) we actually proved Φ is surjective on T . Further Φ is injective on T as
the corresponding matrix is invertible. Thus it follows that G ⊗ A/I ∼= GN .
[QED].

(3.13) Remark The condition aij 6= aik is necessary. Otherwise Φ is not
surjective.
   Let V (λi ) be irreducible heighest weight module for G. Then it is known
by Lemma (9.10) of [K] that V (λi ) is irreducible G ′ −module. Thus V =
                                   ′
⊗N
 i=1 V (λi ) is an irreducible GN −module. Restrict the map Φ in (3.10) to
       ′′                                                              ′′

                                  . Thus V is irreducible GA′ ⊕ h module
via Φ. Consider I = (i1 , · · · , in ) for 1 ≤ ij ≤ Nj . They are N of them. Give
them an order say I1 , · · · IN . The map Φ is defined in this order. Now define

by ψ(h ⊗ t ) =    I λi (h), h ∈ h and ψ(h) =   λi (h), h ∈ h. Then it is
                   i=1
easy to see that V is a highest weight module with highest weight ψ. Thus
we have V (ψ) ∼= V . Now define

(3.15) ψ : U(H) → A as Zn −graded homomorphism by
ψ(h ⊗ tm ) = ψ(h ⊗ tm )tm . So in order to get modules for G̃A we need to know
that Aψ is an irreducible h̃A −module. (See proposition (3.5) and Lemma

                                       24
(3.1)). It is well known that V (λi ) is integrable if and only if λi is dominant
integral. Since our interest is in constructing integrable modules we will
assume that each λi is dominant.

(3.16) Lemma Let ψ be as above. Assume each λi is dominant and not
all of them are zero. Then Aψ is irreducible h̃A −module.

Proof Let Ij = (i1 , · · · , in ) and let λj = λi1 i2 ···in . Consider Γ = {m ∈
Zn , tm ∈ Aψ } ψ being an algebra homomorphism, Γ is closed under addition.
              P
ψ(h ⊗ 1) =       λi1 ···in and each weight is dominant and not all zero. So
ψ(h ⊗ 1) 6= 0 for some h. Hence 0 ∈ Γ. To prove the Lemma it is sufficient
to prove that Γ is a sub group (see Lemma (3.1)). For 1 ≤ j ≤ N consider
ψ j = ψ | h ⊗ C[tj , t−1
                      j ].


                             k      −k                                                m
Claim Image ψ j = C[tj j , tj j ] for some kj ≤ Nj . Consider ψ j (h ⊗ tj j ) =
Nj
                       m m
X   X                                                            X
        λi1 ,···in (h)ajijj tj j . Clearly for a fixed ij one of   λi1 ,··· ,in (h) is
ij =1(i1 ,··· ,in )                                                  (i1 ,··· ,in )
                                             m
non zero for some h. Now ψ j (h ⊗           tj j )   = 0 for 0 < mj ≤ Nj cannot hold as
  m
(ajijj )   is a Vandermonde matrix. The same holds for −Nj ≤ mj < 0. Thus
                             k     −k
the image has to be C[tj j , tj j ] for some 0 < kj ≤ Nj . In fact kj | Nj see
Lemma (5.3) of [E2]. Thus we have

for any ℓ1 , · · · , ℓn ∈ Z. 0 < ki ≤ Ni . Let Γ0 = {(m1 , · · · , mn ) ∈ Γ, 0 ≤ mi <
ki } a finite set. To prove the lemma it is sufficient to prove that each element
of Γ0 has a inverse in Γ. This is in view of (3.17). Let m = (m1 , · · · , mn ) ∈ Γ0
be such that m1 is non-zero and minimal. (if the all first co-ordinates if Γ0
are zero we take the next one). We will first prove that there exist m1 ∈ Γ


                                               25
such that m11 = −m1 . Let k1 = ℓ1 m1 + s1 , 0 ≤ s1 < m1 , ℓ1 > 0. Consider
x = (ℓ1 + 1)m − (k1 , · · · , kr ) ∈ Γ. Then (ℓ1 + 1)m1 − k1 = −s1 + m1 ≤ m1 .
Further 0 < −s1 +m1 . Now we can assume that x ∈ Γ0 without changing the
first co-ordinate in view of (3.17). Now by minimality of m1 it will follow that
−s1 +m1 = m1 . Now consider m+(ℓ−1)m−(k1 , · · · , kr ) = (0, ∗, ∗, · · · , ) ∈ Γ.
Take any m1 ∈ Γ0 . Assume that m11 6= 0 write m11 = ℓ11 m1 + s1 , 0 ≤ s1 < m1 .
Arguing as earlier we see that s1 = 0. Hence y 1 = m1 − ℓ11 m = (0, ∗, · · · , ∗) ∈
Γ. We can further assume that y 1 ∈ Γ0 . Thus we have proved that given
m ∈ Γ0 there exists m1 ∈ Γ such that m+m1 = (0, ∗, · · · , ∗) ∈ Γ0 . Repeating
this process we get inverses of all elements of Γ0 . [QED].                      ✷

be a Laurent polynomial in n commuting variables. Let ψ and ψ as defined
in (3.14) and (3.15) with each λi dominant integrable. Then V (ψ) is an inte-
gral irreducible module for G̃A with finite dimensional weight spaces. Further
V (ψ) is isomorphic to the first component of V (ψ) ⊗ A.

Proof. From Lemma (3.16) Aψ is irreducible. Hence V (ψ) is a irreducible
highest weight module from Proposition (3.3). From Proposition (3.5) it
will follow that V (ψ) is isomorphic to the first component of V (ψ) ⊗ A.
Since each λi is dominant integral V (λi ) is integrable. Since each V (λi ) is a
highest weight module it is known that V = ⊗N
                                            i=1 V (λi ) is module with finite
dimensional weight space with respect to h where h is included diagonally in
⊕h. From Lemma (3.11) it follows that the map defined in (3.10) is surjective.
Hence V ∼
        = V (ψ). Since V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces it will
follow from Lemma (3.6) that V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces with
respect to h̃ = h ⊕ D. [QED].

Proof Let ψ = E(1)◦ψ where E(1)tm = 1. Let v be a highest weight vector
of V (ψ). Then by Lemma (3.6), V (ψ) has finite dimensional weight spaces.
Then from the proof of Lemma (3.7),V (ψ) is a module for G ′ ⊗ A/I where
I is a co-finite ideal of A. Further I is generated by polynomials Pj (tj ) for
1 ≤ j ≤ n. We can assume that Pj (tj ) has no zero roots as one can multiply
Pj (tj ) by t−ℓ
             j , ℓ > 0 and will get the same ideal I. Further we can assume
that each polynomial Pj is not a constant. In case Pj is constant then the
module will be trivial. Let aj1 , · · · , ajNj be distinct non-zero roots of Pj (tj ).

Claim G ′ ⊗ I 1 is zero on V (ψ). Consider the map Φ : G ′ ⊗ A/I → G ′ ⊗
A/I ′ → 0. It is easy to verify that ker Φ is solvable. Let α be a simple
root of G. Let Xα , Yα , Hα be a sl2 −tripple and let Gα be the span of Xα , Yα
and Hα . Consider G α = Gα ⊗ A/I which is finite dimensional. Let W be G α
module generated by v. Since V (ψ) is integrable and Xα ⊗ P acts trivially
on v and Hα ⊗ P acts as scalars, we conclude that W is finite dimensional.

                                                27
By restricting the action of the solvable Lie-algebra Gα ⊗ I ′ /I to W we get
a vector w in W (by Lie-theorem) such that Gα ⊗ I ′ /I acts as scalars on w.
From the proof of the Proposition (2.1) of [E3] (we assumed the module is
irreducible but for this conclusion we do not need it) we get that

(3.21) Gα ⊗ (I ′ /I) w = 0.

Subclaim Gα ⊗(I ′ /I) v = 0. By definition of W we have a Y ∈ U(Yα ⊗A/I)
such that Y v = w. Since V (ψ) is irreducible there exists X ∈ U(τ ) such that

                                 Xw = v = XY v

where X = X− HX+ , X+ ∈ U(N + ⊗ A)X− ∈ U(N − ⊗ A), H ∈ U(h ⊗ A).
                                                       P
First note that the weight of V (ψ) are of the form λ − ni αi + δm where
λ = ψ | h and α1 , · · · , αn the simple positive roots and n1 , · · · , na are non-
negative integers. δm is a null root. The weight of w is λ − sα for s ≥ 0.
Thus for these reasons X+ ∈ U(Xα ⊗ A). Further X− has to be constant.
Thus X is linear combinations of products of the form.

(3.22)
                       U(h ⊗ A)Xα Q1 · · · Xα Qℓ , Qi ∈ A.

   First we will see that

(3.23)
                       Gα ⊗ I ′ U(h ⊗ A)w = 0 by (3.21).
Now consider

(3.24)

                   Gα ⊗ I ′ Xα Q1 w = Xα QGα ⊗ I ′ w
                                     + [Xα , Gα ] ⊗ QI ′ w = 0

                                        28
Both terms are zero by (3.21). Now by induction on ℓ we see that

                              Gα ⊗ I ′ Xα Q1 · · · Xα Qℓ w = 0.

¿From (3.22), (3.23) and (3.24) it follows that Gα ⊗ I ′ Xw = Gα ⊗ I ′ v = 0.
This proves the subclaim. Since h′ is spanned by Hα , α simple we have


                                        h′ ⊗ I ′ v = 0.

     We will now show that Yβ ⊗ I ′ v = 0 for any positive root β where Yβ is
a root vector of root −β. We do this by induction on the height of β. We
clearly know this for β such that height β = 1 by (3.21).
     Let α1 be any simple root. Consider

                      Xα Yβ ⊗ I ′ v = Yβ ⊗ I ′ Xα v + [Xα , Yβ ] ⊗ I ′ v.

First term is zero since v is a highest weight vector. The second term is zero
by induction. Thus we have proved that Yβ ⊗ I ′ v is a highest weight vector
in an irreducible highest weight module V (ψ). Hence for weight reasons
Yβ ⊗ I ′ v = 0.
     Now consider
                            W̃ = {w ∈ V (ψ), G ′ ⊗ I ′ w = 0}

which is a non-zero submodule of V (ψ). Hence W̃ = V (ψ). This proves the
claim.
    Thus we have a module for G ′ ⊗ A/I ′ . By by Lemma 3.11 (b) we have
G ′ ⊗ A/I ′ ∼
            = G ′ where N = N1 · · · Nr . Consider h′ sitting in the ith place of
                  N
 ′
GN   which acts as linear function on the highest weight vector v of V (ψ). By
standard theory of integrable modules it follows that λi is dominant integral
weight. From the map given in Lemma 3.11 (a) it follows that
                                         X
                         ψ(h′ ⊗ tm ) =       am       ′       ′   ′
                                              Ii λi (h ) for h ∈ h .

    Towards the end of this paper we prove that the above two classes are
the only irreducible integrable modules with finite dimensional weight spaces
upto an automorphism of τ .
    We will now recall certain automorphisms of τ constructed in section
4.3 of [E1]. Let A = (aij ) 1≤i≤n be an element of GL(n, Z) the group of
                                   1≤j≤n
integral matrices of order n with determinate ±1. Let r = (r1 , · · · , rn ), s =
(s1 , · · · , sn ) ∈ Zn . Let ei = (0, · · · , 1, · · · , 0) be such that 1 on the ith place
and zero everywhere. Let Ar T = mT , AsT = dT where m, d ∈ Zn . Let
a(i) = (a1i , · · · , ani ) so that AeTi = a(i)T . T denotes the transpose. We now
define an automorphism of τ again denoted by A.


                     A(X ⊗ tr ) = X(m) A(d(tr )ts ) = d(tm ) · td

    Let (d11 , · · · , d1n ) = (AT )−1 (d1 , · · · , dn )T . Define A(di ) = d1i . It is straight-
forward to check that A defines an automorphism of τ . A does not preserve
the natural Zn −gradation of τ .
                                                                                    ◦
    We note that Z does not commute with τ but commutes with G ⊗A ⊕ Z.
In spite of this we call them central operators since they are as good as
central.
    Let V be irreducible τ module with finite dimensional weight spaces. We
have the following Lemmas.

(4.3) Lemma (1) Let z ∈ Z be a homogeneous element of degree m such
that zv 6= 0 for some v in V . Then zw 6= 0 for all non zero w in V .


    (2) The zero degree central operators Ki = Ci act by scalars

Proof Let W = {v ∈ V ; zv = 0}. Consider zX ⊗ ts v = X ⊗ ts zv = 0 for v
in W . Further zdi v = (di z + mi z)v = 0 for v in V . Hence W is a submodule



                                               31
of V . Since V is irreducible we should either have V = W or W = 0. But
we know that W 6= V and hence W = 0.
   (2) The zero degree central operators Ki leaves each finite dimensional
weight space invariant. Thus Ki has a eigenvector v of eigenvalue ℓ. Since V is
generated by v, Ki (central) should act by the same scalar ℓ everywhere. This
argument holds good for any operator on V of zero degree which commutes
with τ and leaves a finite dimensional space invariant. [QED].
   We will now prove an important lemma which is crucial for the classifi-
cation result.

(4.4.) Lemma Let z be a central operator in Z of degree m such that
z 6= 0. Then there exists a central operator T (need not be in Z) on V of
degree −m such that
                                T z = zT = Id

Proof First consider zV a non zero submodule of V . Hence zV = V . Now
given a v in V there exist a unique w in V such that zw = v. (uniqueness
follow from the fact that zw1 = 0 implies w1 = 0 by lemma 4.3 (1)). Define
T : V → V such that T (v) = w.
Then clearly zT v = zw = v. Now consider

                          z(X(r)T v) = X(r)zT v
                                       = X(r)v.

Hence by definition T (X(r)v) = X(r)T v. Thus T commutes with G ⊗ A and
hence commutes with z. In particular

                        T zv = zT v = zw = v.[QED]

                        L = {r, −r; tr Ki 6= 0 on V for some i}.

Suppose the dimension of the C linear span of L is k. Then upto an auto-
morphism of τ

  (1) there exists non-zero integers m1 , m2 , · · · , mk and nonzero central op-
       erators z1 , · · · zk such that the degree of zi is equal to (0, · · · , mi , 0 · · · 0)

  (2) k < n

  (3) tr Ki = 0 for all i and for all r such that rj 6= 0 for some k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

  (4) tr Ki = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and for all r.
                                                                ◦
  (5) There exists a proper submodule W of G A ⊕Z ⊕ Dk such that V /W
       has finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to h ⊕ Z0 + Dk where
       Dk is the linear span of

                                        {dk+1 , · · · , dn }.

Proof Let T = {z1 z2 · · · zℓ | where zi = tr Kj 6= 0 or zi = inverse of tr kj 6= 0
for some j and for some r}.
    Let L1 = {s ∈ Zn | where s is the degree of some operator in T }. Then
clearly L1 is a sub group of Zn . Now by standard basis theorem there exists
s1 , · · · sn ∈ Zn such that m1 s1 · · · mk sk is a basis of L1 for some non-zero inte-
gers mi . Now we can find an automorphism B such that Bsi = (0 · · · 1, · · · 0).
Let r i = mi si for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then Br i = (0, · · · mi , · · · 0) for i ≤ i ≤ k. So
after twisting the automorphism we can assume that there exists non-zero
central operators z1 , · · · zk , of degree (m1 , 0, · · · 0) · · · (0, · · · mk , 0 · · · 0). Let
T1 , · · · Tk be the inverse of z1 , · · · zk .

Claim 1 W1 = {z1 v − v | v ∈ V } is a proper G A ⊕Z ⊕ D1 −module.
    Note that for i 6= 1, di commutes with z1 and hence W1 is di −invariant.
                 ◦
Clearly W1 is G A ⊕Z invariant. To see that W1 is proper, just note that W1
cannot contain d1 weight vectors. Now consider W2 = {z2 v − v; v ∈ V /W }.
                                                                ◦
By above argument we can see that W2 is a proper G A ⊕Z ⊕ D2 module.
Continuing this process we see that W = {zi v − v | v ∈ V, 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is a
          ◦
proper G A ⊕Z ⊕ Dk −module.

Claim 2 Ti W = W and v − Ti v ∈ W for all v in V .
    Consider v−Ti v = zi Ti v−Ti v ∈ W . Now Ti (zj v−v) = zj (Ti v)−Ti v ∈ W .
Hence the claim 2.

Claim 3 Let λ be a weight of V . Let V λ = ⊕r Vλ+δr where the sum runs
over all r such that rk+1 = 0 · · · = rn . Let W λ = V λ ∩ W . Then M = V λ /W λ
is finite dimensional.
    To see this first recall that zi is central operator of degree mi = (0, · · · , mi , · · · , 0).
Consider

                                  S = ⊕|ri |<|mi | Vλ+δr
                               rk+1 = 0 · · · = rn .

    Since each weight space is finite dimensional it follows that S is finite
dimensional, so to prove the claim 3 it is sufficient to prove that every v in
Vλ is in S modulo Wλ . Let v ∈ Vλ+δr , r = (r1 , · · · rk , 0 · · · 0). Let

                              ri = li mi + gi , | gi |<| mi )

for gi , li ∈ Z. Note that the sign of li depends on the sign of ri and mi .
Suppose ri > 0 and mi < 0 then li ≤ 0. Suppose ri > 0 and mi < 0 then
li ≥ 0.


                                            34
   Let
                                    Y           Y
                              Z=        zi−li         Tili
                                    li <0       li ≥0

   Then by claim 2 and the definition of W we see that Zv = v modulo W
for all v in V . On the other hand it is easy to see that Zv ∈ S. Hence the
claim.
                                                  ◦
   Thus we have proved that V /W is a G A ⊕Z ⊕ Dk −module with finite
dimensional weight space with respect to h ⊕ Z0 ⊕ Dk . This provs (5).
   (3) Suppose tr Ki 6= 0 for some r and such that rj 6= 0 for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
This increases the dimension by 1. So we have (3).
   (1). Let hk be the linear span of h ⊗ tr , tr Ki for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and rj = 0
for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n and dk+1, · · · , dn . One can check that hk is solvable. In
fact [[hk , hk ], hk ] = 0. Now clearly Vλ is a submodule for hk and Wλ is a
submodule. Therefore M is a finite dimensional module for hk . Thus by Lie-
theorem there exists a vector v in M such that h(r)v = λ(h, r)v for h(r) ∈ hk .
Consider for m, d ∈ Zn such that dj = mj = 0 for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Then

           (h, h′ )d(tm )td v = [h(m), h′ (d)] v
                            = (h(m)h′ (d) − h(m)h(d))v
                            = (λ(h, m)λ(h′ , d) − λ(h′ , d)λ(h, m))
                            = 0

   Let z = d(tm )td and suppose z 6= 0 on V . Then we have proved that
there exists a non-zero vector in V /W (there is v ∈
                                                   / W ) such that zv ∈ W .
But v = z −1 zv ⊆ z −1 W ⊆ W . A contradiction. Hence z = 0. In particular
tr Ki = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k and rj = 0 for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n. (see 2.2 (1)). This
together with (3) proves (4). The second part of (1) follows from above.
   (5) Suppose k = n. Then by 4, Z has to be zero a contradiction to the
fact that k = n > 0. [QED].



                                        35
   We record here the following Lemma about the dimensions of central
operators acting on V . We will not need it anywhere but of independent
interest.

(4.6) Lemma Let z1 , z2 be non-zero central operators of degree m of an
irreducible module V of τ with finite dimensional weight space. Then z1 =
kz2 for some constant k. In particular there is at most one dimensional
non-zero central operator in a given degree.

Proof Let T1 be the inverse central operator of degree −m of z1 . Consider
z2 T1 which is of degree zero central operator and leaves a finite dimensional
space Vg (see the proof of Lemma 2.6) invariant.
   Thus it has a eigenvector v say of eigenvalue k. But v generates V and
hence z2 T1 = k on V . Now z1 k = z1 z2 T1 = z2 . Hence we are done. [QED].
   We need one more reduction modulo an automorphism of τ before we
can take up the classification problem. Recall that A ∈ GL(n, Z) defines
an automorphism of τ such that Ad(tr )ts = d(tAr ).tAs . (We are supressing
Transpose T and there is no confusion). It is easy to see that if A = (aij )

                   j=1                                                      j=1
Let Ki act on V by ki . We know that there exists k < n such that ki = 0
for 1 ≤!i ≤ k upto an automorphism of τ . Now choose A ∈ GL(n, Z), A =
  I 0
          such that I is identity matrix of order k × k and B ∈ GL(n − k, Z)
  0 B
such that B(kk+1 , · · · , kn )T = (0, · · · , 0, ℓ).

sional weight spaces. Let k be an integer as defined in Theorem (4.5). Then

upto automorphism of τ the assertions of Theorem 4.5 holds and further we
can assume Ki = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

Proof We have Theorem (4.5). Now choose A such that (4.7) holds.

 (1) Clearly holds.

(3) Claim tA(r) Ki = 0 for all i and j such that A(r)j 6= 0 for some j such
that k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n. First note that ri 6= 0 for some k + 1 ≤ i ≤ n by the
choice of A. Now by Theorem 4.5 (3) we have tr Ki = 0 for all i. Then from
(4.7) and the fact that A in invertible the claim follows.

(4) Claim tA(r) Ki = 0 1 ≤ i ≤ k for all r. From (4.7) we have the claim
by noteing that aij = 0 for j ≥ k + 1.
   2 and 5 follows from arguments similar to Theorem 4.5 (2) and (3). In
addition we can assume that A(Ki ) = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. [QED].
   We will now start eleminating several cases in order to classify integrable
irreducible modules for τ with finite dimensional weight spaces.

(4.9) Proposition Let V be irreducible integrable module for τ with finite
dimensional weight spaces. Suppose k < n−1 (see Theorem 4.5) and suppose
ki 6= 0 for some i, Then such V does not exists.

   The term tℓ−d+s            ℓ−d+s
             k+1 tn Kk+1 and tk+1 tn Kn are zero (by Theorem 4.5 (3))
being central. Thus the second and third term above are zero.
   The first term is equal to
                        X
                               ℓ−d −m d

                                 ad htk+1 tn (m + 1)tks+d Kn v

   (by 2.2) (1)).
                                                           s+d
   Fix a d0 in the above and let s = −d0 . Now from (2.1) tk+1 Kk+1 = 0 for
s + d 6= 0. And Kk+1 = 0 by Proposition (4.8). Thus the second term is zero

                                          38
                                       s+d
in the above. Now by Theorem 4.5 (3), tk+1 Kn = 0 for s + d 6= 0. Hence the
third term is zero but for d0 . The first term is zero being an highest weight.
Hence we have
                                  ℓ+s −m
                            a−s htk+1 tn · Kn v = 0

                 ℓ+s −m
(4.10) Suppose htk+1 tn v = 0. Consider

                                     −(ℓ+s) m ℓ+s −m
                         0 = h′ tk+1       tn htk+1 tn v
                            = −(h, h′ )(ℓ + s)Kk+1v
                            + m(h, h′ )Kn v

(by 2.2 (1)) and v is a highest weight. We know that Kk+1 v = 0. But
the second term is non zero. Thus (4.10) is false. This proves a−s = 0 a
contradiction. This proves our claim. Hence we have proved that under
the conditions of Proposition (4.9). Vλ+ℓδk+1 −(2m+1)δn is infinite dimensional.
This completes the proposition. [QED].

(4.11) Remark The case k = n − 1 where modules exists (see Examples
4.2) will be dealt in the next section. The case k = 0 and Ki = 0 for all i, in
which case Z = 0 is dealt in [E3].
   Now we will deal the remaining case where k ≥ 1 and Ki = 0 for all i.
   We will first recall an important result due to Futorny [F] on Hiesenberg
Lie- Algebra. Let H be a finite dimensional vector space with non-degenerate
symmetric billinear form (,). Then L(H) = H ⊗ C[t, t−1 ] ⊕ Cc is called
Hisenberg Lie-algebra with the following bracket

                     [h ⊗ tm , h′ ⊗ tℓ ] = (h, h′ )mδm+ℓ,0 C.

(4.12) Proposition (Proposition 4.3 (i) [F]). Let V be any Z−graded.
L(H)−module with finite dimensional graded spaces and center acts by


                                        39
nonzero scalars. Then V admits a graded vector v such that H ⊗ tn v = 0 for
all n > 0 (or for all n < 0).

Proof It is only proved for one dimensional H. But the proof works for any
finite dimensional H by choosing orthogonal basis for H. There it is assumed
that V is irreducible. But it is not needed for geting a highest weight (or
lowest weight) vector. [QED].

(4.13) Proposition. Let V be integrable irreducible module for τ with
finite dimensional weight spaces. Let k be as in theorem 4.5. Suppose k ≥ 1
and Ki = 0 for all i. Then such a module V does not exists.

                     ◦                                                      ◦   ◦
Proof Recall that G is finite dimensional simple Lie algebra with G= n+ ⊕ h
⊕n− . Then by Proposition (2.12) there exists a weight vector v of V such
that n+ ⊗ An v = 0. (The case n− ⊗ An v = 0 can be done similarly). Suppose
tm Ki 6= 0. Then by Theorem 4.5 (3), (4) we have i ≥ k+1 and mk+1 = 0 · · · =
mn . Let H be Hisenberg Lie-algebra spanned by htm tkn , k > 0, ht−k
                                                                  n ,k > 0
and tm Ki with Lie-braket.

                                     k ] = (h, h )kt Ki δk+ℓ0 .


Consider M the H module generated by v. Then by Proposition (4.12) there
exists w in M such that

           (a)     htm tki w = 0, k > 0 or (b)      htki w = 0 for k < 0.

Assume (a)
Now w = Xv for X ∈ U(hA ). Then it is easy to see that n+ ⊗ An w = 0. Let
λ be the weight of w.

Claim λ |h6= 0. Suppose it is zero. Let α be a simple root in △ and let

Xα , Yα , hα = [Xα , Yα ] be as sl2 − copy inside G. Then Xα ⊗ ts , Yα ⊗ t−s , hα

for integrable module Yα ⊗ t−s w = 0 for any s as λ(hα ) = 0. Thus we have
◦                                                                           ◦
G ⊗An w = 0. This implies Z is zero which is not the case. Thus λ |h6= 0.
Let α be a simple root such that λ(hα ) 6= 0. Let Xα = X, Yα = Y h = hα be
an sl2 copy. That is [X, Y ] = h, [h, Y ] = −2Y, [h, X] = 2X. Let ℓ0 be such
that

(4.14) htm − ℓ0 (X, Y )tm Ki = 0. where Xts we mean X ⊗ ts .

Claim The following infinite set of vectors are linearly independent in V .

                         {Y t−r   r
                             i Y ti w, r > 0, r 6= ℓ0 , −ℓ0 }.


Suppose there exists non-zero scalars ar such that

               ar Y t−r   r
           P
(4.15)               i Y ti w = 0. We will be using the following in the calcula-
tion below.

    (1) w is a highest weight vector

    (2) tℓi Ki = 0 which follows from definition 2.2. for ℓ 6= 0 and by assumption
        for ℓ = 0.

    (3) d(tm tℓi )t−r    m ℓ−r
                   i = rt ti Ki (by (2.2) and (2.1) and mi = 0).


Consider for r > 0

                           = htis−r htm tiℓ+r w

                           + htir+s htm ti−r+l w

   Choose ℓ such that ℓ − r > 0 which implies ℓ + r > 0. Then first three
terms, the sixth, seventh and eighth term are zero. Thus applying Xtsi Xtm tℓi
to (4.15) such that ℓ − r > 0. We have for all r
                     X
                          ar (htm tiℓ+s + s(X, Y )tm tiℓ+s )w = 0

choose s such that ℓ + s = 0. From 4.14 it follos that

         P
(4.16)       ar = 0. Now choose r0 be the maximal among r that occur in
(4.15). Now choose ℓ such that ℓ − r0 = 0, ℓ − r > 0 for r 6= r0 . This implies
ℓ + r > 0 ∀r. Again apply Xtsi Xtm tℓi to (4.15) we have

                                     X
           ar0 htri 0 +s htm w − 2       ar (htm tiℓ+s + s(X, Y )tm tiℓ+s Ki )w

                            +r0 ar0 (X, Y )tm Ki htri 0 +s w.

Now choose s such that r0 + s = 0. Then ar0 (htm + r0 (X, Y )tm ki )hw = 0.
By choice of r and the fact that hw = λ(h)w 6= 0, we conclude that ar0 = 0.
A contradiction. Thus Vλ+2α is infinite dimension.

                                             42
   (b) htki w = 0,    k < 0. Consider the set Y tri Y t−r
                                                       i , r > 0 and apply
Xtm tsi Xtℓi then we get the desired linearly independent set. [QED].


5. Section
In this section we will deal with the last case k = n − 1, Kn 6= 0 and Ki = 0
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. We will prove that in this case we will get all the modules
defined in example (4.2).

(5.1) Lemma Any Zn−1 graded simple, commutative Algebra M such that
each graded component is finite dimensional over C is isomorphic to a sub-
algebra of An−1 such that each homogeneous element is invertible.

Proof Let M = ⊕r∈Zn−1 Mr where each Mr is finite dimensional. Since
M is graded simple it follows that M0 is simple commutative Algebra of
finite dimension over C. Then clearly M0 ∼
                                         = C. Let 0 6= w ∈ Mr . The ideal
generated by w has to be M and hence there exists inverse say w −1 . Consider
w −1 Mr ⊆ C. Since w −1 w = 1 it follows that w −1 Mr = C. In particular each
non-zero Mr is C. The Lemma follows. [QED].

(5.2) Theorem Let V be irreducible integrable models for τ with finite
dimensional weight spaces. Let k be as defined in Theorem (4.5). Assume
k = n − 1 and Kn 6= 0. Then V is isomorphic to V (ψ) as defined in Example
(4.2).

Proof First note that tr Ki = 0 for all r and 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and tr Kn = 0
for all r such that rn 6= 0. Write




                                     43

                                        rn =0
spanned by tr Ki for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 for all r and tr Ki for all r such that rn 6= 0.
                ◦                                        ◦
We have N − ⊕ h ⊕CKn ⊕ Cdn ⊕ N + = Gaf =G ⊗C[tn , t−1
                                                   n ] ⊕ CKn ⊕ Cdn . We
have already noted that Z ′ acts trivially on V . By Lemma 2.3 (5) we know
that Kn acts by an integer. By an automorphism we can assume that Kn
acts by a positive integer. Now by Proposition (2.4) we get a weight vector
v in V such that

(5.4) N − ⊗ An−1 v = 0. Let h′′ be the abelian Lie-algebra spanned by
◦         X                                                         ′′
h ⊗An−1 ⊕    tr Kn . Here An−1 = C[t±            ±
                                    1 , · · · , tn−1 ]. Let M be a h ⊕ D−
            rn =0
module generaed by v.

                              ′′
Claim M is irreducible h ⊕ D−module. Let w be a weight vector of M.
                                                     ◦
Since V is irreducible there exists X ∈ U(G A ⊕Z ′ ) such that Xw = v. By
PBW theorem
                              X = X− HX+ where

X+ ∈ U(N + ⊗An−1 ), X− ∈ U(N − ⊗An−1 ) and H ∈ U(h′′ ) from (5.3). D and
Z ′ does not appear as w is a weight vector and Z ′ acts trivially. But Y v = w
                    ′′
for some Y ∈ U(h ) we can see that N + ⊗ An−1 Y v = 0. Thus X+ w = 0,
which means X+ cannot appear and by weight reasons X− cannot appear.
                                        ′′
Thus X = H which belongs to U(h ). This proves the claim.
                                                                              ′′
   Since v is a weight vector, D acts by scalar and hence M = U(h )v. So
we have M a Zn−1 graded irreducible module for h . Thus M ∼
                                                    ′′              ′′
                                                              = U(h )/I
                                   ′′
for some graded Ideal I. Since h is abelian M is Zn−1 graded simple com-
mutative algebra. Now by Lemma (5.1), M is isomorphic to a subalgebra of
                    ′′
An−1 . Let ψ : U(h ) → M = Aψ ⊆ An−1 be the quotient map which Zn−1
graded. By Proposition 3.3, we have V ∼
                                      = V (ψ). As earlier ψ = E(1) ◦ ψ
where E(1) tm = 1.

  h′ =h ⊕CKn and identify tm Kn as Kn ⊗ tm (mn = 0). Thus h′ ⊗ An−1 =h
        X
⊗An−1 ⊕    Ctm Kn . From Proposition (3.20) we have
             mn =0

                                     j=0


and m ∈ Zn−1 . Now extend each λj to h that is give some value to λj (dn )
                  P
such that ψ(dn ) = λj (dn ). It is well known that the irreducible integrable
highest weight module V (λj ) for Gaf are all isomorphic for various values
of λj (dn ). (see [K]). Now ⊗N V (λj ) ∼
                              j=1      = V (ψ) being the unique irreducible
module for the highest weight ψ. [QED].

Remark          (5.5) We need to consider more general modules than in [E3]
where center acts trivially like in our Example (4.1). Nevertheless we proved
                                                                ◦
that an irreducible integrable module (not graded) G A is actually a module
    ◦
for G ⊗A/I( Lemma (1.2) and Proposition (2.1) of [E3]) where I is a cofinite
ideal of A generated by polynomials with distinct roots. But our lemma 3.11
               ◦             ◦
(b) says that G ⊗A/I ∼  = ⊕ G. Thus in this case all irreducible integrable

modules with finite dimensional weight spaces for G A are given in Example
(4.1).
