                                                    Abstract. Using a new definition of rank for representations of semisimple groups,
                                                    sharp results are proved for the decay of matrix coefficients of unitary representations of
                                                    two types of non-split p-adic simple algebraic groups of exceptional type. These sharp
                                                    bounds are achieved by minimal representations. It is also shown that in one of the
                                                    cases considered, the minimal representation is isolated in the unitary dual.

                                                Let G be an absolutely simple affine algebraic group defined over a local field F of
                                             characteristic zero. We assume G is F-isotropic. Let G be a topological finite central
                                             extension of GF , the group of F-points of G. Fix a maximal compact subgroup K of G.
                                             Let π be a unitary representation of G. Throughout this article we will denote the Hilbert
                                             space on which π acts by Hπ . For any two vectors v, w ∈ Hπ , the matrix coefficient fv,w
                                             is the complex-valued function defined on G as
                                                                                     fv,w (g) = (π(g)v, w)
                                             where (·, ·) is the inner product of Hπ .
                                             Definition 1. A unitary representation π of G is said to be strongly Lp if and only if
                                             for any vector v in the (clearly dense) set of K-finite vectors in Hπ , we have
                                                                                       fv,v ∈ Lp (G, dg)
                                             where dg is the Haar measure on G.

                                               We say that π is strongly Lp+ε if and only if it is strongly Lq for any q > p.
                                               Cowling [Co] showed that G has property T of Kazhdan if and only if there exists
                                             a real number p < ∞, only dependent up on G, such that any non-trivial irreducible
                                             unitary representation of G is strongly Lp . The infimum of all such numbers p is called
                                             the minimal decay of G [LZ, Oh]. We denote this infimum by p(G). The exact value of
                                             p(G) is known for classical real Lie groups [Li]. For exceptional groups some estimates
                                             are obtained in [Oh, LZ]. It is known that p(G) = 6 when G is of absolute type G2 .
                                             Recently, Loke and Savin [LS] used a notion of N-rank developed by Weissman [Ws] for
                                             simply-laced groups to find p(G) when G is a split exceptional simply-laced group.

                                               We use Tits’ notation in [Ti] to identify simple groups over p-adic fields. The main
                                             point of this paper is to prove the following statement:

                                            , and the minimal representation of E97,4 is
isolated in its unitary dual endowed with the Fell topology.
Remarks.
1. We will see that the decay bounds are achieved by minimal representations of these
groups.

2. Although the notion of N-rank used by Savin is defined in a way quite different from
the one introduced by the author, much of the methods used by Savin and the author
are similar, and based on Howe’s original ideas [Hw1]. The main result of [LS] follows
from the method of this paper as well. On the other hand, the result of this paper does
not follow from the work of Loke and Savin since there is no parabolic with an abelian
unipotent radical when the relative root system is of type F4 . However, for the sake of
brevity, we do not include the calculations for split groups here. Besides, we address
some issues about the minimal representations which are not addressed in full generality
in [GS1]. Therefore, this paper is essentially a complement to the papers [GS1] and [LS].

                      2. Rank of a unitary representation
  In this section we simply recall the definition of the notion of rank introduced in [Sa]
and the main result about purity of rank proved there.

   Let G be as in section 1. Throughout this section we assume that G satisfies proper-
ties (H0) through (H3) of [GS1, Section 3]. Take G1 = G and let P1 be the Heisenberg
parabolic of G, as defined in [GS1],[Ws] ,[Sa]. Let P1 = L1 N1 be the Levi decomposition
of P1 . N1 is a Heisenberg group unless G1 is of type A1 .

  Note that in terms of relative root systems, the center of N1 corresponds to the highest
root β of the relative root system of G, and N1 includes all unipotent subgroups Uγ
correpsonding to relative roots γ ∈ S where

(2.1)                             S = {γ : (γ, β) > 0}
with (·, ·) being the Killing form. There exists a unique simple relative root α ∈ S.

   Suppose L1 is isotropic. Then the relative root system of L1 is either simple or of the
form A1 ×R or A1 ×A1 ×R. Let G2 = [L1 , L1 ] when [L1 , L1 ] is simple, and otherwise let
G2 be equal to the simple factor of [L1 , L1 ] which corresponds to the system R, and let
P2 = L2 N2 be the Heisenberg parabolic of G2 . Again if L2 is isotropic we can consider
its simple factor G3 and the Heisenberg parabolic P3 = L3 N3 of G3 , and so on. The
unipotent subgroup

(2.2)                             NG = N1 · N2 · N3 · · ·
of G is in fact the unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup of G. NG is a tower of ex-
tensions by Heisenberg groups; however, the last group in the sequence can be an abelian

group.

   One can also construct a family of representations of G in a similar fashion. Any irre-
ducible unitary representation of a Heisenberg group over a local field belongs to one of
the following classes. The first class consists of characters, i.e. representations which act
trivially on the center of the group. The second class consists of those representations
which have a non-trivial central character. By the Stone-von Neumann theorem, the
elements of this class are uniquely determined by their central characters. See [Hw2] or
[Ty] for more details.

  Now let H be a Heisenberg group, and let χ be an arbitrary non-trivial character of
the center of H. Denote the unitary representation with this central character by ρχ .


Definition 3. ([Sa, Section 4]) Let NG be as in (2.2) with height r = rNG ; i.e.
                                       NG = N1 · N2 · · · Nr .
Let ρχi be the extension of a representation of Ni with central character χi to NG 1. Any
representation of the form ρχ1 ⊗ ρχ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρχk is called a rankable representation of NG
of rank k.


  The following proposition is a special, more polished form of the main result in [Sa,
Section 5.2].
Proposition 4. Let G, NG be as in Definition 3. Suppose rNG > 2. Let π be a unitary
representation of G without a G-fixed vector. Then the spectral measure for the direct in-
tegral decomposition of π|NG is supported on rankable unitary representations. Moreover,
if π is irreducible, then exactly one of the following cases can occur:
        i. The spectral measure is supported on rankable representations of rank one.
       ii. The spectral measure is supported on rankable representations of rank strictly
           larger than one.
Therefore, the following definition of rank, given in [Sa, Definition 5.2.3], distinguishes
the representations of rank one from other representations.
Definition 5. Let G be as in section 1, NG be as in (2.2), and π be an irreducible unitary
representation of G. π is said to have rank k if and only if the spectral measure in the
direct integral decomposition of π|NG is supported on rankable representations of G of
rank k.


                                   3. Matrix coefficients
  Let G be as in section 1 with maximal compact subgroup K. Let B be the minimal
parabolic of G and A the split torus of G. Since G = BK, for any g ∈ G there exists
an element b = b(g) ∈ B (unique modulo B ∩ K) such that b−1 g ∈ K. Let δG be the

normal subgroup N1 · · · Ni−1 .

modular function of B. The Harish-Chandra function Ξ, which is the spherical matrix
coefficient of IndG
                  B (1), is equal to
                                           Z 1

                                          +
Note that δG (a) assumes values in R , so it is identically equal to 1 on compact sub-
groups of B; i.e. δG (b(g)) is well defined.

Definition 6. Let π be a unitary representation of G. Let K be the maximal compact
subgroup of G, and let Ψ be a positive integer-valued function whose domain is equal to
the set K̂ of the equivalence classes of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of K.
                  1
We say π is (Ξ k , Ψ)-bounded if and only if for any K-finite vectors v, w ∈ Hπ which
belong to K-isotypic spaces of νv , νw ∈ K̂, we have
                                               1
                                 |fv,w (g)| ≤ Ξ k (g)Ψ(νv )Ψ(νw ).
    Let t > 1. It is known (e.g. [Kn, Prop. 5.2.8] and [Si, Lemma 4.1.1]) that if
                      At = {a ∈ A : |α(a)| ≥ t for any positive root α}
then for any a ∈ At we have
                                         1                     1
(3.2)                            CδG (a) 2 ≤ Ξ(a) ≤ Ct δG (a) 2 .
Proposition 7. Let G be as in section 1 and K be the maximal compact of G. Let Ξ be
defined as in (3.1), and Ψ(ν) be an arbitrary function from the K-types to Z+ .
                             1
      1. The subset of (Ξ k , Ψ)-bounded representations of G is closed in the unitary dual
         of G. Any such representation π is strongly L2k+ε .
      2. Let π be a unitary representation of G which is strongly Lp+ε . Let k be a positive
                                                 1
         integer such that p ≤ 2k. Then π is (Ξ k , dim(ν))-bounded.
Proof. These are restatements of Howe’s results in [Hw1] in general form. Use (3.2) for
the first part. For the second part see [Hw1, Corollary 7.2].                        

function of the minimal parabolic of the reductive group A · Hi .

of G such that π|Hi is strongly Lpi +ε . Let ki ’s be positive integers such that 2ki ≥ pi .
Suppose

                       p+ε
Then π is strongly L         .
Proof. This follows from [Li, Theorem 3.1] or [Oh, Prop. 2.7].                             

                4. Minimal representations of archimedean groups
  In this section and the next one we address the classification of rank one and minimal
representations. The classification of such representations in the classical case is already
known by the work of Howe, J.-S. Li and Vogan. Here we study exceptional groups.
Therefore, in this section we assume G is as in section 2, but also of exceptional type.

  The traditional definition of minimal representations is different for the archimedean
and non-archimedean case. A notion of a weakly minimal representation is introduced in
[GS1, Definition 3.6] in the non-archimedean case. In fact, that definition simply means
that the representation is of rank one in the sense of Definition 5 above. Therefore it is
quite natural to generalize it to the archimedean case as well. In fact, as seen below, this
new definition of the minimal representation agrees with the traditional one which is in
terms of the Joseph ideal.

   Let G be as in section 2, and let π be a unitary representation of G. Suppose P
is the Heisenberg parabolic of G. By Mackey theory [Ma], π|P is a direct integral of
representations of the form

(4.1)                                     IndP[P,P ](νχ ⊗ ρχ )
where νχ is a representation of [P, P ] which factors through [P, P ]/N, and ρχ is an ex-
tension of the representation of N with central character χ to [P, P ]. Note that χ is
supposed to be a nontrivial unitary character. Since the action of the split torus of G on
the center of N has only finitely many orbits, π|P will be a finite direct sum of represen-
tations of the form given above.

  We now recall the definition of the minimal representation in the archimedean case.
For simplicity let us assume F = R. The complex case can be treated similarly. Let g◦
be the Lie algebra of G, with complexification g = g◦ ⊗ C. g has a complex Heisenberg
parabolic subalgebra p with Levi decomposition

(4.2)                                         p = l ⊕ h.
Note that h will be the complexification of the Lie algebra of N where P = LN. Let
m = [l, l]. Assume g is not of type Al , and let J◦ be the Joseph ideal of U(g). For the
definition of the Joseph ideal, see [Jo] or [GS2].

  Let U(h) be the universal enveloping algebra of h. Define the map
                                           Θ : m 7→ U(h)
as follows 2. Let
                                       h=W ⊕z
where W is a symplectic space and z is the center of h. Denote the symplectic bilinear
form of W by ω(·, ·). We can identify spn with the symplectic Lie algebra sp(W ). There
is a canonical map
                                sp(W ) 7→ (W ∗ ⊗ W ∗ )S2
  2This   neat description is borrowed from [GS1].
6                                     HADI SALMASIAN

where S2 is the symmetric group on two elements ( i.e. S2 = {±1}), which is defined by
sending an element A ∈ sp(W ) to the bilinear form
                                    ωA (x, y) = ω(Ax, y).
Using ω, we can identify W ∗ with W by sending any y to the linear form y 7→ ω(x, y).
Thus we have a map
                                  sp(W ) 7→ (W ⊗ W )S2 .
Since there is a natural map (W ⊗ W )S2 7→ U(h), we obtain a composition map A 7→ nA
from spn to U(h). Now set
                                                1
                                      Θ(X) = nX .
                                                2
We have
                               [Θ(X), Θ(Y )] = ZΘ([X, Y ]).
   By [Sa, Prop. 3.1.1], we can consider m as a Lie subalgebra of a complex symplectic Lie
algebra spn which acts in the usual way on the Heisenberg algebra h (see [Hw1, Section
1]). Thus we can define Θ(X) for any X ∈ m.
Lemma 9. Let J be a primitive ideal of infinite codimension in U(g). Let l be as in
(4.2) and m = [l, l]. Suppose J contains ZX − Θ(X) for all X ∈ m. Then J is the
Joseph ideal.
Proof. This follows immediately from [GS1, Proposition 4.3] and the uniqueness of the
Joseph ideal [GS2].                                                                
Definition 10. Let G be as above (i.e. F = R). An irreducible unitary representation
π of G is called minimal iff the annihilator of the Harish-Chandra module associated to
π is the Joseph ideal.
Proposition 11. Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of G. π is a minimal
representation if and only if π is rank one (in the sense of Definition 5).
Proof. Let π be a representation of G of rank one. We will show that π is a minimal
representation. Intuitively, the proof is as follows. Let dπ denote the infinitesimal g-
action. By Mackey theory, the restriction of π to G is a finite direct sum of representations
given in (4.1). But the representations νχ will be of rank zero, i.e. they are trivial [P, P ]
modules. Consequently, for some m, we have

and therefore a similar equality should be true for each d̟i and also for dπ; i.e.

(4.6)                           ZX − Θ(X) ∈ AnnU (g) (π).
The result now follows from Lemma 9.

  We now have to give a rigorous proof of (4.6). Let Hπ be the Hilbert space of the
representation π, and Hπ∞ be its subset of G-smooth vectors.

Let ̟ ∈ {̟1 , ..., ̟m }. We have the following lemma.
                                                                            ∞
Lemma 12. Let H̟ denote the Hilbert space of the representation ̟, and let H̟ be the
set of P -smooth vectors in H̟ . Then
                                                           ∞
                    d̟(ZX − Θ(X))v = 0 for any X ∈ m, v ∈ H̟ .
                      ∞
Proof. Recall that H̟    is a space of smooth left-quasi-[P, P ]-invariant functions on P
                                                                                       ∞
where P acts on it by the right regular representation. Let X ∈ m. Take any f ∈ H̟       .
Let e be the identity element of P , and denote the right action of p ∈ P on H̟ by Rp .
Thus ̟(p) is equal to Rp .
  Let MX = ZX − Θ(X). For any p ∈ P we have
                       (d̟(MX )f ) (p) = (d̟(Ad(p)(MX ))(Rp f ))(e)
                     = dρψ (Ad(p)(MX ))(f (p)) = dρp−1 ·ψ (MX )(f (p)).
Here p · ψ(x) = ψ(p−1 xp) as usual. An application of (4.5) completes the proof.          
                                                           ∞
   By Lemma 12, d̟(ZX − Θ(X))v = 0 for any v ∈ H̟            . Since π|P is a (finite or in-
finite) direct sum of representations unitarily equivalent to ̟, the algebraic sum of the
                                                                                          ∞
spaces of P -smooth vectors will be a norm-dense P -invariant subspace of the space Hπ
of P -smooth vectors in Hπ . However, by a result of Poulsen [Po], this space is dense in
                           ∞                                                        ∞

           ∞
Hπ∞ ⊆ Hπ , which proves that π is a minimal representation in the sense of Definition
10.

  Now we address the converse. Let π be a minimal representation in the sense of
Definition 10. We think of π|P as a representation of P̃ ◦ , the universal cover of the
connected component of identity of P . Again by Mackey theory, we can express π|P̃ ◦ as
                                         m
                                         M                     ◦
                              π|P̃ ◦ =         νχi ⊗ IndP̃[P̃ ◦ ,P̃ ◦ ] ρχi
                                         i=1

where now νχi ’s will be representations of L̃◦ . If π is minimal, then Lemma 12 implies
that the actions of dνχi ’s have to be zero; i.e. νχi ’s have to be trivial modules. This
proves that π is a rank one representation.

                                                                                          

                 5. Classification of rank one representations
  Let G be as in section 2 and also assume G is of exceptional type. Let P = LN be
the Heisenberg parabolic of G. Let π be an irreducible representation of G of rank one.
8                                    HADI SALMASIAN

Then we have a decomposition as in (4.3) with νχi ’s being trivial modules. Let sα be
the reflection inside the relative Weyl group of G which corresponds to the simple root
α ∈ S (see (2.1) ). By Mackey’s subgroup theorem [Ma] one can see that
Lemma 13. If ̟i and ̟j correspond to different orbits of the split torus on the center
of N, then ResPP ∩sαP s−1
                       α
                          ̟i and ResPP ∩sα P s−1
                                              α
                                                 ̟j are non-isomorphic irreducible represen-
                               −1
tations of the group P ∩ sα P sα .
   Let π be an irreducible representation of G of rank one. From the irreducibility claimed
in Lemma 13 it follows that if T is a bounded operator from the space of π to itself and
it commutes with all π(g) for g ∈ P ∩ sα P s−1α , then it commutes with all π(g) for g ∈ P
as well. For a similar reason, T should commute with all π(g) for g ∈ sα P s−1   α as well.
However, P and sα P s−1 α  generate G;  therefore  T should  be an intertwining operator of
the irreducible representation π, which means that T is a scalar. Consequently, we have
proved that the only intertwining operators of π|P ∩sα P s−1
                                                           α
                                                              are scalars. This means that
π|P should be irreducible; i.e. π|P = ̟ for some ̟ = ̟i . Moreover, π(sα ) will be the
intertwining operator between two irreducible representations of P ∩ sα P s−1α , and there-
fore π(sα ) will be determined uniquely. Therefore once we know the restriction of π to
P , there is at most one way to extend it to a representation of G.

Proposition 14. Let G be as above. Suppose the absolute root system of G is of ex-
ceptional type and G has split rank at least 3. Then there is a unique representation of
rank one of G, unless G is a Hermitian form of E7 (i.e. F = R), in which case there are
exactly two such representations.
Proof. From the discussion above, and the fact that representations ̟i correspond to
distinct orbits of the center of N, the proposition follows from the number of orbits of
the split torus on the center of N. Consider the smallest subspace of the Lie algebra of
G which contains the one-dimensional space of the highest root and is invariant under
the action of the rank-one subgroup corresponding to α. It is either the two-dimensional
representation of SL2 (F) or a 10-dimensional representation of SO(9, 1) (in the real
Hermitian case). In the former case, the split torus of SL2 (F) has one orbit, so there can
be at most one minimal representation in each case. The representations are constructed
in [Tor]. In the latter case, there are two orbits. The two minimal representations are
constructed in [Sah].
                                                                                          

                       6. Decay of minimal representations
  As we mentioned in the introduction, the method of this paper can be used to show
that the minimal representation is isolated for all simply-laced exceptional groups as
well as two non-split exceptional p-adic groups. However, the details for the case of split
groups is not included here since the author noticed that it was done simultaneously in
[LS].

   The non-split p-adic groups under consideration will be the F-points of simply con-
nected algebraic groups of absolute types E6 and E7 which have Tits index 2 E26,4 and
E97,4 . They are of relative type F4 , and the dimension of short root spaces are 2 and 4
respectively. By Proposition 14 the minimal representation is unique in each case, and

all other nontrivial irreducible unitary representations are of rank two or larger. The
minimal representations have Iwahori-fixed vectors and the exponents of these repre-
sentations are calculated in [GS1, Section 8]. By a standard result relating the matrix
coefficients to the exponents (e.g. see [Cs, Section 4]), one can calculate the precise Lp
decay of the minimal representations. Let the restricted Dynkin diagram of G be labelled
by α1 , ..., α4 such that the highest root β is

                                β = 2α1 + 3α2 + 4α3 + 2α4 .
Note that this is different from the labelling chosen by Lusztig and also used in [GS1]. Let
us choose a minimal parabolic B of G, and therefore identify the positive Weyl chamber
of the split torus A.

   Let πmin denote the (unique) minimal representation of G, as constructed in [GS1].
We use the calculation of exponents of πmin given in [GS1, Section 8]. See [GS1, Section
6] for the definition of and basic results on exponents. The following statement follows
from standard facts (see [Cs, Section 4] or [Hw3]).
                                                                                    1
                                                                                        − p1
        ♦ πmin is strongly Lp+ε if and only if for every exponent µ of πmin , δG2              (a)µ(a) is
          bounded on the negative Weyl chamber.
We treat each case separately below.

          Just as before, it follows that πmin is strongly Lp+ε if and only if p ≥    3
                                                                                        .

                    7. Minimal decay and isolatedness of πmin
   In this section we complete the prove of Theorem 2. Let G be one of the two groups
introduced in the previous section. Let Hi , i ∈ {1, 2} be defined as follows.

⋄ H1 is the rank one subgroup corresponding to the highest root β.

⋄ H2 is the subgroup corresponding to all roots perpendicular to the highest root (i.e.
its relative diagram is the subdiagram C3 of F4 ).

Lemma 15. Let G, Hi (i ∈ {1, 2}) be as above. Let π be an irreducible unitary represen-
tation of G which is not the trivial or the minimal representation. Then π|H1 is strongly
L2+ε and π|H2 is strongly L4+ε .
Proof. For i = 1, this follows from [Oh, Theorem 4.1]. We prove the lemma for i = 2.

  As before, let P = LN be the Heisenberg parabolic of G. Using Mackey theory as in
(4.1), π|[P,P ] can be expressed as a direct integral of representations of the form
                                   ResP[P,P ]IndP[P,P ](ν ⊗ ρ).
Let M = [L, L]. Since π is not minimal, it follows from Proposition 14 that π has to be
of rank at least two.Therefore π|M is a direct integral of representations of the form

(7.1)                                       νχ ⊗ ρ′χ
where νχ is a representation of M of rank at least one, i.e. it does not have a nonzero
M-fixed vector, and ρ′χ is given as
                                                  [P,P ]
                                       ρ′χ = ResM ρχ
where ρχ is the extension of the representation of N with central character χ to M using
the construction of the oscillator representation [We]. Although the central character χ
can be arbitrary, there will be only finitely many representations ρ′χ (at most equal to the
number of elements of F × /(F × )2 ). Therefore π|M is a finite direct sum of representations
of the form given in (7.1), and moreover since π is of rank at least two, none of the νχ ’s
can have trivial subrepresentations.

   Suppose νχ is strongly Lp+ε and ρ′χ is strongly Lq+ε . Then by an application of Hölder’s
inequality, one can see that νχ ⊗ ρ′χ is strongly Lr+ε where 1r = 1p + 1q , and if this is true
for all the direct summands of π then π|M will be strongly Lr+ε as well. Therefore what
remains to be done is to find suitable values of p and q such that 1p + 1q ≥ 14 . To this end
we use [LZ, Prop. 2.2] followed by [Oh, Lemma 7.3].

  Let Φ(a) denote the function introduced in [LZ, Prop. 2.2]; i.e. Φ is an upper bound
on the matix coefficients of the set of K-finite vectors in the restriction of the oscillator
representation to M.

    Let α1 , ..., α4 be simple roots of the Dynkin diagram of G numbered such that the
  highest root is
                                  β = 2α1 + 3α2 + 4α3 + 2α4 .
                                                                                               −3
  Let a ∈ AH2 and let yi = |eαi (a)|. Since |eβ (a)| = 1, we have |eα1 (a)| = y2 2 y3−2 y4−1.
  Therefore a simple calculation shows that
                                                        −3r−5             −r−3

  where r is the dimension of a short root space.

    Note that by [Oh, lemma 7.3], we have:
  ♦ ρ′χ is strongly Lp+ε if and only if the exponent of any yi in Φp (a)δH2 (a) is nonpositive.
    On the other hand,

                                         δH2 (a) = y23r+3y36r+4 y44r+2.
    Therefore

  and consequently,

                                                    7
    For G = 2 E26,4 the lemma is already proved, since one can definitely take p < ∞ (be-
  cause H2 has property T ). For E97,4 , it follows from [Oh, Theorem 7.4] that p ≤ 18. Note
  that although Oh’s result is stated for irreducible unitary representations, it is easily seen
  to hold for any unitary representation without a nonzero fixed vector. It is not hard to
              7    1
  check that 36 + 18  = 41 ! This proves the lemma for i = 2.

          Proposition 8 implies that any nontrivial and non-minimal irreducible represen-
          tation of G is strongly L8+ε ; i.e. p(G) ≤ 8. By the result of section 6 we should
          have p(G) = 8.

•E97,4 : We have
                                                              1    1              21     11
                           δG (a) = y134 y266 y396 y452 and δH2 1 δH4 2 (a) = y1 y24 y39y42 .


          Again we conjugate the groups by w = sα4 sα1 sα2 sα3 sα2 sα1 and we get
              1        1              9   35   25
            δH2 1w (a)δH4 2w (a) = y12 y24 y32 y47

          which gives r ≤ 192
                           25
                              < 8. Therefore, any non-minimal irreducible representation of
                                               1
                         8+ε
          G is strongly L , and therefore (Ξ 4 , dim(ν))-bounded. However, by Proposition
                                                                1
          7, the minimal representation of G can not be (Ξ 4 , dim(ν))-bounded since it is
          not strongly L8+ε . Therefore the complement of the set {trivial, πmin} is a closed
          set in the unitary dual of G; i.e. πmin is isolated as well. Moreover, by section 6,
          p(G) = 263
                     .
