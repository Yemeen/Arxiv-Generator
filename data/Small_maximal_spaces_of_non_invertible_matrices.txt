                                                                                    Abstract
                                                The (generic) rank of a vector space A of n × n-matrices is by definition the
                                             maximal rank of an element of A. The space A is called rank-critical if any matrix
                                             space that properly contains A has a strictly higher rank. I present a sufficient
                                             condition for rank-criticality, and apply this condition to prove that the images of
                                             certain Lie algebra representations are rank-critical.
                                                A rather counter-intuitive consequence is that for infinitely many n, there exists
                                             an 8-dimensional rank-critical space of n × n-matrices having generic rank n − 1, or,
                                             in other words: an 8-dimensional maximal space of non-invertible matrices. This
                                             settles the question, posed by Fillmore, Laurie, and Radjavi in 1985, of whether
                                             such a maximal space can have dimension smaller than n. As another corollary, I
                                             prove that the image of the adjoint representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is
                                             rank-critical.

                                                                                   1. Results
                                                This paper deals with linear subspaces of End(V ), the space of K-linear maps
                                             from an n-dimensional vector space V over a field K into itself. The (generic) rank
                                             of such a subspace A, denoted rk A, is by definition the highest rank of an element
                                             of A, and we call A rank-critical if any linear subspace B of End(V ) that properly
                                             contains A has rk B > rk A. Note that a space A is maximal among the singular
                                             spaces—that is, those that only contain non-invertible matrices—if and only if A
                                             is rank-critical of rank n − 1; in this case we call A a maximal singular space. The
                                             main results of this paper are the following.
                                             Theorem 1. Let K be a field of characteristic zero, let m be an integer ≥ 3, and
                                             let e be a positive integer. Then the image of the representation of slm (K) on the
                                             space V = K[x1 , . . . , xm ]em of homogeneous polynomials of degree em is a maximal
                                             singular subspace of End(V ).

                                                In particular, taking m = 3, we find that for every n of the form 3e+2
                                                                                                                          

                                             there exists an 8-dimensional maximal singular space of n × n-matrices.
                                             Theorem 2. For any semisimple Lie algebra g over a field of characteristic zero,
                                             ad g is a rank-critical subspace of End(g).
                                               Theorems 1 and 2 are consequences of the following proposition.

Proposition 3. Let A be a subspace of End(V ) and suppose that |K| > rk A =: r.
Set Areg := {A ∈ A | rk A = r} and define the space
           RND(A) := {B ∈ End(V ) | B ker A ⊆ im A for all A ∈ Areg }.
Then RND(A) ⊇ A, and if equality holds, then A is rank-critical. If, moreover, a
group G acts linearly on V and if A is stable under the conjugation action of G on
End(V ), then RND(A) is also a G-stable.
   The proof of Proposition 3 in Section 3 bases on an elementary, but useful
sufficient condition for maximality of vector spaces in an arbitrary affine variety
embedded in a vector space. In Section 4, we apply Proposition 3 to images of Lie
algebra representations; Theorems 1 and 2 are proved there. Section 5 lists some
computer results on rank-criticality of semisimple Lie algebra representations—in
particular, Theorem 2 came up as a conjecture using this computer program.

                        2. Introduction and Motivation
  The direct motivation for this paper is the question, posed by Fillmore et al in
1985 [6], of whether a maximal singular subspace of End(V ) can have dimension
smaller than n. I briefly review three well-known constructions of maximal singular
spaces that led them to raise this question.
Example 4. Fix subspaces W, U of V of dimensions k − 1 and k, respectively, and
set A := {A ∈ End(V ) | AU ⊆ W }. Then A is a singular space of dimension
k(k − 1) + (n − k)n = n2 − kn + k 2 − k. Moreover, it not hard to see that A
is maximal. We follow Eisenbud and Harris [5] in calling A and all its subspaces
compression spaces, as they ‘compress’ U into W .
Example 5. Suppose that n is odd, take V = K n , and let A be the space of all
skew-symmetric matrices. As any skew-symmetric matrix has even rank, the space
A is singular, and it was observed in [6] that A is maximal for all odd n ≥ 3, under
the assumption that |K| ≥ 3. It is easy to see that A is not a compression space.
  In both examples above, the dimension of A is quadratic in n. An ingenious
construction of smaller maximal singular spaces is the following, attributed to Bob
Paré in [6] and also appearing in [15].
Example 6. Take V = K n and fix n skew-symmetric n × n-matrices A1 , . . . , An .
Let φ be the linear map from K n into the space Mn (K) of n × n-matrices over K
sending x to the matrix with columns A1 x, A2 x, . . . , An x. Then φ(K n ) is a singular
space in Mn (K) because xt φ(x) = 0 for all x ∈ K n . Moreover, in the particular
case where |K| ≥ 3, Ai = Ei,i+1 − Ei+1,i for i < n, and An = En,1 − E1,n , Fillmore
et al showed that A is maximal [6].
   Many results in the literature exhibit sufficient conditions for a singular space
A to be a compression space: Dieudonné [3] showed that every singular space of
dimension ≥ n2 − n either has a non-trivial common kernel or is dual to a space
with a common kernel. Under the assumption that |K| is at least 2n − 2, this
result is sharpened as follows in [6]: if the dimension of A is > n2 − 2n + 2 (which
               SMALL MAXIMAL SPACES OF NON-INVERTIBLE MATRICES                            3


is the dimension of a compression space with k = 2), then A or its dual has a
common kernel. A condition of a different kind is that A be spanned by rank one
matrices; then a combinatorial argument shows that is a compression space [15, 10].
Analogues of these questions for (skew-)symmetric matrices and for rank-critical
spaces have also been studied extensively in the literature [1, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16].
   Yet another result of this type is part of the Kronecker-Weierstrass theory of
matrix pencils [9] for K = C. I give a short proof that is valid for other fields, as
well.
Proposition 7. Suppose that |K| ≥ n = dim V . Then any two-dimensional singu-
lar subspace of End(V ) is a compression space.
Proof. If A, B ∈ End(V ) are such that KA+KB is singular, then the homogeneous
polynomial p(s, t) := det(sA+tB) vanishes on all |K|+1 points of P1 (K). As p(s, t)
has degree n < |K| + 1, it must be identically zero, so that sA + tB has a non-zero
vector u(s, t) in K[s, t] ⊗K V in its kernel. But then any non-zero homogeneous
component of u(s, t), say of degree d, is also annihilated by sA + tB; hence we find
u0 , . . . , ud ∈ V such that (sA + tB)(sd u0 + sd−1 tu1 + . . . + td ud ) = 0, where we may
assume that u0 6= 0. Taking the of coefficients of sd+1 , sd t, . . . , td+1 , we find
         Au0 = 0, Au1 = −Bu0 , . . . , Aud = −Bud−1 , and Bud = 0.
                                                        P
      P every element of KA + KB maps the space U := i Kui into the space
But then
W := i KAui , which is strictly smaller because Au0 = 0 while u0 6= 0. 
   Example 13 below shows that the condition on |K| in this proposition is nec-
essary. This proposition, another proof of which is given in [5] for algebraically
closed fields, shows that if |K| ≥ n > 2, then a maximal singular space cannot have
dimension 2. On the other hand, Example 6 shows that there do exist maximal
singular spaces in End(V ) of dimension dim(V ), and this led Fillmore et al to put
forward their question above.

            3. Maximality of vector spaces in affine varieties
   Let K be a field and let M be a vector space over K. Denote by L an algebraic
closure of K and set M (L) := L ⊗K M . Let Z be an affine algebraic variety in
M (L) defined over K, and let N be a K-vector subspace of M contained in Z(K).
We want a sufficient condition for N to be maximal among the subspaces of M
contained in Z(K). Therefore, set
                         U := {m ∈ M (L) | N (L) + Lm ⊆ Z};
then U is an affine variety defined over K. We make the following assumption:
(*)                 ∀m ∈ M (L) : N + Km ⊆ Z(K) ⇒ m ∈ U (K);
in particular, 0 lies in U (K) and so N (L) ⊆ Z.
Lemma 8. Suppose that Z is defined by polynomials f1 , . . . , fk ∈ K[M ]. Then
|K| > maxi deg fi implies (*). If, moreover, the fi of highest degree are homoge-
neous, then |K| ≥ maxi deg fi already implies (*).
Proof. Suppose that m ∈ M satisfies N + Km ⊆ Z(K), and let n1 , . . . , nd be a
K-basis of N . Then we have for all i
               fi (t1 n1 + . . . + td nd + sm) = 0 for all t1 , . . . , td , s ∈ K.

But a polynomial of degree < |K| cannot vanish everywhere on an affine space over
K unless it is the zero polynomial. Hence if deg fi < |K|, then the left-hand side is
the zero polynomial in t1 , . . . , td , s and vanishes on Ld+1 , as well. We conclude that
then m ∈ U ∩ M = U (K), whence the first statement. For the second statement,
note that a homogeneous polynomial of degree ≤ K cannot vanish everywhere on
a projective space over K unless it is the zero polynomial.                              
   By (*), maximality of N among the subspaces of M contained in Z(K) is equiv-
alent to U (K) = N , and a sufficient condition for this is clearly U = N (L). In
principle, this condition can be verified using Gröbner basis techniques, but U may
be hard to compute even for moderately complicated Z. We therefore set out to
find linear sufficient conditions, as follows: Let Zreg be the set of smooth points of
Z, and set Nreg := N ∩ Zreg , N (L)reg := N (L) ∩ Zreg . The second assumption we
make is
(**)                                      Nreg 6= ∅.
Now let                                           \
                              TN (L)reg Z :=                Tn Z
                                               n∈N (L)reg
be the intersection of all tangent spaces to Z at points of N (L)reg , where each Tn Z
is viewed as a vector subspace (through the origin) of M (L). Then we have the
following lemma.
Lemma 9. The L-vector space TN (L)reg Z contains U . In particular, if TN (L)reg Z =
N (L), then N (L) is maximal among the L-subspaces of M (L) contained in Z.
Proof. For m ∈ U and n ∈ N (L)reg the line {n + tm | t ∈ L} lies in Z, and a
fortiori m is tangent to Z at n. We conclude that m ∈ TN (L)reg Z, as claimed. The
second statement is immediate.                                                  
    We want a K-rational version of this lemma. To this end, we define
                                \                    \
              TNreg (Z(K)) :=       ((Tn Z)(K)) = (       Tn Z)(K),
                                 n∈Nreg                      n∈Nreg

where the second equality follows from the fact that Z, and therefore every Tn Z, is
defined over K. Note that TNreg (Z(K)) contains (TN (L)reg Z)(K), as the intersection
is taken over a smaller set.
Proposition 10. The K-vector space TNreg (Z(K)) contains U (K). In particular, if
TNreg (Z(K)) = N , then N is maximal among the K-vector subspaces of M contained
in Z(K).
Proof. If m ∈ U (K), then by the previous lemma m ∈ (TN (L)reg Z)(K), which space
is contained in TNreg (Z(K)); this shows the first statement. The second statement
is now immediate from assumption (*).                                           
   A randomised algorithm to compute the tangent space TNreg Z(K) bases on the
following observation.
Proposition 11. For all non-negative integers l and e, the set of (n1 , . . . , nl ) ∈
 l
Nreg for which
                                \l
                          dimK     (Tni Z)(K) ≥ e

                SMALL MAXIMAL SPACES OF NON-INVERTIBLE MATRICES                                5


is the set of K-rational points of a closed subvariety of N (L)lreg .
Proof. Let d be the dimension of Z and let γ : Zreg → Grd (M (L)) be the Gauss map
sending a point of Z to its tangent space. Now the set of all l-tuples (T1 , . . . , Tl ) ∈
Grd (M (L))l whose intersection has dimension at least e is closed in Grd (M (L))l ,
hence so is its pre-image under (γ|Nreg )×l . The set of the proposition is the set of
K-rational points of this pre-image.                                                      
   For dimension reasons, the space TNreg Z(K) is the intersection of finitely many
tangent spaces Tni Z(K), i = 1, . . . , m with ni ∈ Nreg . Now if K is large (in
particular, if K is infinite), then the preceding proposition suggests the following
randomised algorithm to compute TNreg Z(K): First, find an upper bound on m,
and second, choose m elements of N at random. These are probably smooth points
by (**), and by the preceding proposition the intersection of their tangent spaces is
probably equal to TNreg Z(K). In particular, if this intersection is equal to N , then
you are sure that N is a maximal vector space in Z(K). This algorithm was used
to produce computational evidence for Theorem 2, see Section 5. For the second
half of Proposition 3 we need the following.
Proposition 12. Suppose that a group G acts K-linearly on M , that N is G-
stable, and that Z is stable under the corresponding L-linear action on M (L). Then
TNreg Z(K) is a G-submodule of M .
Proof. Let m ∈ TNreg Z(K), g ∈ G, and n ∈ Nreg . Then g −1 n ∈ N ∩ Zreg =
Nreg , and g maps the K-rational tangent space (Tg−1 n Z)(K) isomorphically onto
(Tn Z)(K). As m lies in the former by assumption, gm lies in the latter. This shows
that gm ∈ TNreg Z(K).                                                            
   We will apply Proposition 10 to the setting of Section 1: M = End(V ), where
V is a vector space over K, N = A is a subspace of End(V ) of generic rank r,
and Z = Rr is the variety of L-linear maps V (L) → V (L) of rank at most r. The
following example shows that assumption (*) is not automatic here.
Example 13. Suppose that K is a finite field with q elements labelled c1 , . . . , cq .
Then the 2-dimensional subspace A of Mq+1 (K) spanned by the diagonal matri-
ces A = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1, 0) and B = diag(c1 , c2 , . . . , cq , 1) is singular—i.e., lies in
Rq (K)—but A(L) is not.
   We avoid this anomaly as follows: Rr is defined by the (r + 1) × (r + 1)-minors of
matrices, which are homogeneous polynomials of degree r + 1. Hence, if we assume
that |K| ≥ r + 1, then assumption (*) is automatically fulfilled by Lemma 8; in
particular, the rank of A(L) is then also r. Moreover, the smooth points of Rr
are the linear maps of rank exactly r, and by assumption A contains such maps,
so that assumption (**) is also satisfied. The space TAreg Rr (K) will be denoted
RND(A), and its elements will be called rank-neutral directions of A. We recall a
useful characterisation of the tangent spaces to Rr at smooth points.
Lemma 14. For A ∈ Rr (K) of rank r, the tangent space (TA Rr )(K) is equal to
{B ∈ End(V ) | B ker A ⊆ im A}.
Proof. This is well known [11, Example 14.16]; I only give an intuitive argument:
For B to lie in TA Rr , it is necessary and sufficient that there be, for every v ∈ ker(A),
a vector w ∈ V for which (A + ǫB)(v + ǫw) = 0 modulo ǫ2 . The coefficient of ǫ
6                                       JAN DRAISMA


in this expression is Aw + Bv, so that the existence of such a w is equivalent to
Bv ∈ im(A).                                                                    
  Proposition 3 is now a direct consequence of Proposition 10, Lemma 14, and
Proposition 12.
Example 15. Proposition 3 provides another proof of rank-criticality of compres-
sion spaces (under the condition |K| ≥ n). Indeed, in the notation of Example 4,
suppose that B ∈ End(V ) does not map U into W , and let u ∈ U be such that
Bu 6∈ W . It is not hard to construct an A ∈ A with ker A = Ku and im A 6∋ Bu.
But then B 6∈ (TA Rn−1 )(K) by Lemma 14 and we conclude that RND(A) = A.

                   4. A construction of rank-critical spaces
   The singular space of Example 5 is closed under the commutator, and so are
the compression spaces of Example 4 if W ⊆ U .1 This suggests the study of the
following situation: Let G be an affine algebraic group defined over K, and let
ρ : G → GLK (V ) be a finite-dimensional representation defined over K. Let g be
the Lie algebra of G, and denote the corresponding representation g → End(V )
also by ρ. Set r := rk ρ(g) and suppose that |K| ≥ r + 1. Now G acts on End(V )
by gA := ρ(g)Aρ(g)−1 , and both ρ(g) and the variety Rr of linear maps of rank
≤ r are G-stable. Proposition 3 implies: the rank-neutral directions of ρ(g) form
a G-module, and if RND(ρ(g)) = ρ(g), then ρ(g) is rank-critical. In the rest
of this section we assume that char K = 0, so that we can use the well-known
representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras to construct rank-critical spaces.
Example 16. Recall Example 5. Here G is the group On of orthogonal matrices,
g = on , ρ is the identity, and V = K n is the standard on -module. It is well known
that End(V ) is the direct sum of three irreducible On -modules: the space on of
skew-symmetric matrices, the scalar multiples of the identity I, and the space of
symmetric matrices with trace 0. We now use Lemma 14 to show that the last two
modules are not contained in RND(on ): Choose
                                                                 
                                                             0 0
                   Y := diag(1, −1, 0, . . . , 0) and X :=          ,
                                                             0 X′
where X ′ ∈ on−1 has full rank n − 1. Then neither I nor Y maps ker X into
im X, hence the On -modules that they represent are not contained in RND(on ).
We conclude that RND(on ) = on , so that on is maximal singular.
   Suppose now that g is semisimple and that it has a split Cartan subalgebra
h. Then V is the direct sum of its h-weight spaces Vλ , λ ∈ h∗ , and we have r =
dim V − dim V0 . Furthermore, we choose a Borel subalgebra b of g containing h.
We can then compute, for each b-highest weight λ of End(V ), the multiplicity of λ
among the highest weights in RND(ρ(g)); see Section 5.
   If, moreover, K is algebraically closed, then the rank-neutral directions of ρ(g)
can be characterised as follows:
                                                   M
(***)      RND(ρ(g)) = {Y ∈ End(V ) | (gY )V0 ⊆        Vλ for all g ∈ G}.
                                                           λ6=0

    1Note that this property is not preserved under the multiplication from the left and from the
right with arbitrary invertible matrices—however, deciding whether a given subspace A of End(V )
is GL(V ) × GL(V )-conjugate to a Lie algebra is easily reduced to a linear problem.

                                                                                     L
Indeed, a generic element of ρ(h) has kernel V0 and image V1 :=                         λ6=0 Vλ , so
that the inclusion ⊆ follows from Lemma 14. On the other hand, if any map
in the G-orbit of Y maps V0 into V1 , then Y is tangent to Rr at all points of
{gX | g ∈ G, X ∈ ρ(h) with ker X = V0 and im X = V1 }. This set is dense in
ρ(g)reg , and because the set {X ∈ ρ(g)reg | Y ∈ TX Rr } is closed in ρ(g)reg , we
conclude that Y ∈ RND(ρ(g)). We now proceed with the proof of Theorem 1.
     Let g be the Lie algebra slm (K), let k be a natural number, and let ρ : g →
End(V ) be the representation of g on the k-th symmetric power V = S k ((K m )∗ )
of (K m )∗ , i.e., on the homogeneous polynomials on K m of degree k. Let h ⊆ g be
the Cartan subalgebra of diagonal matrices and let b ⊇ h be the Borel subalgebra
of upper triangular matrices. The image of ρ is spanned by the (restrictions to V
                                       ∂                     ∂         ∂

                                           , i 6= j, and xi ∂x i
                                                                 − xj ∂x j
                                                                           , where the latter span
ρ(h). The weight spaces in V are one-dimensional and spanned by the monomials
xa1 1 · · · xamm with a1 + . . . + am = k. The highest root vector in ρ(g) is xm ∂x         ∂
                                                                                              1
                                                                                                . To
apply Proposition 3, we compute the highest weight vectors in End(V ).
Lemma 17. The highest weight vectors in End(V ) = V ⊗ V ∗ are precisely the
            ∂ d
powers (xm ∂x 1
                ) for d = 0, . . . , k.
Proof. It is clear that these are (non-zero) highest weight vectors; that there are
no others follows by a dimension computation. Alternatively, the lemma is an easy
application of the Littlewood-Richardson rule [8].                               

    The space ρ(g) is singular if and only if k is a multiple of m, say k = em, and
then xe1 xe2 . . . xem spans the zero weight space. The space ρ(slm ) has no chance of
being maximal singular if m = 2 (unless k=2), as then dim(V ) = k + 1 = 2e + 1 is
odd and SL2 leaves invariant a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on V ; ρ(g)
is then contained in the larger singular space of linear maps that are skew relative
to this bilinear form. This explains the condition m ≥ 3 in Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 1. First, if the image of g is maximal singular over a larger field,
then it is also maximal singular over K; so it suffices to prove the theorem for K
algebraically closed. By Proposition 3, Lemma 17, and the characterisation (***)
of RND(ρ(g)) it suffices to prove that if d 6= 1, then some element of the SLm -orbit
        ∂ d
of (xm ∂x 1
            ) does not map xe1 · · · xem into the space spanned by all other monomials.

Lemma 18. For any integers e > 0 and d ∈ {0} ∪ {2, 3, . . . , 3e} the polynomial

is not divisible by α + β + γ.
Proof. First, P0,e = 1 is not divisible by α + β + γ; suppose next that d ≥ 2e. Then
the highest monomial in Pd,e with respect to the lexicographic order with α >
β > γ is αe β e γ d−2e . Rewriting Pd,e as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric
polynomials σ1 := α + β + γ, σ2 := αβ + βγ + γα, and σ3 := αβγ will therefore give
the monomial σ3d−2e σ23e−d a non-zero coefficient. Hence P is not divisible by σ1 .
   If 1 < d < 2e, then we claim that the coefficient of αd−1 β in Pd,e (α, β, −α − β)
is non-zero. Indeed, this coefficient is readily seen to equal Qd−1 , where
                                  d              

                                       a    a   d − a        a + 1
Automatic summation using Zeilberger-Wilf theory and the Maple-package EKHAD8
[2, 17] yields the following expression for Qd :
                    (e + k)(e + k − 1) · · · (e − k + 1)
           
           (−1)k                                                if d = 2k − 1, and
           
           
     Qd =                     k · ((k − 1)!)2
                            (e + k)(e + k − 1) · · · (e − k + 1)
           (−1)k (2e + 1)                                       if d = 2k.

           
                                       k · ((k − 1)!)2
In particular, we find that Qd is non-zero for 1 ≤ k ≤ e, so that the coefficient of
αd−1 β in Pd,e (α, β, −α − β) is in fact non-zero for 2 ≤ d ≤ 2e + 1. This concludes
the proof of the lemma.                                                             
    We now prove rank-criticality of the images of adjoint representations.
Proof of Theorem 2. Again, it suffices to prove the theorem in the case where K is
algebraically closed. We will prove RND(ad(g)) = ad(g) and then apply Proposition
3. Therefore, let A be a rank-neutral direction of ad(g) and let x ∈ g have centraliser
gx of minimal dimension; then Agx ⊆ [x, g] by Lemma 14. In particular, we find
that if [x, y] = 0, then the Killing form κ of g vanishes on (x, Ay). As the commuting
variety of g is irreducible [18], this implies that κ(x, Ay) = 0 for all x, y ∈ g with
[x, y] = 0, independent of dim gx . Now consider the space
        M (g) := {A ∈ End(g) | κ(x, Ay) = 0 for all x, y ∈ g with [x, y] = 0};
we claim
     L that it is equal to ad(g). First, assume that this is true for simple g, let
g = i gi be a decomposition ofL  g into simple ideals, let A ∈ M (g), and let y ∈ gi .
Then Ay is κ-perpendicular to      j6=i gj , so Ay ∈ gi . In other words, every gi is
A-stable, and of course A|gi ∈PM (gi ). By assumption there exist zi ∈ gi such that
A|gi = adgi zi , and then A = i adg (zi ).
   It remains to prove M (g) = ad(g) for simple g. For sl2 this is easy, so we may
suppose that g has rank ≥ 2. Setting x = y in the condition on A, we see that
M (g) ⊆ o(κ), the orthogonal Lie algebra defined by κ. Moreover, M (g) is stable
under conjugation with any automorphism of g, and this implies two things: first,
that M (g) is a g-module and second, using the Chevalley involution of g, that it is
self-dual as such. Now the g-module o(κ)/ ad(g) is irreducible if g is not of type A—
its highest weight can be determined explicitly but is not of interest to us—while it
               SMALL MAXIMAL SPACES OF NON-INVERTIBLE MATRICES                                 9


is a direct sum W ⊕ W ∗ for some non-self-dual module W if g is of type A. In any
case, M (g) is either ad(g) or o(κ). But M (g) 6= o(κ): choose for instance x, y in (a
Cartan subalgebra of) g satisfying [x, y] = 0 and κ(x, x) = κ(y, y) = 1 − κ(x, y) = 1
and let A be the map sending x to y, y to −x, and the κ-orthogonal complement of
hx, yiK to 0; then A ∈ o(κ)\M (g). We conclude that M (g) = RND(ad(g)) = ad(g),
as claimed.                                                                         

                              5. Some computer results
  To compute the G-module RND(ρ(g)), where ρ : g → End(V ) is a finite-
dimensional representation of a split semisimple Lie algebra g over a field K of
characteristic 0, we use the following algorithm based on Proposition 11:
    (1) Compute the non-zero highest weight spaces HWµ of End(V ) relative to a
        Borel subalgebra b and a split Cartan subalgebra h contained in b; this is
        elementary linear algebra.
    (2) For each of them, say HWµ of dimension l, choose l random elements
        X1 , . . . , Xl ∈ ρ(g), verify that they have maximal rank, and compute the
        subspace
                  {Y ∈ HWµ | Y ker Xi ⊆ im Xi for all i = 1, . . . , l}.
    (3) The dimension of this space is the multiplicity of µ among the highest
        weights in RND(ρ(g)). Well, more precisely, it is an upper bound to this
        multiplicity, which with high probability is sharp.
   If we find that the multiplicity of every highest weight in RND(ρ(g)) is equal
to its multiplicity in ρ(g), then ρ(g) is rank-critical by Proposition 3. I list some
examples, found by computer experiments with this algorithm.
    (1) The images of the adjoint representations of split simple Lie algebras of
        types A1 , . . . , A4 , B2 , . . . , B4 , C3 , C4 , and G2 were proved rank-critical with
        this algorithm. This computational evidence led to the formulation of The-
        orem 2.
    (2) The image of the 26-dimensional representation of F4 is rank-critical (of
        rank 24).
    (3) Let g be split simple of type G2 and let ρ be the 7-dimensional repre-
        sentation of highest weight [1, 0], with zero weight multiplicity 1. Then
        RND(ρ(g)) is equal to o7 , which of course is still singular, so ρ(g) is not a
        maximal singular space.
    (4) Similarly, if g is of type G2 and ρ is the 27-dimensional representation
        of highest weight [2, 0] with zero weight multiplicity 3, then RND(ρ(g)) is
        equal to φ(o7 ), where φ is the representation of o7 of highest weight [2, 0, 0],
        which restricts to ρ on g. As both ρ(g) and φ(o7 ) have generic rank 24, the
        former is not rank-critical but the latter is.
    (5) Let ρ be the 35-dimensional irreducible representation of g = sl3 of highest
        weight [4, 1]. Then RND(ρ(g)) is a sum of three irreducible modules of
        highest weights [1, 4], [1, 1], and [4, 1]. Hence, Proposition 3 cannot be ap-
        plied to conclude rank-criticality. Note that by the results of Dynkin [4] the
        image of ρ is a maximal subalgebra of sl35 , so that there is no easy argument
        as in the previous two examples, that shows that ρ(g) is not rank-critical.
  Theorem 2 was first conjectured on the basis of (1).

                       6. Conclusion and further questions
    Representations of semisimple Lie algebras yield an abundance of rank-critical
matrix spaces, which suggests that the (commonly believed to be intractable) clas-
sification of such spaces may in some sense include the classification of Lie algebra
representations. In particular, among the representations of sl3 we found infin-
itely many where the image of sl3 is a maximal singular space. The matrix spaces
A constructed this way actually satisfy an a priori stronger condition than rank-
criticality, namely: A = RND(A). These results pose many questions for further
research, of which the following seem most interesting.
     (1) Directly describe, given the highest weights in a representation ρ of a split
         semisimple Lie algebra g, the highest weights in the g-module RND(ρ(g)).
         The present proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are somewhat ad hoc, and the
         algorithm of Section 5 is computationally rather intensive, so that it only
         works for representations of dimensions at most 50 or so.
     (2) Investigate the discrepancy between rank-criticality and the condition A =
         RND(A).
     (3) For mn the minimal dimension of a maximal singular space of n × n-
         matrices, determine lim inf n→∞ mn (which is larger than 2 and at most
         8, as we have seen, while—to the best of my knowledge—it was previously
         believed to be infinite) and lim supn→∞ mn .
     (4) Investigate whether the maximal singular spaces of Theorem 1 remain max-
         imal modulo primes, and, more generally, whether rank-critical spaces con-
         structed in Section 4 remain rank-critical modulo primes.
