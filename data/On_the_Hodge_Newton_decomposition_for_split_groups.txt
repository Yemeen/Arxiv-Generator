                                                                              1. Introduction
                                               The main purpose of this paper is to prove a group-theoretic generalization of
                                            a theorem of Katz on isocrystals. Along the way we reprove the group-theoretic
                                            generalization of Mazur’s inequality for isocrystals due to Rapoport-Richartz, and
                                            generalize from split groups to unramified groups a result from [KR] which deter-
                                            mines when the affine Deligne-Lusztig subset XµG (b) of G(L)/G(oL ) is non-empty.
                                               Let F be a finite extension of Qp with uniformizing element ̟. We write L
                                            for the completion of the maximal unramified extension of F in some algebraic
                                            closure F̄ of F . We write σ for the Frobenius automorphism of L over F , and we
                                            write o (respectively, oL ) for the valuation ring of F (respectively, L).
                                               Let G be a split connected reductive group over o and let A be a split maximal
                                            torus of G over o. Fix a Borel subgroup B = AU containing A with unipotent
                                            radical U , as well as a parabolic subgroup P of G containing B. Write P = M N ,
                                            where M is the unique Levi subgroup of P containing A and N is the unipotent
                                            radical of P .
                                               We write XG for the quotient of X∗ (A) by the coroot lattice for G, and we define a
                                            homomorphism wG : G(L) → XG as follows. For g ∈ G(L) we define rB (g) ∈ X∗ (A)
                                            to be the unique element µ ∈ X∗ (A) such that g ∈ G(oL ) · µ(̟) · U (L), and we
                                            define wG (g) to be the image of rB (g) under the canonical surjection from X∗ (A) to
                                            XG . (This definition of wG suffices for the purposes of this paper; see §7 of [Kot97]
                                            for a definition that applies to groups G that are not split over L.)
                                               Applying the construction above to M rather than G, we obtain XM , the quo-
                                            tient of X∗ (A) by the coroot lattice for M , and a homomorphism
                                                                             wM : M (L) → XM .
                                                                        P
                                            For µ, ν ∈ XM we write µ ≤ ν if ν − µ is a non-negative integral linear combination
                                            of (images in XM of) coroots α∨ , where α ranges over the roots of A in N .
                                               We write AP for the identity component of the center of M ; thus AP is a split
                                            torus over F . Let aP denote the real vector space X∗ (AP ) ⊗Z R. As usual P
                                            determines an open chamber a+ P in aP , defined by

                                                         a+
                                                          P := {x ∈ aP : hα, xi > 0 for every root α of AP in N }.

                                            The composition X∗ (AP ) ֒→ X∗ (A) ։ XM , when tensored with R, yields a canon-
                                                                                         +
                                            ical isomorphism aP ≃ XM ⊗Z R. We write XM     for the subset of XM consisting
                                            of all elements whose image in XM ⊗Z R ≃ aP lies in a+

  For any coweight µ ∈ X∗ (A) (usually taken to be dominant) and any b ∈ G(L)
we consider the affine Deligne-Lusztig set
(1.1)      XµG (b) := {x ∈ G(L)/G(oL ) : x−1 bσ(x) ∈ G(oL )µ(̟)G(oL )}.
For b ∈ M (L) we may replace G by M in this definition, obtaining the affine
Deligne-Lusztig set XµM (b); moreover, the inclusion M (L)/M (oL ) ֒→ G(L)/G(oL )
induces an inclusion
                                XµM (b) ֒→ XµG (b).
Theorem 1.1. Let µ ∈ X∗ (A) be a dominant coweight, and let b be a basic element
                                              +
in M (L) such that wM (b) lies in the subset XM of XM .
                                                       P
    (1) [RR96] If XµG (b) is non-empty, then wM (b) ≤ µ. Here we are regarding µ
        as an element of XM .
    (2) Suppose that wM (b) = µ (with µ again regarded as an element of XM ).
        Then the natural injection XµM (b) ֒→ XµG (b) is a bijection.
   See [Kot85] for the definition of basic. The first part of the theorem is a refor-
mulation of the group-theoretic generalization of Mazur’s inequality (see Theorem
1.4.1 of [Kat79]) proved by Rapoport-Richartz [RR96]. Proposition 4.10 shows that
our formulation agrees with that of [RR96]. The second part of the theorem is the
group-theoretic generalization of Katz’s theorem (see Theorem 1.6.1 of [Kat79])
which was formulated in [KR, Remark 4.12] and proved there for GLn and GSp2n
as a consequence of Katz’s theorem.
   The theorem above is proved in §3. In §4 it is generalized to the case of unramified
groups (see Theorem 4.1 for a precise statement). Theorem 4.3 determines (for any
unramified G) when the affine Deligne-Lusztig set XµG (b) is non-empty, generalizing
Proposition 4.6 of [KR], which treated the case of split groups.
   We now draw the reader’s attention to some related work. In [FR02] (respec-
tively, [KR]) the converse to Mazur’s inequality is proved for GLn (respectively,
GLn and GSp2n ). Recently C. Leigh [Lei02] has proved the converse to Mazur’s
inequality for all split classical groups. The reader who would like to know how
these questions relate to the reduction modulo p of Shimura varieties should consult
the survey article [Rap02] by Rapoport.
   It is a pleasure to thank M. Rapoport, both for the interest he has taken in this
work and the helpful comments he made about a preliminary version of the paper.

                                  2. Retractions
2.1. Notation. Let o be a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction field F ,
uniformizing element ̟, and residue field k = o/̟o.
   Let G be a split connected reductive group over o and let A be a split maximal
torus of G over o. We denote by B = B(A) the set of Borel subgroups of G
containing A (all of which are defined over o). For B ∈ B denote by B̄ the Borel
subgroup in B that is opposite to B. For B,B1 ,B2 , . . . in B we denote the unipotent
radical by U ,U1 ,U2 , . . . , so that (for instance) B = AU . We write K for G(o).
2.2. Definition of retractions. For g ∈ G(F ) and B = AU in B we define
rB (g) ∈ X∗ (A) to be the unique element µ ∈ X∗ (A) such that g ∈ K · µ(̟) · U (F ).
The family (rB (g))B∈B of retractions is used by Arthur to form weighted orbital
integrals.

2.3. Positivity properties of families of retractions. The family (rB (g))B∈B
has the following basic positivity property [Art76, Lemma 3.6],[HC66, Lemma 85].
Let B1 = AU1 and B2 = AU2 be adjacent Borel subgroups in B, and let α be the
unique root of A that is positive for B1 and negative for B2 . Then
(2.1)                         rB2 (g) − rB1 (g) = j · α∨ ,
where j is a non-negative integer that we will now define. (We will not recall
the proof except to say that one reduces to the case of SL(2), for which a simple
computation with 2 × 2 matrices does the job.)
   The group U1 is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup U1 ∩ U2 and the
root subgroup Uα determined by α. In particular Uα is a quotient of U1 , and we refer
to the image of u1 ∈ U1 in Uα as the α-component of u1 . Choosing an isomorphism
between Uα and Ga over o, we may view the α-component of u1 ∈ U1 (F ) as an
element of F , well-defined up to multiplication by a unit.
   Now we can define j. Decompose g as g = k · u1 · µ(̟) with k ∈ K, u1 ∈ U1 (F )
and µ ∈ X∗ (A) (so that µ = rB1 (g)), and write x ∈ F for the α-component of u1 .
Then j is defined to be 0 if x ∈ o and is defined to be − val(x) if x ∈
                                                                      / o.
   The basic positivity property above has some obvious consequences. One is that
for any B1 , B2 ∈ B the coweight rB2 (g) − rB1 (g) is a non-negative integral linear
combination of coroots α∨ that are positive for B1 and negative for B2 . Thus for
any B, B ′ ∈ B we have
                                      B          B
(2.2)                         rB (g) ≤ rB ′ (g) ≤ rB̄ (g),
         B
where µ ≤ ν (for coweights µ,ν) means that ν − µ is a non-negative integral linear
combination of coroots that are positive for B.

2.4. Recognizing the subset K · M (F ) of G(F ) using retractions. Let M be
a Levi subgroup of G containing A and note that M is automatically defined over o.
We write XM for the quotient of X∗ (A) by the coroot lattice for M . For example,
when M = A, we have XM = X∗ (A).
Lemma 2.1. Let g ∈ G(F ). Then g ∈ K · M (F ) if and only if rB1 (g) and rB2 (g)
are equal in XM for all B1 , B2 ∈ B.
Proof. Assume first that g = km with k ∈ K and m ∈ M (F ). We must show that
all the retractions of g are equal in XM . For any B ∈ B the intersection B ∩ M is a
Borel subgroup of M , and it is clear that rB (g) = rB∩M (m). Thus, for B1 , B2 ∈ B
the coweight rB2 (g)−rB1 (g) is a non-negative integral linear combination of coroots
α∨ for M that are positive for B1 and negative for B2 , and in particular rB2 (g) =
rB1 (g) in XM .
   Now assume that all the retractions of g are equal in XM . Choose B = AU in B
and choose a minimal gallery
(2.3)                      B = B0 , B1 , . . . , Bl−1 , Bl = B̄
of Borel subgroups in B joining B to B̄. Thus l is equal to the number of positive
roots for B, and the subgroups Bi , Bi+1 are adjacent for 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1. Write
Bi = AUi and put Vi := U ∩ Ui . Note that V0 = U and Vl = {1}. We will prove by
induction on i (for 0 ≤ i ≤ l) that g ∈ K · Vi (F ) · M (F ). The case i = 0 is obvious
and the case i = l is the statement of the lemma.

   For the induction step we suppose that for some i less than l we have g = kum
for k ∈ K, u ∈ Vi (F ), m ∈ M (F ). The group Vi is the semidirect product of the
normal subgroup Vi+1 and the root subgroup Uα , where α is the unique root of A
that is positive for Bi and negative for Bi+1 . If α is not a root of M , then α∨ is
a non-torsion element in XM , and our hypothesis that the retractions for Bi and
Bi+1 are equal in XM ensures that the α-component uα of u lies in Uα (o), so that
we can write g = (kuα ) · u−1
                           α u · m ∈ K · Vi+1 (F ) · M (F ). If α is a root of M , then
we can write g = k · uu−1
                        α  · uα m ∈ K · Vi+1 (F ) · M (F ).                           
2.5. Review of two relations between the Iwasawa and Cartan decompo-
sitions. We now recall two results of Bruhat-Tits. Fix B ∈ B and a B-dominant
coweight µ ∈ X∗ (A). Suppose that g ∈ K · µ(̟) · K. Then (see [BT72, 4.4.4]) for
all B ′ ∈ B
                                              B
(2.4)                                  rB ′ (g) ≤ µ
and if rB (g) = µ, then g ∈ K · A(F ).
  Note that (2.2) and (2.4) together yield
                                         B            B
(2.5)                            rB (g) ≤ rB ′ (g) ≤ µ
for all B ′ ∈ B, so that the hypothesis rB (g) = µ implies that all the retractions of g
are equal; therefore the second result of Bruhat-Tits follows from the first together
with Lemma 2.1. This proof of their second result (different from the one given in
[BT72]) has the advantage that it generalizes immediately to parabolic subgroups,
as we now check.
2.6. Variant (for parabolic subgroups) of the two results of Bruhat-Tits.
Fix B = AU ∈ B as well as a parabolic subgroup P of G containing B. Write
P = M N , where M is the unique Levi subgroup of P containing A and N is the
unipotent radical of P . As before we write XM for the quotient of X∗ (A) by the
                                                          P
coroot lattice for M . For µ, ν ∈ XM we write µ ≤ ν if ν − µ is a non-negative
integral linear combination of (images in XM of) coroots α∨ , where α ranges over
the roots of A in N (or, equivalently, U ).
   As in the previous section, fix a B-dominant coweight µ ∈ X∗ (A) and an element
g ∈ K · µ(̟) · K. It follows immediately from (2.4) that
                                              P
(2.6)                                  rB ′ (g) ≤ µ
for all B ′ ∈ B, where the two sides of this inequality are now viewed as elements
in XM .
Lemma 2.2. With µ, g as above assume further that rB (g) is equal to µ in XM .
Then g ∈ K · M (F ). Moreover, writing g = km for k ∈ K and m ∈ M (F ), then
m ∈ KM · µ(̟) · KM , where we have written KM for M (o).
Proof. Let B ′ ∈ B. Since (by (2.5))
                                        P             P
(2.7)                            rB (g) ≤ rB ′ (g) ≤ µ,
our hypothesis that rB (g) = µ in XM implies that rB (g) = rB ′ (g) in XM for all
B ′ ∈ B. Therefore Lemma 2.1 implies that g ∈ K · M (F ).
   Now we write g as km and verify the second statement of the lemma. By the
Cartan decomposition for M there exists a unique coweight ν ∈ X∗ (A) that is
           ON THE HODGE-NEWTON DECOMPOSITION FOR SPLIT GROUPS                        5


dominant with respect to the Borel subgroup B ∩ M of M and is such that m
lies in KM · ν(̟) · KM . By the Cartan decomposition for G the coweights µ and
ν lie in the same orbit of the Weyl group of A in G. Since both µ and ν are
dominant for M , no root hyperplane for M separates µ from ν. Therefore µ − ν
is a non-negative integral linear combination of coroots α∨ , for α ranging through
the roots of A in N ; on the other hand it is clear that µ and ν are equal in XM
(since µ = rB (g) = rB∩M (m) and m ∈ KM ν(̟)KM ); therefore µ = ν, showing
that m ∈ KM · µ(̟) · KM , as desired.                                             

     3. Generalizations of Mazur’s inequality and Katz’s theorem
3.1. Notation. In the rest of the paper F denotes a finite extension of Qp and o
denotes the valuation ring of F . We write L for the completion of the maximal
unramified extension of F in some algebraic closure F̄ of F . We write σ for the
Frobenius automorphism of L over F , and we write oL for the valuation ring of L.
3.2. A lemma about σ-L-spaces. Recall that a σ-L-space is a pair (V, Φ) con-
sisting of a finite dimensional vector space V over L and a σ-semilinear bijection
Φ : V → V . In case F = Qp a σ-L-space is an isocrystal, and the theory of σ-L-
spaces is completely parallel to that of isocrystals. In particular there are finitely
many rational numbers, called slopes, attached to (V, Φ) (see §3 in [Kot85]).
Lemma 3.1. Let (V, Φ) be a σ-L-space and assume that all its slopes are strictly
positive.
    (1) For any v ∈ V the sequence Φn v approaches 0 as n → +∞.
    (2) Suppose that Λ is an oL -lattice in V such that ΦΛ ⊂ Λ, and suppose that v
         is an element of V such that v − Φv ∈ Λ. Then v ∈ Λ.
Proof. We begin by proving the first part of the lemma. Choose a positive integer
j such that jr ∈ Z for every slope r of (V, Φ). Then, in a suitable basis for V
the map Φj can be represented by a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are
strictly positive powers of the uniformizing parameter ̟ for F , and it is clear
that Φjm v ′ → 0 as m → +∞ for every v ′ ∈ V . Taking for v ′ the j vectors
v, Φv, . . . , Φj−1 v, we see that Φn v → 0, as desired. Now we prove the second part
of the lemma. It follows from the first part of the lemma that we may define an
additive homomorphism Ψ : V → V by Ψ = 1 + Φ + Φ2 + Φ3 + . . . and hence that
the additive homomorphism 1 − Φ is bijective with inverse Ψ. Also, it is clear from
the definition of Ψ that ΨΛ ⊂ Λ.
   We are given v ∈ V such that (1 − Φ)v ∈ Λ. Applying Ψ, we conclude that
v ∈ ΨΛ ⊂ Λ, as desired.                                                            
3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.1. In the proof of Theorem 1.1 we will need the follow-
ing non-abelian analog of Lemma 3.1.
Lemma 3.2. Let µ ∈ X∗ (A) be a dominant coweight, and let b be a basic element
                                                +
in M (L) such that wM (b) lies in the subset XM    of XM . Assume further that
b ∈ M (oL )µ(̟)M (oL ). Write Φ for the automorphism n 7→ bσ(n)b−1 of N over L.
Let n ∈ N (L) and assume that n−1 Φ(n) ∈ N (oL ). Then n ∈ N (oL ).
Proof. Conjugation by M (oL ) preserves N (oL ), and since µ is dominant, we have
µ(̟)N (oL )µ(̟)−1 ⊂ N (oL ); it follows that bN (oL )b−1 ⊂ N (oL ) and hence that

Φ on Lie N (L) are strictly positive. Indeed, since b is basic in M (L), these slopes
are given by hα, wM (b)i, where α ranges through the roots of AP on Lie(N ), and
wM (b) denotes the image of wM (b) in aP . Thus, if N is abelian, we have only to
appeal to Lemma 3.1.
   In the general case we need to choose an M -stable filtration
(3.1)                  N = N0 ⊃ N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Nr = {1}
by normal subgroups with Ni /Ni+1 abelian for all i. Each Ni is A-stable, hence
is a product of root subgroups and is necessarily defined over o. We will prove by
induction on i (0 ≤ i ≤ r) that n ∈ Ni (L) · N (oL ). For i = 0 this statement is
trivial, and for i = r it is the statement of the lemma. It remains to do the induction
step. So suppose that for 0 ≤ i < r we can write n as n = ni no for ni ∈ Ni (L)
and no ∈ N (oL ). Then n−1    i Φ(ni ) ∈ Ni (oL ). So (by Lemma 3.1) the image of ni in
(Ni /Ni+1 )(L) lies in (Ni /Ni+1 )(oL ). Since Ni (oL ) maps onto (Ni /Ni+1 )(oL ), we
see that ni can be written as ni+1 n′o with ni+1 ∈ Ni+1 (L) and n′o ∈ Ni (oL ). Thus
n = ni+1 · (n′o no ) ∈ Ni+1 (L)N (oL ), as desired.                                   

  Now we are ready to prove the main theorem for split groups.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let g ∈ G(L) and suppose that
(3.2)                         g −1 bσ(g) ∈ KL µ(̟)KL ,
where we have written KL for G(oL ). Use the Iwasawa decomposition to write g
as mnk for m ∈ M (L), n ∈ N (L) and k ∈ KL . It follows from (3.2) that
(3.3)                           n1 m1 ∈ KL µ(̟)KL ,
where m1 := m−1 bσ(m) ∈ M (L) and n1 := n−1 m1 σ(n)m−1
                                                    1  ∈ N (L). We claim
that
(3.4)                           wM (b) = rB (n1 m1 ),
with the right side being regarded as an element of XM . Indeed,
(3.5)                     wM (b) = wM (m1 ) = rB∩M (m1 ),
which in turn is equal to the image in XM of rB (n1 m1 ).
                                                     P
   We conclude from (2.6), (3.3), (3.4) that wM (b) ≤ µ, which proves the first part
of the theorem.
   Now we prove the second part of the theorem. Under the hypothesis that
wM (b) = µ (and with g, m, n, m1 , n1 as above), we must prove that g ∈ M (L) · KL .
It follows from (3.3), (3.4) and Lemma 2.2 that n1 m1 ∈ KL · M (L). Therefore
n1 ∈ KL · M (L), say n1 = k2 m2 with k2 ∈ KL and m2 ∈ M (L). Then n1 m−1        2 ∈
P (oL ), and therefore n1 ∈ N (oL ) and m2 ∈ M (oL ). Since n1 ∈ N (oL ), the second
statement of Lemma 2.2 applies to n1 m1 , and hence m1 ∈ M (oL )µ(̟)M (oL ).
   Now applying Lemma 3.2 (not to the element b, but to its σ-conjugate m1 ,
which satisfies the same hypotheses as b), we see that n ∈ N (oL ). Therefore
g = m · nk ∈ M (L)KL , and we are done, since we have already seen that
(3.6)                  m−1 bσ(m) = m1 ∈ M (oL )µ(̟)M (oL ).
                                                                                     
           ON THE HODGE-NEWTON DECOMPOSITION FOR SPLIT GROUPS                       7


                               4. Unramified groups
   It is easy to generalize Theorem 1.1 from the case of split groups to that of
unramified groups, in other words, quasi-split groups G over F that split over L.
There is no need to generalize the results in §2, since we will apply them to the
group G over L, where it becomes split.
   Continuing with unramified G, we will then determine precisely which affine
Deligne-Lusztig sets (1.1) are non-empty, generalizing Proposition 4.6 of [KR].

4.1. Notation. We will now change notation slightly, to emphasize that our max-
imal torus is no longer assumed to be split. We consider a Borel subgroup B = T U
of G, where T is a maximal torus in B and U is the unipotent radical of B; all
these subgroups are assumed to be defined over o. In addition we fix a parabolic
subgroup P = M N containing B, with M containing T ; again all these subgroups
are assumed to be defined over o.
   We denote by AP the maximal split torus in the center of M , and we write aP
for X∗ (AP ) ⊗Z R. In the special case P = B, we often write A and a rather than
AB and aB ; of course A is simply the maximal split torus in T . As usual we identify
aP with a subspace of a.
   As before we denote by XM the quotient of X∗ (T ) by the coroot lattice for M .
The Frobenius automorphism σ acts on XM , and we denote by YM the coinvariants
of σ on XM . Thus YM is the quotient of XM by the image of the homomorphism
1 − σ : XM → XM . We introduce a partial order on YM as follows: for y1 , y2 ∈ YM
               P
we say that y2 4 y1 if y1 −y2 is a non-negative integral linear combination of images
in YM of coroots α∨ corresponding to simple roots α of T in N .
                                                    +
   We identify YM ⊗Z R with aP , and we write YM      for the subset of YM consisting
of those elements whose image in aP lies in the cone
(4.1)              a+
                    P := {x ∈ aP : hα, xi > 0 ∀ root α of AP in N }.

  As in [Kot85]) the homomorphism wM : M (L) → XM induces a map
(4.2)                             κM : B(M ) → YM .
Now we can generalize Theorem 1.1 to this more general context, with the affine
Deligne-Lusztig sets XµG (b) still defined by (1.1).
Theorem 4.1. Let µ ∈ X∗ (T ) be a dominant coweight, and let b be a basic element
                             +
in M (L) such that κM (b) ∈ YM .
                                                      P
    (1) [RR96] If XµG (b) is non-empty, then κM (b) 4 µ. Here we are regarding µ
        as an element of YM .
    (2) Suppose that κM (b) = µ (with µ again regarded as an element of YM ).
        Then the natural injection XµM (b) ֒→ XµG (b) is a bijection.
Proof. The proof of part (1) is the same as the proof in the split case. The proof of
part (2) is the same as in the split case, except for one new complication, which we
will now explain. Suppose that g ∈ G(L) represents an element of XµG (b), so that
(4.3)                          g −1 bσ(g) ∈ KL µ(̟)KL ,
where we have written KL for G(oL ). As before we use the Iwasawa decomposition
to write g as mnk for m ∈ M (L), n ∈ N (L) and k ∈ KL . It follows from (4.3) that

(4.4)                            n1 m1 ∈ KL µ(̟)KL ,
where m1 := m bσ(m) ∈ M (L) and n1 := n−1 m1 σ(n)m−1
                −1
                                                         1 ∈ N (L). We need to
prove that g ∈ M (L) · KL (under the hypothesis that κM (b) = µ). Denote by ν
the image of rB (n1 m1 ) in XM . As in the proof of Theorem 1.1, the elements ν,
wM (b) of XM have the same image in YM , and by hypothesis the image of wM (b)
in YM is µ. We would like to apply Lemma 2.2 to the element n1 m1 , but for this
we would need to know that ν and µ are equal in XM , while all we know at the
moment is that they are equal in the quotient YM of XM . However, by (4.4) and
                            P
(2.6) we also know that ν ≤ µ. Therefore Lemma 4.2 shows that ν = µ in XM , as
desired. Thus we may apply Lemma 2.2 to the element n1 m1 in order to see that
n1 m1 ∈ KL · M (L). The rest of the proof is exactly the same as in the split case.
Of course we need to appeal to Lemma 3.2, but its statement generalizes without
change to the general unramified case, and its proof stays the same too, though one
should note that the subgroups Ni used in the proof need to be chosen so as to be
defined over o.                                                                  
  Next we prove the lemma we just used.
                                              P
Lemma 4.2. Let x ∈ XM . Suppose that x ≥ 0 and suppose further that the image
of x in YM is 0. Then x = 0.
             G
Proof. Let XM   denote the kernel of the canonical surjection XM → XG , so that
we get a short exact sequence
                                    G
(4.5)                          0 → XM → XM → XG → 0.
Taking coinvariants for σ, we get an exact sequence
                                  G
(4.6)                            YM → YM → YG → 0,
         G                                       G
where YM   denotes the coinvariants of σ on XM     .
              G
   Clearly XM   is a free abelian group on the set S of coroots α∨ for simple roots
                                                                                G
α of T that occur in N , and σ permutes these basis elements. Therefore YM         is a
                                                                     G
free abelian group on the set S̄ of orbits of σ on S. In particular YM is torsion-free,
                                G
which implies that the map YM     → YM is injective.
                                       P
                                                                                   G
   Now consider x ∈ XM such that x ≥ 0. In particular x lies in the subgroup XM      .
                                                                               G
Consider the image y of x in YM . It is clear that y lies in the subgroup YM , and
that its coefficients in the basis S̄ are given by summing over the orbits of σ on S
the coefficients of x in the basis S; since these latter coefficients are non-negative
                           P
by our hypothesis that x ≥ 0, we see that if y = 0, then x = 0 as well.              
4.2. Non-emptiness of affine Deligne-Lusztig subsets of G(L)/G(oL ). We
will now determine when the affine Deligne-Lusztig set XµG (b) (see (1.1)) is non-
empty. The split case is treated in Proposition 4.6 of [KR], and we follow closely
the method used there.
   As in [KR], for µ ∈ X∗ (T ) we put
(4.7)         Pµ := {ν ∈ X∗ (T ) : ν = µ in XG , and ν ∈ Conv(W µ)}
where Conv(W µ) denotes the convex hull of the W -orbit W µ of µ in X∗ (T ) ⊗ R,
W being the absolute Weyl group of T in G. With P = M N , YM as in 4.1 we
           ON THE HODGE-NEWTON DECOMPOSITION FOR SPLIT GROUPS                       9


let Pµ,M denote the subset of YM obtained as the image of Pµ under the canonical
surjection X∗ (T ) → YM .
Theorem 4.3. Let b ∈ M (L) be basic, and let µ ∈ X∗ (T ). Then XµG (b) is non-
empty if and only if κM (b) lies in Pµ,M .
   Since every σ-conjugacy class in G(L) contains an element that is basic in some
standard Levi subgroup M (see [Kot85]), this theorem gives a complete answer to
the question of when XµG (b) is non-empty. The theorem follows immediately from
the following three lemmas.
Lemma 4.4. Let b ∈ G(L) be basic. Then the σ-conjugacy class of b meets
KL µ(̟)KL if and only if κG (b) is equal to the image of µ in YM .
Proof. (=⇒) Obvious, since the homomorphism wG is trivial on KL .
   (⇐=) We write N (T ) for the normalizer of T in G. Then we have an exact
sequence
(4.8)                   1 → T (oL ) → N (T )(L) → W̃ → 1,
where W̃ := W ⋉ X∗ (T ) is the extended affine Weyl group for G over L. Using this
exact sequence, one sees without difficulty that the map N (T )(L) → W̃ induces a
bijection from B(N (T )) to the set of σ-conjugacy classes in the affine Weyl group
W̃ .
   For w ∈ W choose ẇ ∈ N (T )(oL ) such that ẇ 7→ w. Associated (see [Kot85])
to the element b′ := µ(̟)ẇ of N (T )(L) is a homomorphism ν : D → N (T ), where
D is the diagonalizable group with character group Q. It is easy to calculate ν.
Indeed, choose a positive integer r such that (wσ)r = σ r . We use w to twist the
action of σ on T , obtaining a new unramified torus Tw which becomes equal to T
over the fixed field Fr of σ r in L, but for which the action of σ is now given by wσ
rather than σ. Thus X∗ (Tw ) coincides with X∗ (T ) as an abelian group, but σ acts
by wσ rather than σ. From this point of view, the homomorphism ν : D → N (T )
may be regarded as an element of Hom(D, Tw ), or in other words as an element in
X∗ (T ) ⊗ Q fixed by wσ, the explicit formula for ν being given by
                                X
                                r
(4.9)                     r−1         (wσ)i (µ) ∈ X∗ (T ) ⊗ Q.
                                i=1

    The remarks above are valid for any w ∈ W . The well-known fact that semisim-
ple groups over finite fields have anisotropic maximal tori translates into the fact
that there exists w ∈ W for which the torus Tw is anisotropic modulo the center
of G; for the rest of this proof we work with such an element w. In this case ν is
forced to be central in G, and therefore the element b′ = µ(̟)ẇ is basic in G(L).
It is obvious from the form of b′ that κG (b′ ) = µ. By hypothesis b is basic and
κG (b) = µ. Therefore [Kot85] b is σ-conjugate in G(L) to b′ . From the form of b′ it
is obvious that b′ lies in the KL -double coset of µ(̟). This concludes the proof. 
  As in [KR] for µ ∈ X∗ (T ) we denote by M (µ) the image of KL µ(̟)KL ∩ P (L)
under the canonical surjection P (L) → M (L); obviously M (µ) is a union of M (oL )-
double cosets.
Lemma 4.5. Let b ∈ M (L) and let µ ∈ X∗ (T ). Then the following three conditions
are equivalent:
10
ROBERT E. KOTTWITZ DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 5734 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, CHICAGO, I


    (1) The σ-conjugacy class of b in G(L) meets KL µ(̟)KL .
    (2) The σ-conjugacy class of b in P (L) meets KL µ(̟)KL ∩ P (L).
    (3) The σ-conjugacy class of b in M (L) meets M (µ).
Proof. The equivalence of the first two conditions is clear from the Iwasawa decom-
position G(L) = KL P (L). The equivalence of the second two conditions follows
from the fact [Kot97, 3.6] that B(P ) → B(M ) is a bijection.                    

Lemma 4.6. The set wM (M (µ)) is equal to the image of Pµ under the canonical
surjection X∗ (T ) → XM .
Proof. This is Lemma 4.5 of [KR], which can be applied since G splits over L. Note
that the assumption, made at the beginning of §4 of [KR], that the derived group
of G be simply connected was made merely for convenience; in particular it was
not used in the proof of Lemma 4.5.                                             

4.3. Remarks concerning the converse to Mazur’s inequality. Let b, µ be as
in Theorem 4.1. Mazur’s inequality (in other words the first part of that theorem)
                                                P
says that if XµG (b) is non-empty, then κM (b) 4 µ, where µ is being regarded an
element of YM . Thus the converse to Mazur’s inequality is the statement, only
                                                    P
known to be true in certain cases, that if κM (b) 4 µ, then XµG (b) is non-empty.
Since Theorem 4.3 does tell us exactly when XµG (b) is non-empty, proving the
                                                                   P
converse to Mazur’s inequality is the same as proving that κM (b) 4 µ is equivalent
to κM (b) ∈ Pµ,M . Thus, in order to prove the converse to Mazur’s inequality in
general, it would be enough to answer the following question about root systems
affirmatively.
                                                                  +
Question 4.7. Let µ ∈ X∗ (T ) be a dominant coweight and let ν ∈ YM . Are the
following two conditions equivalent?
          P
    (1) ν 4 µ
    (2) ν ∈ Pµ,M
   It is immediate that the second condition implies the first. The challenge is to
prove that the first condition implies the second; this was done for GLn and GSp2n
in [KR] and for all split classical groups in [Lei02]; non-split groups have not been
examined yet.

4.4. Comparison with [RR96, 4.2]. Condition (1) in Question 4.7 looks superfi-
cially different from the one used in [RR96] (and also used to define the set B(G, µ)
in [Kot97]), but in fact it is equivalent, as we now check (see Proposition 4.10
below).
   This equivalent condition involves some additional notation. We write XR for
the real vector space X∗ (T ) ⊗ R. We identify a with the subspace of σ-fixed vectors
in XR , and we view a as a direct summand of XR , the projection map XR → a,
denoted x 7→ x♭ , being given by averaging over orbits of σ. We have already
identified aP with a subspace of a. In fact we view aP as a direct summand of a,
the projection map prM : a → aP being given by averaging over the relative Weyl
group WM(F ) of T in M . As usual we identify WM(F ) with the fixed points of σ in
the absolute Weyl group WM of T in M .

                         B
   The partial order ≤ on X∗ (T ) extends as usual to a partial order on XR , which
we will denote simply by ≤; thus for x, y ∈ XR the inequality x ≤ y means that
y − x is a non-negative real linear combination of simple coroots.
   Recall that we have already identified YM ⊗ R with aP . For ν ∈ YM we denote
by ν̄ the image of ν in aP (which lets us view ν̄ as an element in XR , as we will do
in the next lemma).
                                           P
Lemma 4.8. Let ν ∈ YM . Then ν < 0 if and only if ν̄ ≥ 0 and the image of ν in
YG is 0.
Proof. Exercise.                                                                                
Lemma 4.9. Let x be a dominant element of XR , and let y ∈ aP . Then y ≤ x♭ if
and only if y ≤ prM (x♭ ).
Proof. (=⇒) Apply prM to the inequality y ≤ x♭ , using that prM preserves ≤.
  (⇐=) This follows from the fact that prM (x♭ ) ≤ x♭ , a consequence of the in-
equalities wx♭ ≤ x♭ for w ∈ WM(F ) , which hold since x♭ is dominant.         
Proposition 4.10. Let µ ∈ X∗ (T ) be a dominant coweight and let ν ∈ YM . Then
the following two conditions are equivalent:
            P
    (1) ν 4 µ.
    (2) µ, ν have the same image in YG , and ν̄ ≤ µ♭ .
Proof. This follows from Lemmas 4.8 and 4.9.                                                    
