                                                        Abstract. Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with a finite center,
                                                        with a maximal compact subgroup K. There are two general methods to con-
                                                        struct representations of G, namely, ordinary parabolic induction and cohomo-
                                                        logical parabolic induction. We define Eisenstein integrals relative to cohomo-
                                                        logical inductions which generalize Flensted-Jensen’s fundamental functions for
                                                        discrete series. They are analogous to Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein integrals
                                                        related to ordinary inductions. We introduce the notion of Li positivity of a K
                                                        type in a representation of G which is extremely useful in the study of branching
                                                        laws. As an application of our integral, we show that the minimal K types of
                                                        many interesting representations are Li positive. These include all irreducible
                                                        unitary representations with nonzero cohomology.

                                             1.1. Complexifications of groups. Whenever H is a Lie group, we denote by
                                             HC the universal complexification of H; uH : H → HC the canonical homomor-
                                             phism; ¯ : HC → HC the anti-holomorphic automorphism on HC which is identity
                                             on uH (H). Recall that the universal complexification map uH is defined by the
                                             following property: If H ′ is a complex Lie group and φ : H → H ′ is a Lie group
                                             homomorphism, then there is a unique holomorphic homomorphism φ′ : HC → H ′
                                             such that φ′ ◦ uH = φ [6]. Notice that although universal complexifications are
                                             only defined for connected Lie groups in [6], the definitions and the results can

                                                   This paper is a part of the author’s doctoral dissertation in HKUST, supervised by Jian-Shu
                                             Li.

be easily generalized to non-connected Lie groups [13]. The followings are well
known:

    (1) The universal complexification of a connected Lie group is connected.
    (2) If H is a real reductive group in Harish-Chandra’s class, the uH has a finite
         kernel and the differential of uH is a comlexification of the Lie algebra of
         H.
    (3) If H is compact, then uH is injective.


1.2. Conventions. If V is a finite dimensional complex vector space and X is a
real analytic manifold, we denote by C∞ (X; V ) the space of all smooth functions
on X with values in V , and Cω (X; V ) for real analytic functions. When H is a Lie
group, c is a complex subspace of a complex Lie algebra, and H acts on c by certain
adjoint action, we denote by δc the non-unitary character on H defined by the
determinant of the action on c. For any finite dimension continuous representation
of a Lie group, say, τ of H, we use the same symbol τ to indicate its differential
as well as its holomorphic extension to HC . Whenever W is a set, we write 1W for
the identity map on W , or just 1 when no confusion is possible. If H is a compact
Lie group, α an H type, i.e., an equivalent class of irreducible finite dimensional
continuous representations of H, and M a H module, we write M(α) for the α-
isotypic component of M. Finally, we always use the normalized Haar measure
on a compact group for integration.


1.3. Notations. The following notations will be fixed throughout this paper un-
less otherwise mentioned. Let G be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra g0 .
Let g be the complexfication of g0 . We assume g0 is reductive and the connected
Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra [g0 , g0 ] has a finite center. Consequently, this
subgroup is closed in G. Let θ be a Cartan involution on G and let K be the
corresponding maximal compact subgroup of G. θ induces an automorphism on
                               EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                                  3

g which we still denote by θ. Let

                          g0 = k0 + p0     and         g=k+p

be the usual decompositions corresponding to θ. Denote by

                                 θ̄ = θ ◦ ¯ = ¯ ◦ θ

a conjugate linear automorphism of g. Notice that the above ” ¯ ” means the
complex conjugation of g with respect to the real form g0 . θ induces a holomorphic
automorphism on GC . We still call it θ. Still denote by

                                 θ̄ = θ ◦ ¯ = ¯ ◦ θ

the anti-holomorphic automorphism of GC . Let U be the subgroup of GC fixed
by θ̄. Notice that U is connected; and U is a maximal compact subgroup of GC
when G has a compact center.
  Let q be a parabolic subalgebra of g. We assume q is real or θ stable. These
are the two cases which are extremely interested in representation theory. Here q
is real means q̄ = q; q is θ stable means θ(q) = q and q ∩ q̄ is a Levi factor of q.
In both cases we define
                               G′ = NG (q) ∩ NG (θ̄(q)).

Here NG (q) means the normalizer of q in G, etc. Then G′ is a θ stable real
reductive group in Harish-Chandra’s class. Let g′0 be the Lie algebra of G′ and g′
be the complexification of g′0 . Then g′ is a Levi factor of q. Let n be the nilpotent
radical of q ∩ [g, g]. Then
                                     q = g′ ⊕ n.

Denote by N the connected complex subgroup of GC with Lie algebra n. Denote
by K ′ = K ∩ G′ . We note that G′ is also connected in the case of θ stable q. We
define two maps
                                   θ, θ̄ : G′C → G′C
4                                   SUN BINYONG

and a subgroup U ′ ⊂ G′C analogously.




1.4. Eisenstein integrals. When q is real, we can construct representations of G
from representations of G′ via ordinary parabolic inductions. When q is θ stable,
we can construct representations of G from representations of G′ via cohomological
parabolic inductions by using Zuckerman’s functors. Harish-Chandra was able to
define his Eisenstein integral which can be used to express the matrix coefficient
of an ordinary parabolic induced representation. Harish-Chandra has studied
Eisenstein integral extensively [3], [4]. We will not talk it in detail in this paper.
In stead, we will concentrate on the other case, namely, when q is θ stable. Our
integral is a generalization of Flensted-Jensen’s fundamental functions for discrete
series. Harish-Chandra’s is a generalization of elementary spherical functions for
spherical principle series. Now we are going to have a detailed description of our
integral, comparing to Harish-Chandra’s.
    Fix a finite dimensional continuous representation τ of K × K on V. Let




(1)         V′ = { v ∈ V | τ (X, Y )v = 0 for all X ∈ n ∩ k, Y ∈ n̄ ∩ k }.




Define a representation τ ′ of K ′ × K ′ on V′ by




(2)                      τ ′ (k, l)v = δn̄∩p(k)δn∩p(l)τ (k, l)v.




We call τ ′ the representation q-associated to τ . Notice that when q is real, we
have V′ = V and τ ′ = τ .

  We define three spaces of τ -spherical functions by

      C∞ (G; τ )        = { f ∈ C∞ (G; V) |

                             f (k1xk2−1 ) = τ (k1 , k2 )f (x) for all k1 , k2 ∈ K, x ∈ G };

      C∞ (GC /U; τ ) = { f ∈ C∞ (GC /U; V) |

                             f (kx) = τ (k, k̄)f (x) for all k ∈ KC , x ∈ GC /U };

      C∞ (G/K; τ )      = { f ∈ C∞ (G/K; V) |

                             f (kx) = τ (k, k)f (x) for all k ∈ K, x ∈ G/K }.

We will prove that these three spaces can be canonically identified with each other.
We similarly define C∞ (G′ ; τ ′ ), C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ) and C∞ (G′ /K ′ ; τ ′ ).
  When q is real, Langlands decomposition enables us to define a real analytic
map

                            Hq :     G     →         G′ ×K ′ K,
                                    ngk 7→        the class of (g, k)

for all n ∈ exp(n ∩ g0 ), g ∈ G′ , k ∈ K, where G′ ×K ′ K means the quotient
of G′ × K by K ′ under the action indicated by the notation. So G′ ×K ′ K is
essentially the closed subset G′ K of G. When q is a θ stable parabolic, denote
by jC : G′C → GC the complexification of the embedding j : G′ → G. Again by
Langlands decomposition we define a real analytic map

                                Hq :      GC /U     → G′C /U ′ ,
                                         njC (g)U 7→       gU ′

for all n ∈ N and g ∈ G′C .
  We also need normalization factors. When q is real, define


                       δqR (g, k) = |δn(g)|1/2,       (g, k) ∈ G′ ×K ′ K.
6                                                 SUN BINYONG

When q is a θ stable parabolic, define

                            δqR (xU ′ ) = δn(xθ̄(x−1 )),          xU ′ ∈ G′C /U ′ .

In both cases, δqR has positive values everywhere.
    When q is real, φ ∈ C∞ (G′ ; τ ′ ), extend φ to G′ ×K ′ K by

                                        φ(g, k) = τ (1, k −1 )φ(g).

Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein integral can be formulated as follows:
                         Z
            Eq(φ : x) =      τ (k −1 , 1)(δqR φ)(Hq(kx)) dk x ∈ G.
                                      K

It turns out easily that Eq(φ) ∈ C∞ (G; τ ). When q is a θ stable parabolic,
φ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ), we define our integral by
                             Z
           Eq(φ : x) =          τ (k −1 , k −1 )(δqR φ)(Hq(kx)) dk               x ∈ GC /U.
                                 K

We still have Eq(φ) ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ ) in our case, but the proof is not as easy as in
Harish-Chandra’s case. It is in fact one of our main results.

Theorem 1.1. When q is a θ stable parabolic, Eq(φ) ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ ) for all
φ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ).

    We will prove the above theorem later.
    Denote by τ |K the representation of K on V given by

                                     τ |K (k) = τ (k, k),          k ∈ K.

If k ∈ K, denote by

                                Tk (x) = kxk −1 ,         if x ∈ G,       and
                                Tk (xU) = kxU,            if xU ∈ GC /U.
    Then it’s clear that Harish-Chandra’s integral and ours can be formulated in
the same appearance:
                                        Z
                     Eq(φ : x) =                τ |K (k −1 )((δqR φ) ◦ Hq ◦ Tk )(x) dk.
                                            K

In both cases, the normalization δqR is used to make the integral compatible with
the usual normalization of parabolic inductions. Matrix coefficients of parabolic
induced representations can be expressed as Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein inte-
grals. We will prove that the matrix coefficients of the bottom layers of coho-
mologically induced representations can be expressed as our Eisenstein integral.
Combining these two, we can find an integral representation of the matrix coeffi-
cient of every minimal K type in an arbitrary irreducible (g, K) module.

  The purpose of this section is to understand the correspondence between C∞ (G; τ )
and C∞ (GC /U; τ ) mentioned in last section. The ideas come from [2].

2.1. Complexification squares. Denote by SA a commutative diagram
                                  A1 −−−→    A2
                                            
                                            
                                  y          y
                                  A3 −−−→ A4 .
We call SA a complexification square if the followings are satisfied:

   (1) A1 , A2 , A3 are nonempty connected real analytic manifolds, A4 is a con-
       nected complex manifold;
   (2) All the arrows in SA are real analytic maps;
   (3) The differential of the map A2 → A4 is a complexification of real vector
       space everywhere;
   (4) The same for the map A3 → A4 .

The last two conditions essential say that locally A2 and A3 are totally real sub-
manifolds of A4 .
  We say SA is a complexification square of groups if

   (1) A1 , A2 , A3 are connected Lie groups; A4 is a connected complex Lie group.
8                                  SUN BINYONG

     (2) All the arrows in SA are Lie group homomorphisms;
     (3) The differential of the homomorphism A2 → A4 is a complexification of
        the Lie algebra of A2 ;
     (4) The same for the map A3 → A4 .

Therefore a complexification square of groups is a complexification square.
    Let SA be a complexification square (complexification square of groups) as
before. Let SB

                                   B3 −−−→ B4 .


be another complexification square (complexification square of groups ). We define
the product SA × SB to be the commutative diagram


                             A1 × B1 −−−→ A2 × B2
                                            

                             A3 × B3 −−−→ A4 × B4 ,


where the arrows are the corresponding products. Then SA ×SB is still a complex-
ification square (complexification square of groups). We define an homomorphism
from SA to SB to be four maps



                           fi : Ai → Bi     i = 1, 2, 3, 4,



such that

     (1) f1 , f2 , f3 are real analytic maps (Lie group homomorphisms),
     (2) f4 is a complex analytic map (Complex analytic group homomorphism),

  Assume SA is a complexification square of groups, SB is a complexification
square, and
                        f = (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) : SA × SB → SB

is a homomorphism of complexification squares, we say f is an analytic action of
SA on SB if all fi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are group actions. We define the concept of a
complexification square of Lie algebras in the obvious way. If SA is a complexifi-
cation square of groups, take the Lie algebra of each component of SA , we get a
complexification square of Lie algebras. We call it the Lie algebra of SA .

Fix a base point a1 ∈ A1 . Denote by

                     a2 = u2 (a1 ),    a3 = u3 (a1 ),   a4 = v2 (a2 ).

Definition 2.1. Let φ ∈ Cω (A2 ; V ), and ψ ∈ Cω (A3 ; V ). φ and ψ are said to
correspond to each other under SA (or φ ≡SA ψ in notation) if the following
condition is satisfied:
     There are open neighborhoods Ui of ai in Ai , i = 2, 3, 4 and a holomorphic map
f from U4 to V such that

      (1) v2 (U2 ) ⊂ U4 , v3 (U3 ) ⊂ U4 , and
      (2) f ◦ (v2 |U2 ) = φ|U2 , f ◦ (v3 |U3 ) = ψ|U3 .

     Notice that any function in Cω (A2 ; V ) corresponds to at most one function in
Cω (A3 ; V ), and vice versa.

Lemma 2.2. The above definition is independent of the choice of the base point
a1 ∈ A1 .

Proof. Let φ ∈ Cω (A2 ; V ), and ψ ∈ Cω (A3 ; V ). In this proof, we use

                                              φ ≡a1 ψ

to indicate that φ and ψ correspond to each other under the above definition.
Denote by

                                   A0 = { b ∈ A1 | φ ≡b ψ }.

We only need to show that A0 is either A1 or the empty set. It’s clear that A0 is
open in A1 . We should prove that A0 is closed. Let b1 be a point in the closure
of A0 in A1 . Denote by

                          b2 = u2 (b1 ),    b3 = u3 (b1 ),   b4 = v2 (b2 ).

Choose open connected neighborhoods Wi of bi in Ai , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, so that

                          u2 (W1 ) ⊂ W2 ,         u3(W1 ) ⊂ W3 ,      and
                          v2 (W2 ) ⊂ W4 ,        v3 (W3 ) ⊂ W4 .

We choose them small enough, then there are holomorphic functions g and h on
W4 satisfies:
                               g ◦ (v2 |W2 ) = φ|W2 ,        and
                               h ◦ (v3 |W3 ) = ψ|W3 .
Since b1 is in the closure of A0 , there is a point a1 ∈ W1 ∩ A0 . Denote by

                      a2 = u2 (a1 ),    a3 = u3 (a1 ),     a4 = v2 (a2 ).

By definition, there are open connected neighborhoods Ui of ai in Wi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4,
so that there is a holomorphic function f on U4 satisfies:

   (1) v2 (U2 ) ⊂ U4 , v3 (U3 ) ⊂ U4 , and
   (2) f ◦ (v2 |U2 ) = φ|U2 , f ◦ (v3 |U3 ) = ψ|U3 .

Then we have

                               f ◦ (v2 |U2 ) = g|U4 ◦ (v2 |U2 ).

Therefore

                                          f = g|U4 .

Similarly

                                          f = h|U4 .

Now we conclude that g = h and therefore b1 ∈ A0 . This proves that A0 is closed.
                                                                                    
  The following lemma will be used later, we omit its easy proof.

Lemma 2.3. Assume both SA and SB are complexification squares. Let

                              f = (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) : SA → SB

be a homomorphism from SA to SB . Assume that both f2 and f3 are submersions.
Let φ ∈ Cω (B2 ; V ) and ψ ∈ Cω (B3 ; V ). Then

                     φ ≡SB ψ      if and only if       φ ◦ f2 ≡SA ψ ◦ f3 .

2.3. Differential operators. We can generalize the above considerations to dif-
ferential operators. Let A be a real analytic manifold, B a complex manifold,
and

                                            u:A→B

a real analytic map whose differential is a complexification of real vector space
everywhere. Let D be a holomorphic differential operator on B. Then there is a
unique analytic differential operator D ′ on A satisfies the following:
     For every open subset UA of A, UB of B, and every holomorphic function f on
UB , if u(UA ) ⊂ UB , then


                                 D ′ (f ◦ u|UA ) = D(f ) ◦ u|UA .


Denote by u∗ (D) the differential operator D ′ .
     Assume SA

                                                       y
                                          A3 −−−→ A4 .
                                                 v3

is a complexification square as before. Fix a base point a1 ∈ A1 . Recall that


                         a2 = u2 (a1 ),    a3 = u3 (a1 ),       a4 = v2 (a2 ).


Definition 2.4. Let D2 be an analytic differential operator on A2 , and D3 an
analytic differential operator on A3 . D2 and D3 are said to correspond to each
other under SA (or D2 ≡SA D3 in notation) if the following condition is satisfied:
     There are open neighborhoods Ui of ai in Ai , i = 2, 3, 4 and a holomorphic
differential operator D on U4 such that

      (1) v2 (U2 ) ⊂ U4 , v3 (U3 ) ⊂ U4 , and
      (2) (v2 |U2 )∗ (D) = D2 |U2 , (v3 |U3 )∗ (D) = D3 |U3 .

  Again this definition is independent of the choice of the base point a1 ∈ A1 . An
analytic differential operator on A2 correspond to at most one analytic differential
operator on A3 , and vice versa.
  Let V be a finite dimensional complex vector space. The following lemma is
obvious.


Lemma 2.5. Let φ ∈ Cω (A2 ; V ), ψ ∈ Cω (A3 ; V ). Let D2 be an analytic differen-
tial operator on A2 , and D3 an analytic differential operator on A3 . If

                          φ ≡SA ψ,       and D2 ≡SA D3 ,

then

                                   D2 (φ) ≡SA D3 (ψ).


2.4. Some complexification squares. We have a commutative diagram which
we denote by S:
                                         K    p
                                   G/K −−−→          G
                                                    
                                      
                                   vG y
                                                     u
                                                     y G
                                              pU
                                   GC /U −−−→ GC ,
where vG is the map induced by uG ; pK is defined by

                           pK (xK) = xθ(x−1 ),        x ∈ G;

pU is defined by

                          pU (xU) = xθ̄(x−1 ),       x ∈ GC .

S is clearly a complexification square. Denote by SG the following complexification
square of groups:
                                       1×θ

We have a natural analytic action T of SG on S. The action of G × G on G is
given by

                             Tg,l x = gxl−1     g, l, x ∈ G.

The action of GC × GC on GC is defined similarly. The other two actions are
defined by the natural left translations.
     Denote by Sg the Lie algebra of SG , it is the following complexification square
of Lie algebras:
                                       1×θ
                                   g0 −−−→ g0 × g0

                                       1×θ̄
                                   g −−−→ g × g.
Let V be a finite dimensional complex vector space as before. The action T of SG
on S induces a smooth representation T of G × G on C∞ (G; V ) by

               (Tg,h φ)(x) = φ(Tg−1 ,h−1 (x)) = φ(g −1xh),
                                              g, h, x ∈ G, φ ∈ C∞ (G; V )

and also a smooth representation T of GC on C∞ (GC /U; V ) by

           (Tg ψ)(x) = ψ(Tg−1 (x)) = ψ(g −1x),
                                    g ∈ GC , x ∈ GC /U, ψ ∈ C∞ (GC /U; V ).

Take differential of these two representations, and use the complexifications in the
diagram Sg, we have an action T of U(g) ⊗ U(g) on C∞ (G; V ) and C∞ (GC /U; V ).
Notice that here we use the canonical identification of U(g) ⊗ U(g) with U(g × g).
This T is in fact the action of analytic differential operators.


Lemma 2.6. Let X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g) ⊗ U(g). Let DG be the differential operator on G
determined by TX⊗Y . Let DGC /U be the differential operator on GC /U determined
by TX⊗Y . Then

                                    DG ≡S DGC /U .

Proof. Let DC be the holomorphic differential operator on GC determined by X⊗Y
and the holomorphic action T of GC × GC on GC . Then


                   (uG )∗ (DC ) = DG ,   and (pU )∗ (DC ) = DGC /U .


                                                                              


2.5. Flensted-Jensen’s duality for groups. Let τ be a finite dimensional con-
tinuous representation of K × K on V as before. Cω (G; τ ), Cω (GC /U; τ ) and
Cω (G/K; τ ), etc, are defined in an obvious way.
  The following is the main result of this section.


Proposition 2.7.        (1) The pull back of pK and vG induces canonical isomor-
         phisms of vector spaces:


                     C∞ (G; τ ) = C∞ (G/K; τ ) = C∞ (GC /U; τ ).


   (2)

                      Cω (G; τ ) = Cω (G/K; τ ) = Cω (GC /U; τ )


         under the above identifications.
   (3) If φ ∈ Cω (G; τ ) and ψ ∈ Cω (GC /U; τ ), then


                     φ ≡S ψ     if and only if   φ ◦ pK = ψ ◦ vG .


  Notice that

                              Cω (G; τ ) = Cω (GC /U; τ )


is also an identification of U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K modules.

Here the outer side square is the product SK × SG/K , and the inner square is S.
Therefore by putting all the four π’s together, we have a homomorphism

                        π = (π1 , π2 , π3 , π4 ) : SK × SG/K → S.

  Denote by S0 the following complexification square of groups

                                      K −−−→ KC .
If a ∈ K, we define the actions of a on K × G/K, (K × K) × G/K, and KC × G/K
by
                  (k, xK)          7→ (ka−1 , axK),
                  (k1 , k2 , xK) 7→ (k1 a−1 , k2 a−1 , axK), and
                  (k, xK)          7→ (ka−1 , axK),

respectively. If a ∈ KC , we define the actions of a on (KC × KC ) × GC /KC by

                     (k1 , k2 , xKC ) 7→ (k1 a−1 , k2a−1 , axK).

It’s again routine to check that we have an analytic action of S0 on SK × SG/K
by the above actions.
  The following lemma says that S is the quotient of SK × SG/K by S0 , except
the complex component. It is implicit in [2]. We omit its proof.

Lemma 2.8. The maps π1 , π2 , and π3 are surjective real analytic submersions.
Each fibre of theses maps is a K obit of the actions defined above.

2.7. Proof of Proposition 2.7. Denote by

              C∞ ((K × K) × G/K; τ )

           = { φ ∈ C∞ ((K × K) × G/K; V) | φ(k1 , k2 , x) = τ (k1 , k2 )φ(1, 1, x),

                φ(k1 a−1 , k2 a−1 , ax) = φ(k1 , k2, x),   k1 , k2 , a ∈ K, x ∈ G/K }.

By using the pull back of π2 we have an identification

                           C∞ (G; τ ) = C∞ ((K × K) × G/K; τ ).

We identify G/K with the subset {1} × {1} × G/K of (K × K) × G/K. Every
function in C∞ ((K × K) × G/K; τ ) is determined by its restriction to G/K. It’s
easy to see that by using the restriction we have an identification

                        C∞ ((K × K) × G/K; τ ) = C∞ (G/K; τ ).

     Similarly denote by

                  C∞ (KC × G/K; τ )

               = { φ ∈ C∞ (KC × G/K; V) | φ(k, x) = τ (k, k̄)φ(1, x),

                    φ(ka−1 , ax) = φ(k, x),          k ∈ KC , a ∈ K, x ∈ G/K }.

Then by using the pull back of π3 and a restriction map we have canonical iden-
tifications

                 C∞ (GC /U; τ ) = C∞ (KC × G/K; τ ) = C∞ (G/K; τ ).

Keep these identifications in mind, we get the first assertion of Proposition 2.7.
It’s clear that under these identifications, real analytic functions correspond to
real analytic functions. This proves the second assertion.

  For the third assertion of Proposition 2.7. Let φ ∈ Cω (G; V) and ψ ∈ Cω (GC /U; V).
If φ ≡S ψ, then it’s clear that


                                   φ ◦ pK = ψ ◦ vG .


Now assume


                               φ ◦ pK = ψ ◦ vG = f0 .


Choose a connected open neighborhood C0 of 1K in G/K and a connected open
neighborhood C of 1KC in GC /KC so that f0 |C0 extends to a holomorphic function
f on C. Extend f to KC × KC × C by


                            f (k1, k2 , x) = τ (k1 , k2 )f (x).


By this extended f , we easily get that φ ◦ π2 and ψ ◦ π3 correspond to each other
under SK ×SG/K . By Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 2.8 , we know φ ≡S ψ. This finishes
the proof of the third assertion of Proposition 2.7.




                         3. A proof of Theorem 1.1

3.1. An integral formula. In this subsection, we establish an integral formula
which is crucial for the proof of Theorem 1.1. The formula is a stronger version
of Corollary 11.40 of [12]. We only need to apply the formula to the complex
group KC . We formulate it in its full generality as it is interesting in itself. The
notations in this subsection are not used in other parts of this paper.
  Let G be a real reductive Lie group in Harish-Chandra’s class, θ a Cartan
involution on G. Let q0 be a parabolic subalgebra of g0 = Lie(G). We introduce
20                                     SUN BINYONG

the following notations:

     K is the maximal compact subgroup of G fixed by θ.
     g0 = k0 + p0 is the Cartan decomposition corresponds to θ
     Q is the normalizer of q0 in G.
     Q = LN is the Levi decomposition so that L is θ stable..
     q0 = l0 + n0 is the corresponding Levi decomposition at the Lie algebra level.
     l′0 = l0 ∩ p0 .
     δ : L → R× is the homomorphism defined by the absolute value of
          the determinant of the adjoint representation of L on n0 .

     By Langlands decomposition, the map

                              N × l′0 × K → G,
(3)
                                   (n, X, k) 7→ n exp(X)k

is a real analytic diffeomorphism. We define two maps κ : G → K, and I : G → L
by κ(nak) = k, I(nak) = a for all n ∈ N, a ∈ exp(l′0 ), k ∈ K. If a ∈ G, we define
a map κa : K → K by κa (k) = κ(ka).
     The purpose of this subsection is to prove

Proposition 3.1. If f is a continuous function on K, then
                   Z                 Z
                          a
                      f (κ (k)) dk =    f (k)δ(I(ka−1 )) dk.
                         K                  K


     We need some lemmas.

                             −1
Lemma 3.2. κa and κa              are inverse to each other. Hence κa is an analytic
diffeomorphism.

Proof. Let k ∈ K and ka = n1 s1 k1 , where n1 ∈ N, s1 ∈ exp(l′0 ), and k1 ∈ K.
Then we have

                          k1 a−1 = s−1 −1      −1 −1     −1
                                    1 n1 k = (s1 n1 s1 )s1 k.

Hence
                       −1             −1
                     κa κa (k) = κa (k1 ) = κ(k1 a−1 ) = k.
                             −1
Change a to a−1 , we get κa κa (k) = k.                                      
  If a ∈ G, we denote by Ta the right translation of a on Q\G. We give Q\G the
unique K invariant measure with total mass 1.

Lemma 3.3. If k ∈ K, then the Jacobian of Ta at Qk is

                              JTa (Qk) = δ(I(ka)).

  This should be known, we give a proof for the sake of completeness.

Proof. Let ka = nsκ(ka), where n ∈ N and s = I(ka). We have a commutative
diagram
                                    a      T
                              Q\G −−−→ Q\G

                                     ns    T
                               Q\G −−−→ Q\G.
Since Tk−1 and Tκ(ka)−1 preserve the measure,

                              JTa (Qk) = JTns (Q1).

The right hand side is the absolute value of the determinant of the tangent map
dTns |Q at the point Q. We have another commutative diagram
                                      Ad(ns)−1
                                  G   −−−−−→      G

                             Q\G      −−−→       Q\G.
Take the tangent map at the identity, we get
                                      Ad(ns)−1

     For any a ∈ G, let Ja be the Jacobian of κa .

Lemma 3.4. Ja is left K ∩ Q invariant.

Proof. For any k ∈ K, we use Lk to denote the left translation on K by k.

We omit the easy proof of this fact.                                                             

Lemma 3.5. Ja (k) = δ(I(ka)) for all k ∈ K.

3.2. The proof. We now return to use the notations in section 1.4. Assume q
is a θ stable parabolic. We apply the results obtained in the last subsection to the
group KC . Let k′0 be the Lie algebra of K ′ . Let Nc be the connected subgroup of
KC with Lie algebra n ∩ k. Now the parabolic subgroup is Nc KC′ . The map (3) in
this case is

Proof. Let ka = n′ a′ k ′ , where n′ ∈ Nc , a′ ∈ exp( −1k′0 ), k ′ ∈ K ′ . Then

                 κa (k)a−1 = k ′ a−1 = a′−1 n′−1 k = (a′−1 n′−1 a′ )a′−1 k.

Therefore I(κa (k)a−1 ) = a′−1 . As Hq is G′C equivariant and N invariant, we have

for all k ∈ KC′ .

     Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let a ∈ KC and x ∈ GC /U. Write k ′ = κa (k), then

Now use Proposition 3.1, we have

Write I ′ = (I(ka−1 ))−1 and k ′′ = (κa (k))−1 for simplicity. By Lemma 3.7, we
have

                     K

  Notice that k ′′ I ′ = ak −1 n for some n ∈ Nc , and Nc fix the values of φ under the
action τ |KC . Therefore Lemma 3.8 implies

Theorem 4.1. For all X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K and φ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ),

                          TX⊗Y Eq(φ) = Eq(Tξ′∨ (X)⊗ξ(Y ) φ).

4.2. Proof of Theorem 4.1. Notice that we also have

                                            ′
                      U(g)K ⊂ U(g′ )K ⊕ (n̄ U(g) ∩ U(g)n).

The projection to the first factor is just the algebra homomorphism

                                ξ˜∨ : U(g)K → U(g′ )K .

Lemma 4.2. Let X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K and f ∈ C∞ (GC /U; V). If f is N
invariant, then

                                TX⊗Y f = Tξ̃∨ (X)⊗ξ̃(Y ) f.

Proof. Let X = X ′ + X ′′ , Y = Y ′ + Y ′′ , where X ′ = ξ˜∨ (X), X ′′ ∈ U(g)n,
      ˜ ), Y ′′ ∈ U(g)n̄. Notice that under the complexification
Y ′ = ξ(Y

                               1 × θ̄ : g → g × g,
                                           v 7→ (v, θ̄(v)),

The Lie algebra of N has a complexification n × n̄. Therefore the N invariance of
f implies Tn×n̄f = 0, i.e., Tn⊗1+1⊗n̄f = 0 . So we have

                        TX⊗Y f = TX ′ ⊗Y ′ f = Tξ̃∨ (X)⊗ξ̃(Y ) f.

                                                                               

Lemma 4.3. Let X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K and φ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; V′). Then

be the algebra homomorphism so that ηq̄(X) = X + δn̄(X) for all X ∈ g′ . It’s
easy to see that ηq̄ = ηq∨ and hence

                                           ˜ ∨ = ηq̄ ◦ ξ˜∨ .
                               ξ ∨ = (ηq ◦ ξ)

     Define an algebra homomorphism

           η0 : U(g′ × g′ ) = U(g′ ) ⊗ U(g′ ) → U(g′ × g′ ) = U(g′ ) ⊗ U(g′ ),
                                    X ′ ⊗ Y ′ 7→ ηq̄(X ′ ) ⊗ ηq(Y ′ ).

We only need to show that

                                 TZ′ (δqR φ) = δqR Tη′0 (Z) (φ)

for all Z ∈ U(g′ × g′ ). As U(g′ × g′ ) is generated by g′ × g′ , it is sufficient to show
the above equality holds for Z ∈ g′ × g′ . Now assume Z = (X ′ , Y ′ ) ∈ g′ × g′ .
Then TZ′ is an action defined by a vector field on G′C /U ′ . Hence

                           TZ′ (δqR φ) = TZ′ (δqR )φ + δqR TZ′ (φ).

We easily find that
                            TZ′ (δqR ) = (δn̄(X ′ ) + δn(Y ′ ))δqR .

Therefore

                                TZ′ (δqR φ)

                             = TZ′ (δqR )φ + δqR TZ′ (φ)

                             = δqR ((δn̄(X ′ ) + δn(Y ′ ))φ + TZ′ φ)

                             = δqR Tη′0 (Z) (φ).

                                                                                       

Notice that

X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K implies

                             TX⊗Y (f ◦ Tk ) = TX⊗Y (f ) ◦ Tk .

Hence

Notice that the map

is G′C equivariant. Therefore

for all   X ′ ⊗ Y ′ ∈ U(g′ ) ⊗ U(g′ ), ψ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; V′).

                                              modules

5.1. Zuckerman’s functors. We call a vector space a weak (U(g)K , K) module
if it is a locally finite K module as well as a U(g)K module so that the K action and
the U(g)K action commute. Notice that every (g, K) module is a weak (U(g)K , K)
module. In this section, we study the weak (U(g)K , K) module structure of a
bottom layer of a cohomologically induced module. We recall some notations from
[12] for cohomological inductions and bottom layer maps.
     Γ0 is the Zuckerman functor from the category of (g, K ′ ) modules to the category
of (g, K) modules. It’s given by

               Γ0 (M) = sum of all finite dimensional k invariant subspaces

                        of M for which the action of k globalize to K .

This is a left exact covariant functor. Let Γi be its ith derived functor, i =
0, 1, 2, · · · . Γ0K is the Zuckerman functor from the category of (k, K ′ ) modules
to the category of (k, K) modules. ΓiK , i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , are its derived functors.

5.3. Bottom layers. Let σ be a finite dimensional continuous representation of
K on W . Let


(5)                       W ′ = { v ∈ W | σ(n ∩ k)v = 0 }.


Define a representation σ ′ of K ′ on W ′ by


(6)                  σ ′ (k)v = δn̄∩p(k)σ(k)v,     k ∈ K ′ , v ∈ W.


We call σ ′ the representation q-associated to σ. If σ is irreducible of type α, then
σ ′ is also irreducible. We call the equivalent class of σ ′ the K ′ type q-associated
to α.
     From now on in this section, we fix a K type α. We also fix an irreducible
representation σ0 of K of type α on a vector space Wα . Let σ0′ be the representation
of K ′ on Wα′ which is q-associated to σ0 , and α′ be the K ′ type q-associated to
α.
     Denote by S = dim(n ∩ k) as usual. The most interesting case of cohomological
induction is when i = S. Denote by M = RS (M ′ ) and L = HomK ′ (Wα′ , M ′ ). L
             ′
is a U(g′ )K module by the action on M ′ . We make L a U(g)K module by the
formula

                        Xv = ξ(X)v,          X ∈ U(g)K , v ∈ L.

L ⊗ Wα is a weak (U(g)K , K) module by the action of U(g)K on the first factor,
and the action of K on the second factor.

Definition 5.4. Let M ′ be a (g′ , K ′ ) module, M = RS (M ′ ). α is said to be in
the bottom layer of M if the map induced by BM ′ ,


                   BM ′ (α) : M(α) = RS◦ (M ′ )(α) → RSK (M ′ )(α)


is bijective and nonzero.


  We know that under a weak condition on M ′ , α is in the bottom layer of M if and
only if M ′ (α′) 6= 0. The condition holds when M ′ has an infinitesimal character
([12], Theorem 5.80, Corollary 5.72). I don’t know whether the following result is
new or not.


Proposition 5.5. With the notations as above. If α is in the bottom layer of M,
then M(α) is isomorphic to L ⊗ Wα as a weak (U(g)K , K) module.


Proof. We easily find that the following diagram commutes

                                M ′#           M ′ ⊗ ∧top n
                                                   
                                                   

                                M ′#          M ′ ⊗ ∧top n

for all X ∈ U(g′ ). This implies another commutative diagram

               HomK ′ (Wα′ ⊗ ∧top n, M ′# )            HomK ′ (Wα′ , M ′ )
                                                              
                                                              
                         Xy                              ηq (X)y

               HomK ′ (Wα′ ⊗ ∧top n, M ′# )            HomK ′ (Wα′ , M ′ )
                   ′
for all X ∈ U(g′ )K . Since


                       H0 (n ∩ k, Wα ) ⊗ ∧top (n ∩ k) ∼
                                                      = Wα′ ⊗ ∧top n


as K ′ modules, Theorem 4.155 of [12] gives an isomorphism


               HomK (Wα , RSK (M ′ )) ∼
                                      = HomK ′ (Wα′ ⊗ ∧top n, M ′# ).

                                                                 ′
The naturalness implies this is an isomorphism of U(g′ )K modules. Therefore
Proposition 5.3 and the above commutative diagram implies we have a commu-
tative diagram
                   HomK (Wα , RS (M ′ )) −−−→ L = HomK ′ (Wα′ , M ′ )
                                                      
                                                      
                         Xy                        ξ(X)y

                   HomK (Wα , RS (M ′ )) −−−→ L = HomK ′ (Wα′ , M ′ )
for all X ∈ U(g)K . The horizontal maps are bijective as α is in the bottom layer.
This finishes the proof.                                                           

                   6. Matrix coefficient of a bottom layer

6.1. The matrix coefficient of a given K type. Let W be a finite dimensional
weak (U(g)K , K) module. Denote by σ the actions of U(g)K and K on W . Define
AW (G) to be the space of all functions φ ∈ C∞ (G; EndC (W )) so that

       φ(k1xk2 ) = σ(k1 ) ◦ φ(x) ◦ σ(k2 ),      k1 , k2 ∈ K, x ∈ G, and
       TX⊗Y φ(x) = σ(X ∨ ) ◦ φ(x) ◦ σ(Y ),        x ∈ G, X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K .

Notice that every function in AW (G) is real analytic.
     If M is an admissible (g, K) module, denote by M c the contragredient (g, K)
module of M. If V is a finite dimensional continuous K module and α is a K
type, define V c and αc similarly. Let’s recall the basic fact of the existence and
uniqueness of the matrix coefficient map.

Proposition 6.1. ([1], Theorem 8.7) If M is an admissible (g, K) module, then
there is a unique (g × g, K × K) intertwining linear map

                               cM : M c ⊗ M → C∞ (G; C)

such that

                      cM (u ⊗ v)(1) = hu, vi,       u ⊗ v ∈ M c ⊗ M,

where 1 is the identity element of G.

  Now let M be an arbitrary finitely generated admissible (g, K) module, α a K
type, and W = M(α). Then W is a weak (U(g)K , K) module. W c = M c (αc ) is
the contragredient of the K module W . We use cM,α to denote the function on G
with values in EndC (W ) defined by


           hu, cM,α(x)(v)i = cM (u ⊗ v)(x),     u ∈ W c , v ∈ W, x ∈ G,


where cM is the matrix coefficient map in the above proposition. The function
cM,α can also be described as the following. Take a Hilbert representation


                               πG : G × MG → MG


whose underlying (g, K) module is M. Let


                                  sW : MG → W


be the continuous linear map so that its restriction to MG (β) is zero for all K
type β other than α, and its restriction to W is the identity map. Then we have


               cM,α (x) = sW ◦ πG (x) ◦ jW ∈ EndC (W ),      x ∈ G,


where jW is the inclusion of W into MG . By the above formula, it’s not difficult to
see that cM,α ∈ AW (G). It’s obvious that cM,α (1) is the identity map on W . The
following proposition says that these two conditions determines cM,α uniquely.


Proposition 6.2. Let W be a finite dimensional weak (U(g)K , K) module. If W
is primary as a K module, then the map φ 7→ φ(1) gives an injection from AW (G)
into EndU(g)K ,K (W ).


Proof. Let φ ∈ AW (G). It’s easy to see that φ(1) ∈ EndU(g)K ,K (W ). Now we
assume φ(1) = 0.
38                                       SUN BINYONG

     Assume W = L ⊗ W0 , where L is a U(g)K module and W0 is an irreducible K
module. Define a map

               Tr0 : EndC (W ) = EndC (L) ⊗ EndC (W0 ) → EndC (L),
                                                         x ⊗ y 7→ Tr(y)x.

Let φ̃ = Tr0 ◦φ be an EndC (L) valued real analytic function, and denote by σ0 the
action of U(g)K on L. Then we have
  
  
    φ̃(1) = 0;
  
  
  
  
     φ̃(kxk −1 ) = φ̃(x),        x ∈ G, k ∈ K;
  
  
  
  
  
   TX⊗Y φ̃(x) = σ0 (X ∨) ◦ φ̃(x) ◦ σ0 (Y ), x ∈ G, X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K .

     We essentially copy the following arguments from [2] to deduce that φ̃ = 0. Let
X ∈ U(g). Denote by
                                     Z
                              X̃ =           Adk X dk ∈ U(g)K .
                                         K

We have

         TX⊗1 φ̃(1) = Adk (TX⊗1 φ̃)(1) = TAdk (X)⊗1 (Adk φ̃)(1) = TAdk (X)⊗1 φ̃(1)

for all k ∈ K. Integrate the above equality over K we get

                     TX⊗1 φ̃(1) = TX̃⊗1 φ̃(1) = σ(X̃ ∨ ) ◦ (φ̃(1)) = 0.

Therefore φ̃ = 0 since it is real analytic and the group G is connected.
     Let V0 = Span{ φ(x) | x ∈ G } be a subspace of

                          EndC (W ) = EndC (L) ⊗ EndC (W0 ).

Since V0 is K × K stable,

                                 V0 = V1 ⊗ EndC (W0 )

for some subspace V1 of EndC (L). Now it’s clear that φ̃ = 0 implies V1 = 0, and
consequently φ = 0.                                                                  

6.2. Matrix coefficient of a bottom layer. Now we are able to get the result
on the matrix coefficients of a bottom layer of a cohomologically induced module.
Let M = RS (M ′ ) be a cohomologically induced module, where S = dim(n ∩ k)
and M ′ is a finitely generated admissible (g′ , K ′ ) module. Let α, α′ , Wα , Wα′ and
L be as in section 5.3. Assume α is in the bottom layer of M. Denote by

                                  W ′ = M ′ (α′ ) = L ⊗ Wα′

                    ′
as a weak (U(g′ )K , K ′ ) module. Denote by

                                          W = L ⊗ Wα

as a weak (U(g)K , K) module. Proposition 5.5 says that W ∼
                                                          = M(α) as weak
(U(g)K , K) modules. We fix an isomorphism and identify W with M(α). Denote
                                                                                  ′
by σ the actions of U(g)K and K on W ; and σ ′ the actions of U(g′ )K and K ′ on
W ′.
  Define a representation τ of K × K on EndC (W ) by

            τ (k, l)(f ) = σ(k) ◦ f ◦ σ(l−1 ),         k, l ∈ K, f ∈ EndC (W ),

and a representation τ ′ of K ′ × K ′ on EndC (W ′ ) by

          τ ′ (k, l)(f ) = σ ′ (k) ◦ f ◦ σ ′ (l−1 ),   k, l ∈ K ′ , f ∈ EndC (W ′ ).

We have a decomposition

                                    W = W ′ ⊕ σ(n̄ ∩ k)W.

Therefore we may view every element of EndC (W ′ ) as an element of EndC (W )
which vanishes on σ(n̄ ∩ k)W . Denote by

                                jq : EndC (W ′ ) → EndC (W )

the corresponding embedding.

Lemma 6.3. jq induces an isomorphism from τ ′ to the representation q-associated
to τ .

     We omit the straight forward proof.
     We have defined the matrix coefficient cM,α ∈ AW (G). Similarly we have the
matrix coefficient cM ′ ,α′ ∈ AW ′ (G′ ). Proposition 6.2 tells us that cM,α is the unique
element in AW (G) such that

                                        cM,α (1) = 1W .

The same holds for cM ′ ,α′ . Notice that

                  AW (G) ⊂ C∞ (G; τ ) and AW ′ (G′ ) ⊂ C∞ (G′ ; τ ′ ).

Denote by dM,α ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ ) the function corresponds to cM,α in Proposition
2.7. dM ′ ,α′ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ) is defined similarly.
     The main theorem of this section is the following:

Theorem 6.4. With the notations as above, we have

                                        deg(α)
(7)                            dM,α =            Eq(jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ ).
                                        deg(α′ )

6.3. A proof of Theorem 6.4. We need the following elementary lemma.

Lemma 6.5. Let σ be a continuous representation of K on a finite dimensional
vector space W . Let P ∈ EndC (W ) be a linear map which stabilize every irre-
ducible submodule of W . Suppose that P 2 = P and there is a constant c such
that
                                       dim(P (W0 ))
                                                    =c
                                         dim(W0 )
for every irreducible submodule W0 of W . Then
                         Z
                            σ(k −1 ) ◦ P ◦ σ(k) dk = c1W .
                               K
                                EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                                 41

Proof. We assume W is irreducible without lose of generality. Denote by C the
integral in the lemma. It’s clear that C is an intertwining operator. The irre-
ducibility of W implies that C = c′ 1W for some constant c′ . By taking trace of
both side of the above equality we get c′ = c.                                       
  Now we are going to prove the theorem. It’s clear from the definition of Eq that
                                    Z
              Eq(jq ◦ dM ,α )(1U) =
                        ′  ′           σ(k −1 ) ◦ jq(1W ′ ) ◦ σ(k) dk
                                            K

                                                                              deg(α′ )
jq(1W ′ ) satisfies the conditions on P in Lemma 6.5, with the constant c =   deg(α)
                                                                                       .
Therefore Lemma 6.5 implies that

                             Eq(jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ )(1U) = c1W .

This proves that both hand side of (7) has value 1W at the point 1U. Denote by

                                 ψ0 = Eq(jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ ),

and φ0 the corresponding function in C∞ (G; τ ). By Proposition 6.2, we only need
to show that φ0 ∈ AW (G) to finish the proof.
  Let X ⊗ Y ∈ U(g)K ⊗ U(g)K . We easily check that the following diagram
commutes:
                                              jq

                            EndC (W ′ ) −−−→ EndC (W ),
where A′ is defined by

                          f ′ 7→ σ ′ (ξ(X ∨)) ◦ f ′ ◦ σ ′ (ξ(Y )),

and A is defined by

                                f 7→ σ(X ∨ ) ◦ f ◦ σ(Y ).

  As (ξ ∨(X))∨ = ξ(X ∨ ) and cM ′ ,α′ ∈ AW ′ (G′ ), we have

                          Tξ′∨ (X)⊗ξ(Y ) (cM ′ ,α′ ) = A′ ◦ cM ′ ,α′ .
42                                           SUN BINYONG

Now Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.5 implies that

(8)                              Tξ′∨ (X)⊗ξ(Y ) (dM ′ ,α′ ) = A′ ◦ dM ′ ,α′ .

     We have

        TX⊗Y (ψ0 )

      = TX⊗Y Eq(jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ )

      = Eq(Tξ′∨ (X)⊗ξ(Y ) (jq ◦ dM ′,α′ ))              Theorem 4.1

      = Eq(jq ◦ (Tξ′∨ (X)⊗ξ(Y ) (dM ′,α′ )))

      = Eq(jq ◦ A′ ◦ dM ′ ,α′ )                         By (8)

      = Eq(A ◦ jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ )                          By the above commutative diagram

      = A ◦ Eq(jq ◦ dM ′ ,α′ )                          A commutes the action of K × K

      = A ◦ ψ0 .

Again Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.5 implies

                                          TX⊗Y φ0 = A ◦ φ0 .

Therefore φ0 ∈ AW (G). This finishes the proof of Theorem 6.4.

6.4. An example on Aq(λ) modules. We discuss the case when dim(M ′ ) = 1
as an example. Let

                                              λ : G′ → C×

be a continuous character, unitary or not. Still denote by λ its holomorphic exten-
sion to G′C and its differential. Fix a maximal torus Tmax of K ′ with complexified
Lie algebra t. Then Tmax is also a maximal torus of K. Let

                                            Λ = λ|t + δn∩p|t.
                                 EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                                       43

Let α be the K type with an extremal weight Λ. Assume that Λ is dominant with
respect to n ∩ k. Then λ|K ′ is the K ′ type q-associated to α, and α is the unique
bottom layer of Aq(λ). Recall that Aq(λ) is just the cohomologically induced
module RS (λ). For every x ∈ G, denote by

                                           1
                           φq,λ(x) =            Tr(cAq (λ),α (x)).
                                         deg(α)

  Let σ0 be an irreducible unitary representation of K on Wα , of type α. Fix
a unit vector v0 in Wα , of weight Λ. Let PΛ ∈ EndC (Wα ) be the orthogonal

This formula confirms the assumption in Theorem 4.3 of [10] as a special case.


                                    7. Li positivity

  In this sections, we discuss a positivity property on representations as an exam-
ple of the application of our Eisenstein integral. This positivity property is very
useful in the study of branching rules, for example, in the study of theta corre-
spondence. All the omitted proofs in this section can be found in the author’s
HKUST thesis.

7.1. The definition of Li positivity. Let σ be a finite dimensional continuous
unitary representation of K on W . Define a representation τ of K×K on EndC (W )
by

              τ (k, l)(f ) = σ(k) ◦ f ◦ σ(l−1 ),     k, l ∈ K, f ∈ EndC (W ).

Recall that an operator A ∈ EndC (W ) is said to be positive definite if

                                 hAv, vi ≥ 0,        v ∈ W.


Definition 7.1. Let φ ∈ C∞ (G; τ ). φ is said to be Li positive if φ(x) is positive
definite for all x ∈ exp(p0 ). Let ψ ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ ). ψ is said to be Li positive if
ψ(x) is positive definite for all x ∈ GC /U.


     We use this terminology since such kinds of properties are firstly used by Jian-
Shu Li in the study of theta correspondence [9], [10], [5]. If φ ∈ C∞ (G; τ ) is
Li positive, then Tr ◦φ satisfies Flensted-Jensen’s formula in Jian-Shu Li’s ter-
minology. In some sense, the concept of Li positivity is dual to that of positive
definiteness of functions.
     The following lemma will be used later.


Lemma 7.2. Let φ ∈ C∞ (G; τ ) and ψ ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ ) be a pair of corresponding
functions in Proposition 2.7. Then φ is Li positive if and only if ψ is Li positive.


Proof. The ”if” part is clear. Assume φ is Li positive. Let x ∈ GC /U. Recall that
we have a complexification square S:
                                                pK
                                     G/K −−−→         G
                                                     
                                        
                                     vG y
                                                      u
                                                      y G
                                                pU
                                     GC /U −−−→ GC .

Since

                                  GC /U = KC .vG (G/K),
                                 EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                               45

we have
                      x = k.vG (y) for some k ∈ KC , y ∈ G/K.

Then
                  ψ(x) = τ (k, k̄)ψ(vG (y)) = σ(k) ◦ φ(pK (y)) ◦ σ(k̄ −1 ).

Notice that pK (y) ∈ exp(p0 ) and σ(k̄ −1 ) is the adjoint operator of σ(k). Therefore
ψ(x) is positive definite.                                                          
  Let M be a finitely generated admissible (g, K) module, α a K type. We say
that α is Li positive in M if
                                        M(α) 6= 0,

and there is a K invariant Hilbert space structure on M(α) so that the matrix
coefficient
                                cM,α : G → EndC (M(α))

is Li positive.
  Notice that the concept of Li positivity can be defined for disconnected real
reductive groups.

7.2. Finite dimensional representations and spherical representations.
The following two examples are not related to our Eisenstein integral. We omit
their easy proofs.

Proposition 7.3. Let
                                     ρ : G → GL(Mρ )

be a finite dimensional continuous representation of G. Assume G has a compact
center. Then there is a K invariant Hilbert space structure on Mρ so that ρ(x) is
positive definite for every x ∈ exp(p0 ).

Proposition 7.4. If M is a spherical irreducible (g, K) module with real infini-
tesimal character, then the trivial K type is Li positive in M.
46                                    SUN BINYONG

7.3. Li positivity of our Eisenstein integrals. Let σ be a finite dimensional
unitary representation of K on W . Let σ ′ be the representation of K ′ on W ′ which
is q-associated to σ. Notice that σ ′ is also a unitary representation. The Hilbert
space structure on W ′ is the restriction of that on W . Define a representation
τ of K × K on EndC (W ), a representation τ ′ of K ′ × K ′ on EndC (W ′ ), and an
injection

                             jq : EndC (W ′ ) → EndC (W )

as in section 6.2.

Proposition 7.5. Let φ ∈ C∞ (G′C /U ′ ; τ ′ ). If φ is Li positive, then

                                Eq(jq ◦ φ) ∈ C∞ (GC /U; τ )

is also Li positive.

Proof. Notice that

                                  W = W ′ ⊕ σ(n̄ ∩ k)W

is an orthogonal decomposition. Therefore jq maps positive definite operators to
positive definite operators. Write

                                       φ′ = jq ◦ φ.

Then δqR φ′ has positive definite values everywhere. Notice that σ(k −1 ) is the
adjoint operator of σ(k) for all k ∈ K. Therefore, for every x ∈ GC /U,

                          Eq(jq ◦ φ : x)
                          Z
                        =     τ (k −1 , k −1 )(δqR φ′ )(Hq(kx)) dk
                            K
                          Z
                        =     σ(k −1 ) ◦ ((δqR φ′ )(Hq(kx))) ◦ σ(k) dk
                            K

is positive definite.                                                             

7.4. Li positivity of Bottom layers. Let M ′ be a finitely generated admissible
(g′ , K ′ ) module. M = RS (M ′ ) as before. Let α be a K type which is in the
bottom layer of M. Let α′ be the K ′ type q-associated to α.

Theorem 7.6. If α′ is Li positive in M ′ , then α is Li positive in M.

Proof. Fix an irreducible unitary representation σ0 of K of type α on a vector
space Wα . Let σ0′ be the representation of K ′ on Wα′ which is q-associated to σ0 .
Then σ0′ is an irreducible unitary representation of K ′ of type α′ . Denote by h , iα
the inner product on Wα . The inner product on Wα′ is

                               h , iα′ = h , iα |Wα′ ×Wα′ .

  Write

                              W ′ = M ′ (α′ ) = L ⊗ Wα′

as before. And write

                              W = M(α) = L ⊗ Wα .

Define τ and τ ′ as before. There is a K ′ invariant Hilbert space structure h , i′ on
W ′ so that

                                 cM ′ ,α′ ∈ C∞ (G′ ; τ ′ )

is Li positive. There is a unique Hilbert space structure h , iL on L so that

                               h , i′ = h , iL ⊗ h , iα′ .

Define a K invariant Hilbert structure

                                h , i = h , iL ⊗ h , iα

on W . Then

                                 h , i′ = h , i|W ′×W ′ .

We conclude the proof by using Lemma 7.2, Theorem 6.4 and Proposition 7.5. 

7.5. Aq(λ). We use the notations in section 6.4. Assume that


                                   Λ = λ|t + δn∩p|t


is dominant with respect to n ∩ k. Let a0 be the centralizer of t in p0 . Notice that
(t ∩ k0 ) ⊕ a0 is a fundamental Cartan subalgebra of g0 . The above theorem implies
that if λ|a0 is real, then the K type α in the bottom layer is Li positive in Aq(λ).
In particular, if M is a discrete series, a limit of discrete series, or an irreducible
unitary representation with nonzero cohomology, then the unique minimal K type
of M is Li positive. The first two cases are essentially known to Flensted-Jensen
[2], and some of the third case are known to Michael Harris and Jian-Shu Li [5].


7.6. Lowest weight module. Assume G is of Hermitian type and


                                    p = p+ ⊕ p− ,


where both p+ and p− are K invariant abelian subspaces of p, and


                                      p+ = p− .


Assume

                                     q = k ⊕ p+ .

Fix an irreducible continuous unitary representation σ0 of K on Wα , of type α.
Define a (g, K) module

                                M = U(g) ⊗U(q̄) Wα .

Here we view Wα a q̄ module via the trivial p− action. The U(g) action on M is
via left multiplication. The K action on M is via the tensor product. It’s clear
that

                                    M(α) = Wα .
                                EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                             49

It’ easy to determine the action of U(g)K on M(α). Then we are able to express
dM,α in terms of Eisenstein integral for θ stable parabolic. It turns out that
                           Z
                    2
            cM,α (kx ) =       σ0 (kl−1 H̃q(lx)l) dl,   k ∈ K, x ∈ exp(p0 ),
                           K


where

                                  H̃q : G → KC = G′C

is defined in section 6.4. Notice that

                                             √
                                H̃q(G) ⊂ exp( −1k0 ),


and therefore σ0 ◦ H̃q has positive definite values everywhere. This implies that α
is Li positive in M. Nollan Wallach and Jian-Shu Li have another expression of
Tr ◦cM,α in the unitary case [9].


7.7. SL2 (R).


Proposition 7.7. Assume G = SL2 (R). Let M be an irreducible (g, K) module.
If M has a real infinitesimal character, then every minimal K type is Li positive
in M.


Proof. We use the well know result on the classification of irreducible representa-
tions of SL2 (R). There are 4 cases:

   (1) M is a finite dimensional (g, K) module;
   (2) M is the (g, K) module of a discrete series representation;
   (3) M is the (g, K) module of a limit of discrete series representation;
   (4) M is the (g, K) module of an irreducible principle series representation.

The first 3 cases are already known. The fourth case can be proved by an explicit
calculation and a trivial estimate.                                              

7.8. Branching rules. Let’s mention a useful branching rule relative to Li pos-
itivity.
     Let M be a finitely generated admissible (g, K) module. Recall that there is a
                                                         c of M. M
canonical globalization (or called smooth globalization) M       c is uniquely

determined by the following
          c is a smooth Frechet representation of G;
      (1) M
                               c is M;
      (2) The (g, K) module of M
          c has moderate growth.
      (3) M

For more details of the globalization, see chapter 11 of [19]. We note that every
                                                            c Let u ∈ M c ,
element of M c extends to a continuous linear functional on M.
  c. Recall that the matrix coefficient cM (u ⊗ v) ∈ C∞ (G; C) is defined by
v∈M

                         cM (u ⊗ v)(g) = u(g.v),       g ∈ G.


Definition 7.8. Let M be a finitely generated admissible (g, K) module, H a
unimodular closed subgroup of G. Fix a Haar measure on H. M is said to be L1
on H if

                                                               c
                 cM (u ⊗ v)|H ∈ L1 (H) for every u ∈ M c , v ∈ M,

and the map
                                c → L1 (H),
                                M
                                 v 7→ cM (u ⊗ v)|H

is continuous for every u ∈ M c .


     Let G1 be a closed real reductive subgroup of G so that θ(G1 ) = G1 . Then θ
induces an Cartan involution on G1 . Denote by

                                    K1 = K ∩ G 1 ,

and g1 the complexified Lie algebra of G1 .
                                EISENSTEIN INTEGRALS                              51

Proposition 7.9. Let M be a finitely generated admissible (g, K) module, M1 a
finitely generated admissible (g1 , K1 ) module. Let α be a K type and α1 a K1 type.
Assume that

   (1) The finitely generated (g×g1 , K×K1 ) module M ⊗M1c is L1 on the subgroup
       ∆(G1 ) of G × G1 , where ∆(G1 ) means the diagonal subgroup;
   (2) α is Li positive in M; α1 is Li positive in M1 .

Then

            dim(Hom(g1 ,K1 ) (M, M1 )) ≥ dim(HomK1 (M(α), M1 (α1 ))).


  There is also a unitary version of the above branching rule.

7.9. Final remarks. Let M be an irreducible (g, K) module, α a K type oc-
curring in M. Assume now α is a minimal K type. We use Vogan-Zuckerman’s
classification of irreducible (g, K) modules. There is a θ stable parabolic subalge-
bra q, two (g′ , K ′ ) module M ′ and P ′ , depending on M, such that

   (1) M = RS (M ′ ), where S = dim(n ∩ k) as usual;
   (2) G′ is quasi-split; P ′ is a principle series (g′ , K ′ ) module;
   (3) α is in the bottom layer of M, α′ is a fine K ′ type occurring in P ′ , where
       α′ is the K ′ type q-associated to α;
   (4) M ′ is the irreducible subquotient of P ′ so that M ′ (α′ ) = P ′ (α′ ).

Theorem 6.4 enable us to express cM,α in terms of cM ′ ,α′ . We know that

                                     cM ′ ,α′ = cP ′ ,α′

can be easily expressed as an ordinary Eisenstein integral. Theorem 7.6 reduces
the question of Li positivity of α to that of α′ . But in general, it’s difficult
to see when does an ordinary Eisenstein integral preserves Li positivity. This
phenomena is opposite to the question on unitarizability: it’s easy to see that
ordinary parabolic inductions preserves unitarity, but it’s rather difficult to see
52                                       SUN BINYONG

when is the cohomological induction preserves unitarity. I hope the following is
true for a large class of G (Maybe all):
     Let M be an irreducible (g, K) module with real infinitesimal character λ. Let
α be a K type occurring in it. If the size of α is smaller than the size of λ in some
sense, then α is Li positive in M.
     The definition of Eisenstein integral for θ stable parabolic subalgebras can be
generalized to reductive symmetric spaces, as Flensted-Jensen did for discrete
series.
     For applications to branching rules and other aspects of representation theory,
we need a careful study of the growth condition. On the other hand, our results
have some consequences on the growth of representations. We hope to do these
in other papers.
