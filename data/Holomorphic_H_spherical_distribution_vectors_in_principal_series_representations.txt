                                                                                           Abstract
                                             Let G/H be a semisimple symmetric space. The main tool to embed a principal series represen-
                                             tation of G into L2 (G/H) are the H -invariant distribution vectors. If G/H is a non-compactly
                                             causal symmetric space, then G/H can be realized as a boundary component of the complex
                                             crown Ξ. In this article we construct a minimal G-invariant subdomain ΞH of Ξ with G/H as
                                             Shilov boundary. Let π be a spherical principal series representation of G. We show that the
                                             space of H -invariant distribution vectors of π , which admit a holomorphic extension to ΞH , is
                                             one dimensional. Furthermore we give a spectral definition of a Hardy space corresponding to
                                             those distribution vectors. In particular we achieve a geometric realization of a multiplicity free
                                             subspace of L2 (G/H)mc in a space of holomorphic functions.



                                                                                       Introduction
                                             Holomorphic extensions and boundary value maps have been valuable tools to solve problems in
                                             representation theory and harmonic analysis on real symmetric spaces. Two of the best known
                                             constructions are Hardy spaces with their boundary value maps and Cauchy-Szegö-kernels, and
                                             Fock space constructions with their corresponding Segal-Barmann transform. It is in this flavour
                                             that we establish a correspondence between eigenfunctions on a Riemannian symmetric spaces
                                             X = G/K and a non-compactly causal (NCC) symmetric spaces Y = G/H in this paper. In
                                             particular we, via analytic continuation, relate a spherical function ϕλ on G/K to a holomorphic
                                             H -invariant distribution on G/H .
                                                    Let us explain our results in more detail. On the geometric level we construct a certain
                                             minimal G-invariant Stein domain ΞH ⊆ XC = GC /KC with the following properties: The
                                             Riemannian symmetric space X is embedded into ΞH as a totally real submanifold and the
                                             affine non-compactly causal space Y is isomorphic to the distinguished (Shilov) boundary of
                                             ΞH . The details of this construction are carried out in Section 1.
                                                    The minimal tube ΞH is a subdomain of the complex crown Ξ ⊆ XC of X – an object
                                             first introduced in [AG90] which became subject of intense study over the last few years. A

consequence is that all D(X)-eigenfunctions on X extend holomorphically to ΞH [KS01b].
Another key fact is that D(X) ≃ D(Y ). Thus by taking limits on the boundary Y we obtain
a realization of the D(X)-eigenfunctions on X as D(Y )-eigenfunctions on Y . Conversely,
eigenfunctions on Y which holomorphically extend to ΞH yield by restriction eigenfunctions
on X .
      It seems to us that the above mentioned transition between eigenfunctions on X and Y is
most efficiently described using the techniques from representation theory. To fix the notation let
(π, H) denote an admissible Hilbert representation of G with finite length. We write HK for the
space of K -fixed vectors and (H−∞ )H for the space of H -fixed distribution vectors of π . Using
the method of analytic continuation of representations as developed in [KS01a] we establish a
bijection
                                         ≃
                                  HK −−−−→(H−∞ )H   hol , vK 7→ vH

where (H−∞ )H  hol ⊆ (H
                         −∞ H
                            ) denotes the subspace characterized through the property that
associated matrix coefficients on Y extend holomorphically to ΞH (cf. Theorem 2.1.3, Theorem
2.2.4). This bijection and various ramifications are the subject proper of Section 2.
      In Section 3 we give an application of our theory towards the geometric realization of the
most-continuous spectrum L2 (Y )mc of L2 (Y ). First progress in this direction was achieved in
[GKÓ01]. There, for the cases where Ξ = ΞH , we defined a Hardy space H2 (Ξ) on Ξ and
showed that there is an isometric boundary value mapping realizing H2 (Ξ) as a multiplicity one
subspace of L2 (Y )mc of full spectrum. It was an open problem how to define Hardy spaces for
general NCC symmetric spaces Y and to determine the Plancherel measure explicitely. We solve
this problem by giving a spectral definition of the Hardy space, i.e., we take the conjectured
Plancherel measure and define a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions H2 (ΞH ) on ΞH . The
identification of H2 (ΞH ) as a Hardy space then follows by establishing an isometric boundary
value mapping b: H2 (ΞH ) ֒→ L2 (G/H)mc . In particular we achieve a geometric realization of a
multiplicity free subspace of L2 (Y )mc in holomorphic functions.
      It is our pleasure to thank the referee for his very careful work. He pointed out many
inaccuracies and made useful remarks on the presentation of the paper.



                    1. Complex crowns and the domains ΞH

The purpose of this section is to give the geometric preliminaries of the analytical constructions
to come. Our two main players are a Riemannian symmetric space G/K on the one hand side
and on the other hand a non-compactly causal symmetric space G/H . The two symmetric spaces
G/K and G/H are “connected” through a complex G-invariant domain ΞH ⊆ GC /KC in the
following way: G/K is a totally real submanifold and G/H constitutes the distinguished (Shilov)
boundary of ΞH . The domain ΞH constructed in this section is an appropriate subdomain of
the complex crown Ξ of the Riemannian symmetric space G/K .
      This section is organized as follows. We start by briefly recalling the defintion and some
standard features of non-compactly causal symmetric spaces . Then we switch to complex crowns
Ξ and summarize the main results of [GK02a] on how to realize G/H in the distinguished
boundary of Ξ. Finally we give the construction of the domain ΞH .

                  1.1. Non-compactly causal symmetric spaces (NCC)
In this subsection we recall some facts on non-compactly causal symmetric spaces. The material
is standard and can be found in the monograph [HÓ96].
      Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group and g be its Lie algebra. Denote by gC = g⊗R C
the complexification of g. If h is a subalgebra of g, then we denote by hC the complex subalgebra
of gC generated by h. We assume that G is contained in a complex group GC with Lie algebra
gC .
      If σ: G → G is an involution, then, by abuse of notation, we use the same letter for the
derived involution on the Lie algebra g and its complex linear extension to gC .
      Let θ: G → G be a Cartan involution and denote by K < G the corresponding maximal
compact subgroup. Let k = {X ∈ g: θ(X) = X} and p = {X ∈ g: θ(X) = −X} . Then k is the
Lie algebra of K .
      In the sequel we let τ denote an involution on G which we may assume to commute with
θ . Let Gτ := {g ∈ G: τ (g) = g} and let H be an open subgroup of Gτ . Then G/H is called a
symmetric spaces. On the Lie algebra level τ induces a splitting g = h + q with h the +1 and
q the −1 -eigenspace of τ . Notice that h is the Lie algebra of H . The pair (g, h) is called a
symmetric pair. We have, as θ and τ commute:

                                 g=k+p
                                   =h+q
                                   = k∩h+k∩q+p∩h+p∩q

      The symmetric pair (g, h) is called irreducible if the only τ -invariant ideals in g are
the trivial ones, {0} and g. In this case either g is simple or g ≃ h ⊕ h, with h simple,
and τ (X, Y ) = (Y, X) the flip. We say that the symmetric space G/H is irreducible if the
corresponding symmetric pair (g, h) is irreducible.
      Let Ø 6= C ⊆ g be an open subset of g. Then C is said to be hyperbolic if for all X ∈ C
the map ad(X) : g → g is semisimple with real eigenvalues.

Definition 1.1.1.       (NCC) Assume that G/H is an irreducible symmetric space. Then the
following two conditions are equivalent:
  (a) There exists a non-empty H -invariant open hyperbolic convex cone C ⊆ q which contains
      no affine lines;
  (b) There exists an element T0 ∈ q ∩ p , T0 6= 0 , which is fixed by H ∩ K .
      If one of those equivalent conditions are satisfied, then G/H is called non-compactly causal,
or NCC for short.

Remark 1.1.2. (a) The element T0 in Definition 1.1.1 is unique up to multiplication by scalar.
We can normalize T0 such that ad(T0 ) has spectrum {0, 1, −1} . The eigenspace corresponding
to 0 is exactly gθτ = k ∩ h + p ∩ q .
(b) If G/H is NCC and a ⊂ p ∩ q is maximal abelian, then T0 ∈ a by (a). Hence, again by (a),
it follows that a is also maximal abelian in p and in q .
(c) Let T0 be as above. Then the interior of the convex hull of R+ Ad(H)T0 is a minimal,
H -invariant open hyperbolic convex cone in q .
(d) All the NCC pairs (g, h) are classified and we refer to [HÓ96, Th. 3.2.8] for the complete
list.

              1.2. The complex crown of a Riemannian symmetric space
The NCC spaces are exactly the affine symmetric spaces that can be realized as a symmetric
subspace in the distinguished boundary of the complex crown Ξ of the Riemannian symmetric
space G/K . We will therefore recall some basic facts about Ξ. We refer to [GK02a] and [GK02b]
as a standard source.
      Let the notation be as in Subsection 1.1. Let a ⊆ p be a maximal abelian subalgebra. For
α ∈ a∗ let gα = {X ∈ g: (∀H ∈ a) [H, X] = α(H)X} and let Σ := {α ∈ a∗ : α 6= 0, gα 6= {0}} be
the corresponding set of restricted roots.
      Following [AG90] we define a bounded convex subset of a by

                                                                        π
                                Ω = {X ∈ a: (∀α ∈ Σ) |α(X)| <             }.
                                                                        2

Denote by KC the analytic subgroup of GC with Lie algebra kC . Then we define a G − KC
double coset domain in GC by

                                           e = G exp(iΩ)KC
                                           Ξ
                e is open in GC [KS01a]. In particular the domain
and recall that Ξ

                                                     e C
                                                 Ξ = Ξ/K

is an open G-invariant subset of GC /KC containing G/K as a totally real submanifold. We
refer to Ξ as the complex crown of the Riemannian symmetric space G/K (cf. [AG90]). Observe
that the definition of Ξ and Ξe is independent of the choice of a ⊆ p . For a subset ω ⊆ a we
define a tube domain in AC = exp(aC ) by

                                           T (ω) = A exp(iω)

and notice that T (2Ω) is biholomorphic to a + i2Ω via the exponential map.
      Fix a positive system Σ+ of Σ and define a subalgebra n of g by
                                                      M
                                             n=              gα .
                                                      α∈Σ+


Write NC for the analytic subgroup of GC with Lie algebra nC . Then it follows from [GK02b]
that

                          1.3. The distinguished boundary of Ξ
Write Ξ and ∂Ξ for the closure respectively the boundary of Ξ in GC /KC . The distinguished
boundary of Ξ is a certain finite union of G-orbits in ∂Ξ which features many properties of
a Shilov boundary. It was introduced and investigated in [GK02a] and the objective of this
subsection is to recall its definition and basic properties.
      Let W = NK (a)/ZK (a) be the Weyl group of a in G. Write Ω for the closure of Ω and
notice that Ω is a W -invariant compact convex set. Denote by ∂e Ω the set of extreme points of
Ω. Then there exists X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ ∂e Ω such that

                                 ∂e Ω = W(X1 ) ∐ . . . ∐ W(Xn ) .

Define the distinguished boundary of Ξ in GC /KC by

                                  ∂d Ξ: = G exp(i∂e Ω)KC /KC .

We refer to [GK02a] for detailed information about ∂d Ξ and recall here only the facts that we
need.
      For 1 ≤ j ≤ n let zj : = exp(iXj )KC ∈ ∂d Ξ. If GC is not simply connected it can happen
that G(zj ) = G(zk ) for some j 6= k . But after relabelling the zj we can assume that there is an
m ≤ n such that G(zj ) 6= G(zk ) for 1 ≤ j, k ≤ m, j 6= k , and

                                  ∂d Ξ = G(z1 ) ∐ . . . ∐ G(zm ) .

Denote by Hj the isotropy subgroup of G in zj . Then as G-spaces we have

                                  ∂d Ξ = G/H1 ∐ . . . ∐ G/Hm .
As a consequence of the complete classification of ∂d Ξ in [GK02a] we obtain the following fact.

Proposition 1.3.1. For the distinguished boundary ∂d Ξ of Ξ the following assertions hold:
  (i) If one of the boundary components G/Hj of ∂d Ξ is a symmetric space, then it is a non-
      compactly causal symmetric space.
 (ii) Every non-compactly causal symmetric space of the form G/H is locally isomorphic to a
      G-orbit in the distinguished boundary of ∂d Ξ of Ξ.




                                    1.4. The domains ΞH
We keep the notation from Subsections 1.2 - 1.3. From now on we fix an element XH ∈ ∂e Ω and
set xH = exp(iXH ), zH = xH KC . As the notation suggests we denote by H < G the stabilizer of
zH ∈ ∂d Ξ in G.
      For the rest of this paper we will employ the following assumptions: GC is simply connected
and G/H ≃ G(zH ) is an NCC symmetric space (cf. Proposition 1.3.1). Notice that this implies
in particular H = Gτ . Recall the element T0 from Definition 1.1.1 and notice that we have (up
to sign) XH = π2 T0 .
      We define a domain ΩH ⊆ Ω by

                                   ΩH = int (conv{W(XH )}) .
  6                           Simon Gindikin, Bernhard Krötz and Gestur Ólafsson

  Here conv{·} denotes the convex hull of {·} and int(·) denotes the interior of (·). From the
  definition we immediately obtain that:
(1.4.1) ΩH is open in a .
(1.4.2) 0 ∈ ΩH (because XH 6= 0 and W(XH ) meets every Weyl chamber).
(1.4.3) The set of extremal points of ΩH is W(XH ).
          Let us illustrate the geometry for one example.

  Example 1.4.1. Let G = Sl(3, R). Then a is two-dimensional and Σ is a root system of type
  A2 . We have ∂e Ω = W(X1 ) ∐ W(X2 ) and the corresponding isotropy subgroups are given by
  H1 = SO(1, 2) and H2 = SO(2, 1). With H = H1 the geometry of Ω and ΩH is depicted as
  follows:


                           X2



                                              X1 = XH



                                                                               ΩH
                          Ω




  Let us define a domain ΞH ⊆ GC /KC by

                                        ΞH = G exp(iΩH )KC /KC .

  The domain ΞH has the following properties:
(1.4.4)   ΞH is G-invariant (clear from the definition).
(1.4.5)   ΞH is open in GC /KC (follows from (1.4.1) and [AG90]).
(1.4.6)   G/K ⊆ ΞH is a totally real submanifold (follows from (1.4.2) and (1.4.5)).
(1.4.7)   ΞH is Stein (follows from the convexity of ΩH and [GK02b]).
(1.4.8)   ΞH ⊆ Ξ (because ΩH ⊆ Ω).
(1.4.9)   ΞH = Ξ iff Σ is of type Cn (cf. [KS01b]).
  Write ΞH for the closure of ΞH in GC /KC and define the distinguished boundary of ΞH by

                                              ∂d ΞH = G(zH ) .

  Notice that ∂d ΞH ≃ G/H as G-spaces. Let us remark further that ∂d ΞH ⊆ ∂d Ξ.

     The distinguished boundary ∂d ΞH of ΞH can be considered as some sort of Shilov boundary
of ΞH . More precisely, mimicking the argument in [GK02a, Th. 2.3] we obtain that


(1.4.10)                        supz∈ΞH |f (z)| = supz∈∂d ΞH | |f (z)|

for all bounded holomorphic functions f on ΞH which continuously extend to ΞH .



                    2. Holomorphic H -spherical distributions

In the section we assume that G/H is NCC symmetric space realized as G(zH ) in the distin-
guished boundary of Ξ.
      Recall that a representation (π, V ) of G is called admissible if the multiplicity of each
K -type is finite and of finite length if the associated Harish-Chandra module of K -finite vectors
VK is of finite length. Our aim in this section is to associate to a non-zero K -fixed vector vK in
an admissible representation (π, V ) of finite length a certain canonical H -spherical distribution
vector vH ∈ (V −∞ )H . For irreducible representations π the vector vH is unique in the sense
that it allows analytic continuation of generalized matrix coefficients on G/H to holomorphic
functions on ΞH .
      We let XH , xH , and zH be as in the last subsection and recall that x−1
                                                                             H
                                                                               HC xH = KC .
General Remark: In all results of this section which involve the domain ΞH one can replace
ΞH by the bigger domain Ξ. This holds in particular for the results in Subsection 2.2.



       2.1. The definition of the holomorphic H -spherical distribution vector
Before we discuss the general case let us assume for the moment that V is irreducible and finite
dimensional. Then (π, V ) extends to a holomorphic representation of GC which we also denote
by (π, V ). If L < G is a subgroup of G then we write V L for the subspace of V fixed by L .
Then the mapping
                               V K → V H , vK 7→ vH : = π(xH )vK
sets up an isomorphism between the K -spherical and H -spherical vectors of V . The obvious
problem in the general case is, that π(xH )v is not necessarily defined as an element in V .
       We are now going to develop an appropriate generalization of the mapping vK 7→ vH for
an admissible finite length representation (π, H) of G in a Hilbert space H . Denote by H∞
respectively Hω the space of smooth respectively analytic vectors in H . Their strong anti-duals,
i.e., the space of continuous conjugate linear maps into C, are denoted by H−∞ respectively
H−ω and referred to as the G-modules of distribution vectors, respectively hyperfunction vectors
of (π, H). Notice the chain of continuous inclusions Hω ֒→ H∞ ֒→ H ֒→ H−∞ ֒→ H−ω . Here
the inclusion H ֒→ H−∞ is the natural one, v 7→ (u 7→ hv, ui). We will also use the notation
u 7→ hv, ui for v ∈ H−∞ . Define a representation π 0 of G on H by

                       hπ 0 (g)v, ui = hπ(g −1 )∗ v, ui
                                                            (g ∈ G; u, v ∈ H) .
                                    = hv, π(g −1 )ui

Hence the natural representation π −∞ of G on H−∞ is an extension of the representation π 0
on H to H−∞ . The representation π 0 is called the conjugate dual representation of π . Notice
8                         Simon Gindikin, Bernhard Krötz and Gestur Ólafsson

that (π 0 , H) is admissible and of finite length if and only if the same holds for (π, H). Note also
that π = π 0 if and only if π is unitary. Notice that if u, v ∈ H then hv, ui = hu, vi. Accordingly,
if u ∈ H∞ and v ∈ H−∞ , then we write

                                          hu, vi := hv, ui .

      Denote by HK the (g, K)-module of K -finite vectors in H . Note that by our assumption
that H is admissible and of finite length it follows that HK ⊆ Hω . But usually we cannot find
H -fixed vectors in H but only in the larger space of distribution vectors. Another complication
arises as the space of (H−∞ )H of H -invariants in H−∞ is finite dimensional but in general not
one-dimensional. For “generic” principal series representations of G one has

                                     dim(H−∞ )H = |W/W0 |

with W0 = NK∩H (a)/ZK∩H (a) the little Weyl group. Our correspondence will be that we
associate to a K -fixed vector vK a unique H -fixed distribution vector vH . If π is irreducible,
then this distribution vH is the (up to scalar) unique element of (H−∞ )H for which generalized
matrix coefficients extend to holomorphic functions from G/H to Ξ. For the proof we will
need the following Automatic Continuity Theorem of van den Ban, Brylinski and Delorme (c.f.
[vdBD88, Th. 2.1] and [BD92, Th. 1] for the version used here).
      If V is a complex vector space, then let us denote by V ∗ its algebraic anti-dual. Set
(H ) = {v ∈ H−∞ : (∀X ∈ h) dπ −∞ (X)v = 0} .
   −∞ h



Theorem 2.1.1. (Automatic Continuity) Let (π, H) be an admissible representation of G
with finite length. Then

(2.1.1)                                             ∗ h
                                       (H−∞ )H0 ≃ (HK ) ,

meaning every h-fixed anti-linear functional on HK admits a unique extension to a continuous
and H0 -fixed anti-linear functional on H∞ . In particular we have that

(2.1.2)                              (H−∞ )H0 ≃ (H−ω )H0 .



     Recall the G − KC double coset domain Ξ  e = G exp(iΩ)KC in GC and the complex crown
    e
Ξ = Ξ/KC . Our methods use holomorphic extensions of representations. We recall therefore
some results from [KS01a] §4 and in particular Theorem 3.1:

Theorem 2.1.2.      Let (π, H) be an admissible Hilbert representation of G with finite length.
Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) For every v ∈ HK the orbit mapping G → H, g 7→ π(g)v extends to a G-equivariant
      holomorphic mapping Ξ e → H.
 (ii) Let v, w ∈ HK . Then the restricted matrix coefficient A → C, a 7→ hπ(a)v, wi extends to
      a holomorphic mapping to the abelian tube domain T (2Ω) = A exp(2iΩ).
      We will from now on assume that π |K is unitary. This is no restriction in view of Weyl’s
unitarity trick.
      As before we identify G/H with the subset G(zH ) of ΞH . For 0 ≤ t < 1 we set
at = exp(itXH ) ∈ exp(iΩ) and notice that limt→1 at = xH .

Theorem 2.1.3.      Let (π, H) be a K -spherical admissible representation of G with finite
length. Let vK ∈ HK be non-zero. Then the anti-linear functional

                                 vHω : Hω → C, v 7→ lim hπ 0 (at )vK , vi
                                                            tր1

is well defined, non-zero and admits a non-trivial extension to an H -fixed distribution vector of
(π, H).

Note: If (π, H) is unitary, then π 0 (at ) = π(at ) and so vHω (v) = limtր1 hπ(at )vK , vi for all
v ∈ Hω .
Proof.    We first show that vHω is well defined. Let v ∈ Hω . As v is analytic, we find an
0 < ε < 1 such that π(aε )v is defined. Notice that π 0 (a1−ε )vK is defined by Theorem 2.1.2 (i).
Then we have for all ε < t < 1 that
                                 hπ 0 (at )vK , vi = hπ 0 (at−ε )vK , π(aε )vi
and hence
                              lim hπ 0 (at )vK , vi = hπ 0 (a1−ε )vK , π(aε )vi .
                              tր1

Thus vHω is defined.
     Next we show that vHω is fixed by H . As G/H is NCC, it follows that H = H0 ZH∩K (a)
[HÓ96, p.79]. Further it is clear from the definition that vHω it is fixed by ZH∩K (a). Hence it is
enough to prove that vHω is H0 -fixed, i.e. annihilated by h. For that let Y ∈ h and v ∈ Hω .
Then

                vHω (dπ(Y )v) = lim hπ 0 (at )vK , dπ(Y )vi = − lim hdπ 0 (Y )π 0 (at )vK , vi
                                 tր1                                    tր1
                                            0          0          −1
                              = − lim hπ (at )dπ (Ad(at )              Y )vK , vi
                                    tր1

                              = − lim hπ 0 (at−ε )dπ 0 (Ad(at )−1 Y )vK , π(aε )vi .
                                    tր1

From Theorem 2.1.2 (i) we now obtain that
                   π 0 (at−ε )dπ 0 (Ad(at )−1 Y )vK → π 0 (a1−ε )dπ 0 (Ad(xH )−1 Y )vK .
But Ad(xH )−1 Y ∈ kC and hence dπ 0 (Ad(xH )−1 Y )vK = 0 . We thus get:
                     vHω (dπ(Y )v) = − lim hπ 0 (at−ε )dπ 0 (Ad(at )−1 Y )vK , π(aε )vi
                                           tր1

                                    = −hπ 0 (a1−ε )dπ 0 (Ad(xH )−1 Y )vK , π(aε )vi
                                    = 0.

      Finally, let us show that vHω 6= 0 . Suppose the contrary, i.e. vHω = 0 . Then it follows that
(2.1.3)                                (∀u ∈ HK )           hvHω , ui = 0 .
Now consider the function
                         f : R + i] − 2, 2[→ C, z 7→ hπ 0 (exp(zXH ))vK , vK i .
According to Theorem 2.1.2 (ii) the function f is well defined and holomorphic. It is clear that
f 6≡ 0 as f (0) = hvK , vK i > 0 . But (2.1.3) implies that f (n) (i) = 0 for all n ∈ N0 ; a contradiction
to f 6≡ 0 .
      In the sequel we write vH for the H -fixed distribution vector obtained from vHω . We will
call vH the holomorphic H -spherical distribution vector of (π, H) corresponding to vK .

Remark 2.1.4. By Theorem 2.1.3 we have

                                       vHω = w − lim π 0 (at )vK ,
                                                      tր1


i.e. vHω is the weak limit of π 0 (at )vK for t → 1 in the locally convex space H−ω . It is possible
to strengthen this convergence: Let v ∈ Hω and C ⊆ G a compact subset. Then for all ε > 0
there exists 0 < s < 1 such that for all 0 < s < t < 1 :


(2.1.4)                    supg∈C |hvHω , π(g)vi − hπ 0 (at )vK , π(g)vi| < ε .

In fact this follows from a simple modification of the first part of the proof of Theorem 2.1.3: we
only have to observe that for v ∈ Hω there exists a 0 < δ < 1 such that π(aδ )π(g)v exists for
all g ∈ C .
       Supported by calculations in the rank one case we conjecture that one actually has
π(at )vK → vH in H−∞ weakly (and hence strongly by the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem which
applies as H∞ is a Fréchet space ).
      Let us illustrate the situation by the discussion of one example.

Example 2.1.5. Here we will determine an explicit analytic description of vH for unitary
principal series of G = Sl(2, R). Let (πλ , Hλ ) denote a unitary spherical principal series of G
with parameter λ ∈ ia∗ . Then πλ0 = πλ as πλ is unitary. In the sequel we will identify a∗C with
C in such a way that ρ ∈ a∗ corresponds to 1 . With our choice of a to be

These two basis vectors are chosen such that they have support in the open H -orbits on P1 (R),
namely ] − 1, 1[ and P1 (R)\[−1, 1]. Notice that vH is a non-trivial linear combination of vH, 1
and vH,2 and that vH has full support on R. Another interesting feature of this example is that

and hence also strongly by the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem (compare with the conjecture stated
at the end of Remark 2.1.4) .




           2.2. Holomorphic extension of matrix coefficienst on G/H to ΞH
In this subsection we clarify the role of the holomorphic distribution vector vH in view of
holomorphic extensions of matrix coefficients from G/H to Ξ. If U is a complex manifold,
then we denote by O(U ) the space of holomorphic functions f : U → C.

Definition 2.2.1.    Let f be a continuous function on G/H . Then we say that f has a
holomorphic extension to ΞH if there exists an fe ∈ O(ΞH ) such that for all compact subsets
C ⊆ G one has

(2.2.1)                       lim supg∈C |f (gH) − fe(gat KC )| = 0 .
                              tր1




      Notice that (2.2.1) implies that

                                       f (gH) = lim fe(gat KC )
                                                           tր1


for all g ∈ G. Furthermore the holomorphic extensions are unique by the following lemma:
12                         Simon Gindikin, Bernhard Krötz and Gestur Ólafsson

Lemma 2.2.2. (Identity Theorem for holomorphic extensions) Let f ∈ C(G/H) and
assume that f has a holomorphic extension fe ∈ O(ΞH ). Then f ≡ 0 implies fe ≡ 0 . In
particular, the holomorphic extension f ∈ C(G/H) is unique if it exists.
Proof. This is easily reduced to the one-dimensional case as follows. Define an abelian tube
domain T = exp(RXH +] − 1, 1[iXH) and set ∂s T = exp(RXH + iXH ). We realize T ⊆ ΞH
and ∂s T ⊆ G/H through the T -orbit , respectively ∂s T -orbit, through KC ∈ ΞH , respectively
zH ∈ G/H . Let f ∈ C(G/H) and assume that f has a holomorphic extension fe. Let ϕ = f |∂s T .
Then ϕ has a holomorphic extension to T given by ϕ  e = fe|T . By the well known one-dimensional
                  e ≡ 0 if ϕ ≡ 0 . Thus if f ≡ 0 , we obtain fe|T ≡ 0 . Replacing f by fg where
situation we have ϕ
fg (xH) = f (gxH) for g ∈ G, then the above discussion implies that fe|GT ≡ 0 and hence fe ≡ 0
as GT contains the totally real submanifold G/K of ΞH .
      We assume that the complex conjugation gC → gC , X 7→ X with respect to the real form
g of gC lifts to a conjugation g 7→ g of GC . Notice that this is always satisfied if GC is the
universal complexification of G. Notice also that x ∈ Ξ    e for all x ∈ Ξ.
                                                                         e Let u, v ∈ HK . Then the
functions
                              e ∋ x 7→ hπ 0 (x)u, vi, hu, π(x−1 )vi ∈ C
                              Ξ
are well defined and holomorphic by Theorem 2.1.2. Both of them agree if x ∈ G and hence they
                e.
agree on all of Ξ

Proposition 2.2.3.      Let (π, H) be a admissible K -spherical representation of G with finite
length. Let v ∈ Hω . Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) The matrix coefficient

                                 fv,vH : G/H → C, gH 7→ hπ(g −1 )v, vH i

     admits a holomorphic extension fev,vH . Moreover, we have

                                           fev,vH (xKC ) = hv, π 0 (x)vK i

      for all xKC ∈ ΞH .
 (ii) The matrix coefficient

                                  gvH ,v : G/H → C, gH 7→ hπ 0 (g)vH , vi

     admits a holomorphic extension e
                                    gvH ,v . Moreover, we have

                     gevH ,v (xKC ) = hπ 0 (x)vK , vi    and    gvH ,v (xKC ) = fev,vH (xKC )
                                                                e

     for all xKC ∈ ΞH .
Proof.    We will only show (i) as the proof for (ii) is the same. By Theorem 2.1.2 (i) it follows
that
                                          fe(xKC ) = hv, π 0 (x̄)vK i
exists and is holomorphic on ΞH . Let g ∈ G and 0 < t < 1 . Then

                       hπ(g −1 )v, π 0 (at )vK i = hv, π 0 (gat )vK i = fe(gat KC ) .

Taking the limit at t → 1 and using the remarks just before (2.1.4) it follows that

                                    lim fe(gat KC ) = hπ(g −1 )v, vH i
                                    tր1

and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets in G.

the function
                             G/H ∋ x 7→ gη,v (x) := hπ 0 (x)η, vi

has a holomorphic extension to ΞH for all v ∈ Hω . Notice that for g ∈ G and x ∈ ΞH we have

(2.2.2)                                             gη,v (g −1 x) .
                                     gη,π(g)v (x) = e
                                     e

Our next task is to prove a converse of Proposition 2.2.3, namely that the map

                                    HK ∋ vK 7→ vH ∈ (H−∞ )H
                                                          hol


is an isomorphism. In particular only the H -invariant distribution vectors constructed in Theo-
rem 2.1.3 have holomorphic extension. Thus if dim HK = 1 , as in the case of the principal series
representations of G, the space (H−∞ )H  hol is also one-dimensional, i.e., there is (up to scalar) a
unique H -spherical distribution vector which allows holomorphic extension of the smooth matrix
coefficients.
       As before we consider the pairing

             (H−∞ )H × H∞ → C ∞ (G/H), (η, v) 7→ gη,v ; gη,v (gH) = hπ 0 (g)η, vi .

Theorem 2.2.4.        Let (π, H) be an admissible representation of G with finite length. Then
the map
                                    HK ∋ vK 7→ vH ∈ (H−∞ )H
                                                          hol

is a linear isomorphism.
Proof.      It follows from Theorem 2.1.3 that HK ∋ vK 7→ vH ∈ (H−∞ )H     hol is well defined and
injective. It is also clear that the map is linear. It remains to show that the map is onto. For
that let η ∈ (H−∞ )H  hol . Define a conjugate linear map η
                                                          e : HK → C by

                                          ηe(u) = e
                                                  gη,u (KC ) .

Then it follows from (2.2.2) that ηe is K -invariant. Thus we find a unique vK ∈ HK such that
ηe(u) = hvK , ui for all u ∈ HK . In particular, it follows that

(2.2.3)                       (∀u ∈ HK )        geη,u (KC ) = gevH ,u (KC ) .

      Fix w ∈ HK . We claim that geη,w = gevH ,w . In fact, it follows from (2.2.2) and (2.2.3) that
all derivatives of geη,w and gevH ,w coincide at KC ∈ ΞH . Thus geη,w = gevH ,w by Taylor’s Theorem.
      It follows from our claim that gη,w = gvH ,w for all w ∈ HK . In particular, we obtain that

                    (∀w ∈ HK )       hη, wi = gη,w (H) = gvH ,w (H) = hvH , wi ,

and so η = vH , concluding the proof of the theorem.

Corollary 2.2.5.      (Multiplicity one) Let (π, H) be an irreducible K -spherical Hilbert
representation of G. Then dim(H−∞ )Hhol = 1 .
Proof. According to [H84, Ch. IV, Th. 4.5(iii)] we have that dim HK = 1 . Thus the assertion
follows from Theorem 2.2.4.

                   2.3. Distributional characters and boundary values
Denote by dg and dh Haar measures on G and H . Notice that both G and H are unimodular
and hence a left Haar measure is also a right Haar measure. Denote by dgH a invariant measure
on G/H , which we will normalize in a moment. Recall that the mapping
                                                               Z

                   Cc (G) → Cc (G/H), f 7→ f ; f (xH) =            f (xh) dh
                                                                       H
is continuous and onto. We will normalize the measure dgH in such a way that
                               Z             Z
                                  f (g) dg =     f H (gH) dgH
                                  G               G/H
holds for all f ∈ Cc (G).
      In this section (π, H) will denote a unitary admissible representation representation of G
with finite length. Further we will assume that HK 6= {0} . Notice that π unitary implies
π = π0 .
      For f ∈ Cc∞ (G) let us recall the mollifying property: π(f )H−∞ ⊆ H∞ . Thus the mapping
                             Θπ,vH : Cc∞ (G) → C, f 7→ hπ(f )vH , vH i .
is well defined. It is known that Θπ = Θπ,vH is a H -bi-invariant positive definite distribution on
G. The H -bi-invariance implies that Θπ (f ) does only depend on f H . We can therefore define
a H -invariant distribution on G/H , also denoted by Θπ , by
                                         Θπ (f H ) = Θπ (f ) .
      On the other hand we notice that π(x)vK ∈ Hω for all x ∈ G exp(iΩH )KC and hence
x 7→ hvH , π(x)vK i descends to a well defined and anti-holomorphic function on ΞH . Here vK and
vH correspond to each other according to Theorem 2.2.4. We can therefore define the holomorphic
function θπ = θπ,vH : ΞH → C by
                             θπ (xKC ) = hvH , π(x)vK i = hπ(x)vK , vH i .
Then θπ is left H -invariant.
     Our next aim is to show that Θπ is given by the limit operation and convolution:
                                         Z
                           Θπ (f ) = lim    f (gH) θπ (g −1 at ) dgH
                                      tր1   G/H
for suitable regular functions f .
       As we have only established the convergence π(at )vK → vH in H−ω and not in H−∞ , we
cannot work with test-functions but must use an appropriate space of analytic vectors. For that
let us write L1 (G)ω,ω for the space of analytic vectors for the left-right regular representation
of G × G on L1 (G). Notice that L1 (G)ω,ω is an algebra under convolution which is invariant
under the natural involution f 7→ f ∗ with f ∗ (x) = f (x−1 ). Its importance lies in the fact that
π(f )H−ω ⊆ Hω holds for all f ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω (cf. Proposition A.4.1 in the appendix).
       Write L1 (G/H)ω for the space of analytic vectors for the left regular representation of G
on L (G/H). According to Proposition A.3.2 below, the averaging map f 7→ f H maps L1 (G)ω,ω
     1

into L1 (G/H)ω . Finally let us define the space:
                        A1 (G/H) = {f H ∈ L1 (G/H)ω | f ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω } .
     From our discussion above we conclude that the mapping
                              Θω    1
                               π : L (G)
                                        ω,ω
                                            → C, f 7→ hπ(f )vH , vH i
is well defined and H bi-invariant. In particular Θω
                                                   π (f ) depends only on f
                                                                            H
                                                                              and therefore
             1                                                   ω
factors to A (G/H). We denote the corresponding map again by Θπ .

Proof. Let F ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω be such that f = F H . As π(F )vH ∈ Hω (cf. Proposition A.4.1), it
follows from Theorem 2.1.3 that

                                     Θω
                                      π (F ) = lim hπ(F )vH , π(at )vK i .

Thus:

                                         tր1    G


Fix 0 ≤ t < 1 . We claim that g 7→ θπ (g −1 at ) is a bounded function on G. Indeed, for g ∈ G
we have
                    |θπ (g −1 at )| = |hπ(g −1 at )vK , vK i| = |hπ(at )vK , π(g)vK i|

and our claim follows from kπ(at )vK k < ∞. Combining (2.3.1) with our claim then yields

completing the proof of the theorem.
        We finish this subsection by the following simple remark.

Lemma 2.3.2. Suppose that π is irreducible. Then Θπ is an eigendistribution of the algebra
D(G/H) of invariant differential operators on G/H .
Proof.   Recall the surjective homomorphisms U(gC )h → D(G/H) and U(gC )k → D(G/K).
We have xH HC xH = KC . Hence, Ad(x−1
         −1
                                    H
                                      ) defines an isomorphism

                                       Ad(x−1
                                           H ): U(gC )
                                                      h
                                                        → U(gC )k .

       In order to prove the lemma it is sufficient to show that vH is an eigenvector for each
dπ 0 (u), u ∈ U(gC )h .
       Notice that for each u                                     u) such that dπ 0 (e
                            e ∈ U(gC )k there exists a constant c(e                  u)vK = c(e
                                                                                              u)vH .
               h
For u ∈ U(gC ) we now obtain that

                                       = lim π 0 (at )(dπ 0 (Ad(a−1

                                       = lim π 0 (at )(dπ 0 (Ad(xH )−1 u)vK

                                       = c(Ad(x−1
                                               H )u)vH .

This completes the proof of the lemma.




                            2.4. Principal series representations
In this section we consider the case where π = πλ is a spherical principal series representation.
In particular we will be discuss the dependence of vH on the spectral parameter λ.
      Let us first recall some well known
                                     P     facts about the principal series representations. For
α ∈ Σ let mα = dim gα and ρ: = 21 α∈Σ+ mα α . Write M = ZK (a) and denote by κ: G → K
and a: G → A the projections onto K , resp. A, associated to the Iwasawa decomposition
G = N AK . Note that a and κ have unique holomorphic extension to Ξ    e also denoted by a and
κ (cf. (1.2.1) and [KS01a]). As we are assuming that G ⊆ GC with GC simply connected and
H = Gτ , we have M = ZH (A). In particular M ⊆ H ∩ K .
      Define a minimal parabolic subgroup of G by Pmin = M AN . For λ ∈ a∗C let

                Dλ = {f ∈ C ∞ (G): (∀g ∈ G)(∀man ∈ P ) f (mang) = aρ−λ f (g)} .

The group G acts on Dλ by right translation. Denote the corresponding representation by πλ∞ ,
                                       eλ the completion of Dλ in the norm corresponding to the
i.e., πλ∞ (g)f (x) = f (xg). Denote by H
inner product                                Z
                                      hf, gi =       f (k)g(k) dk .
                                                 K

Then πλ∞ extends to a representation πλ of G in Hλ . We refer to (H        eλ , πλ ) as the spherical
principal series representation of G with parameter λ. The principal series representations
      eλ ) are admissible and of finite length; they are irreducible for generic parameters λ and
(πλ , H
unitary if λ ∈ ia∗ . It is also well known that He ∞ = Dλ excusing our above notation π ∞ .
                                                   λ                                        λ
       The restriction map H   e λ ∋ f 7→ f | K ∈ L2 (K) is injective by the left N A-covariance
of f . Furthermore f | K is left M -invariant. Hence the restriction map defines an isometry
Heλ ֒→ L2 (M \K). On the other hand if F ∈ L2 (M \K) then we can define f ∈ H                 e λ by
f (nak) = a  ρ−λ                   e     2
                 F (M k). Hence Hλ ≃ L (M \K). In this realization we have

                              [πλ (g)f ](M k) = a(kg)ρ−λ f (M κ(kg)) .

Hence the Hilbert space is the same for all λ but the formula for the representation depends on λ.
Notice that for k ∈ K this simplifies to (πλ (k)f )(M x) = f (M xk). We write Hλ = L2 (M \K)
to indicate the role of L2 (M \K) as the representation space for πλ and call it the compact
realization of πλ . As a consequence of this discussion, we see that vK,λ = 1M\K is a normalized
K -fixed vector in Hλ and in fact HλK = CvK,λ . We write vH,λ and vHω,λ instead of vH and vHω
to indicate the dependence of λ.
      We have πλ0 = π−λ . Thus in the compact realization we have


(2.4.1)                           [πλ0 (at )vK,λ ](M k) = a(kat )ρ+λ
                                 Holomorphic    H -spherical distribution vectors                           17

for all 0 ≤ t < 1 and so

(2.4.2)            hvHω,λ , vi   = lim           a(kat )ρ+λ v(M k) dM k             (v ∈ Hλω ) .
                                   tր1   M\K


     In the sequel it will be importnat that Hλω = C ω (M \K) is independent of λ. The following
theorem specifies the dependence of vH,λ on λ:

Theorem 2.4.1.         The mapping
                                                 a
                                      a∗C →            (Hλ−∞ )H , λ 7→ vH,λ
                                                λ∈a∗
                                                   C



is weakly anti-holomorphic in the sense that for all v ∈ C ω (M \K) the mapping

                                              a∗C → C, λ 7→ hvH,λ , vi

is anti-holomorphic.
Proof. Let v ∈ C ω (M \K). It is convenient to consider v as an M -invariant function on K .
As v is analytic, there exists an open K × K -invariant neighborhood U of K in KC such that
v extends to a holomorphic M -invariant function ev on U .
      Let ε > 0 . Then it follows from the compactness of Kaε and (1.2) that we can choose
ε > 0 small enough such that κ(Kaε ) ⊆ U .
      Now consider v as an element of Hλω . We claim that πλ (aε )v exists. In fact, using our
introductory remarks, we have

                                  [πλ (aε )v](M k) = a(kaε )ρ−λ ve(κ(kaε )) .

      With (2.4.1) we now compute


                   hvH,λ , vi = hπλ (a1−ε )0 vK,λ , πλ (aε )vi
                                Z
(2.4.3)
                              =        a(ka1−ε )ρ+λ · a(kaε )ρ−λ · ve(κ(kaε )) dM k .
                                    M\K


By our remarks at the beginning of the proof, we have

(2.4.4)                                      supk∈K |e
                                                     v (κ(kaε ))| < ∞ .

Notice that (1.2) implies that both a(Ka1−ε ) and a(Kaε ) are compact subsets of T (Ω). Thus,
if C ⊆ a∗C is a compact subset, then


(2.4.5)   supλ∈C supk∈K |a(ka1−ε )ρ+λ | < ∞,                  and       supλ∈C supk∈K |a(kaε )ρ−λ | < ∞ .

Therefore, if we use the estimates (2.4.4) and (2.4.5), it follows from (2.4.3) that λ 7→ hvH,λ , vi
is anti-holomorphic.

               2.5. Integral representation and asymptotic behaviour of θπ
Previously we have defined a H -invariant holomorphic function θπ for unitary representations
π . For non-unitary π we define θπ by

                           θπ (xKC ) = hπ(x)vK , vH i       (xKC ∈ ΞH ) .
Clearly, θπ is a holomorphic function on ΞH . Moreover, if π is unitary, then θπ is H -invariant.
      In this subsection we will give an integral representation of the functions θπ for principal
series represntations π . This will also allow us to read off the asymptotic behaviour of θπ .
     Recall the definition of the spherical function ϕλ of parameter λ ∈ a∗C by
                                                   Z
                   ϕλ (g) = hπλ (g)vK,λ , vK,λ i =   a(kg)ρ−λ dk   (g ∈ G) .
                                                     K

      It follows from Theorem 2.1.2 that ϕλ admits a holomorphic extension to Ξe H (or ΞH if
we wish to consider ϕλ as a function on G/K ). Also ϕλ |A extends holomorphically to the tube
T (2Ω) = A exp(2iΩ). Notice that zH ∈ T (2Ω). All mentioned holomorphic extensions of ϕλ are
also denoted by ϕλ .
      In the sequel we abbreviate and write θλ instead of θπλ . The next result is immediate
from the definitions, Theorem 2.1.2 and the formula (2.4.1).

Theorem 2.5.1.      Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a principal series representation with parameter λ ∈ a∗C .
Then for all xKC ∈ ΞH we have
                                           Z
                          θλ (xKC ) = lim     a(kx)ρ−λ a(kat )ρ+λ dk
                                          tր1    K
                                      = lim ϕλ (at x) .
                                          tր1

Furthermore,
                                        θλ (aKC ) = ϕλ (xH a)
for all a ∈ T (Ω) = A exp(iΩ). Here ϕλ denotes the holomorphically extended spherical function
to T (2Ω).
Proof.    Let x ∈ ΞH . Then we have

                             θλ (x) = hπλ (x)vK , vH i
                                   = lim hπλ (x)vK , πλ0 (at )vK i
                                     tր1
                                         Z
                                   = lim     a(kx)ρ−λ a(kat )ρ+λ dk .
                                      tր1    K

But we can also write the third line as
                                 θλ (x) = lim hπλ (x)vK , πλ0 (at )vK i
                                            tր1

                                        = lim hπλ (at x)vK , vK i
                                            tր1

                                        = lim ϕλ (at x) .
                                            tր1

The last statement follows now from Theorem 2.1.2, part (ii).
                             Holomorphic   H -spherical distribution vectors                  19

      To discuss the asymptotic expansions of θλ along a positive Weyl chamber we first have
to recall some facts on the Harish-Chandra expansion of the spherical functions. For that let
a+ = {X ∈ a: (∀α ∈ Σ+ ) α(X) > 0} and set A+ = exp(a+ ). Further we define Λ = N0 [Σ+ ].
If µ ∈ Λ , then we define a meromorphic function Γµ (λ) in the parameter λ ∈ a∗C by Γ0 (λ) = 1
and then recursively by

                                  2     X     X
                  Γµ (λ) =                 mα   Γµ−2kα hµ + ρ − 2kα − λ, αi .
                             hµ, µ − λi  +
                                        α∈Σ         k∈N

We call λ ∈ a∗C
              generic if Γµ (·) is holomorphic at λ for all µ ∈ Λ . For generic λ ∈ a∗C we define
the Harish-Chandra Φ-function on A+ by
                                        X
                          Φλ (a) = aλ−ρ     Γµ (λ)a−µ      (a ∈ A+ ) .
                                              µ∈Λ


This series is locally absolutely convergent. In particular, we see that Φλ extends to a holomor-
phic function on A+ exp(2iΩ) ⊆ AC which we also denote by Φλ . Finally, with c(λ) the familiar
Harish-Chandra c-function on G/K , we have for all generic parameters λ ∈ a∗C that
                                        X
                             ϕλ (a) =         c(wλ)Φwλ (a)        (a ∈ A+ ) .
                                        w∈W

Combining these facts with Theorem 2.5.1 we now obtain that:

Theorem 2.5.2. Let λ ∈ a∗C be a generic parameter. Then the following assertions hold.
 (i) For a ∈ A+ exp(iΩ) we have
                                                    X
                        θλ (aKC ) = ϕλ (zH a) =           c(wλ)(zH a)wλ−ρ Φwλ (zH a) .
                                                    w∈W


 (ii) Suppose that hRe λ, αi > 0 for all α ∈ Σ+ . Fix Y ∈ a+ . Then

                               lim et(ρ−λ)(Y ) θλ (exp(tY )KC ) = c(λ) · zHλ−ρ .
                              t→∞




           2.6. H -orbit coefficients of the holomorphic distribution vector
As we have remarked already earlier the space (Hλ−∞ )H has dimension |W/W0 | for generic λ.
One can parametrize (Hλ−∞ )H through the open H -orbits in the flag manifold Pmin \G. These
orbits haven been parametrized by Rossmann and Matsuki (cf. [M79]); they are given by

                                    Pmin wH          (w ∈ W/W0 ) .

     For λ ∈ a∗C and w ∈ W/W0 define a right H -invariant function on G by
                                
                                    ρ+λ
                      ηλ,w (x) = a      for x = manwh ∈ M AN wH
                                  0     otherwise .
      For λ ∈ a∗ we will use the notation λ << 0 if hλ, αi << 0 for all α ∈ Σ+ . Then it is known
that for λ << 0 the functions ηλ,w are continuous and define H -fixed distribution vectors of πλ

[Ó87]. Moreover, the distributions ηλ,w admit continuation in λ to a weakly anti-meromorphic
function on a∗C . For generic λ ∈ a∗C we have
                                                 M
                                     (Hλ−∞ )H =       Cηλ,w
                                                    w∈W/W0

and the mapping                                                         X
                       jλ : C|W/W0 | → (Hλ−∞ )H , (cw )w 7→                    cw ηλ,w
                                                                     w∈W/W0

is a bijection for generic λ, weakly anti-meromorphic in λ [vdB88]. For λ << 0 the inverse of
jλ is given by the evaluation mapping

                            ev: (Hλ−∞ )H → C|W/W0 | , η 7→ (η(w))w .

       On the other hand we know that the weakly holomorphic distribution vector vH,λ depends
weakly anti-holomorphically on λ ∈ a∗C (cf. Theorem 2.4.1). The next theorem gives us the
coefficients of vH,λ in terms of the basis (ηλ,w ) of (Hλ−∞ )H . We note that for λ << 0 the
distribution vH,λ is given through the bounded measurable function


(2.6.1)                               vH,λ (k) = lim a(kat )ρ+λ .
                                                   tր1

Theorem 2.6.1.        For generic parameters λ ∈ a∗C we have
                                              X        w −1 (ρ+λ)
                                 vH,λ =             zH              · ηλ,w .
                                          w∈W/W0

Proof.    For λ ∈ a∗C generic write
                                                   X
                                      vH,λ =             cλ,w · ηλ,w
                                               w∈W/W0

for the basis expansion. As the coefficients cλ,w depend weakly anti-meromorphically on λ, it is
                                 w −1 (ρ+λ)
sufficient to show that cλ,w = zH             for λ << 0 . Then (2.6.1) implies that

                                                                               w −1 (ρ+λ)
                    cλ,w = vH (w) = lim vH,λ (wat ) = a(wzH )ρ+λ = zH                       ,
                                      tր1

as was to be shown.

Remark 2.6.2. Let us go back to Example 2.1.5 for G = Sl(2, R). Here W0 = {1} and
so W/W0 = {1, w} where w is the non-trivial element in the Weyl group which acts by
multiplication by −1 . The distributions vH,1 and vH,2 from Example 2.1.5 are given in the
above notation by

                               vH,1 = ηλ,1         and       vH,2 = ηλ,w .
In Example 2.1.5 we did show that
                                               π                    π
                            vH = vH,λ = ei 4 (1+λ) vH,1 + e−i 4 (1+λ) vH,2 ·

As zHρ+λ = ei 4 (1+λ) , we hence see that the above formula is a special case of Theorem 2.6.1.

                   2.7. Transformation under the intertwining matrix
For w ∈ W and λ ∈ a∗C generic we have an intertwining operator

                               A(λ, wλ): (πλ , Hλ∞ ) → (πwλ , Hwλ
                                                               ∞
                                                                  ).

Notice that the Hilbert space Hλ is independent of λ because we use the compact realzation. We
can therefore speak about meromorphic maps from a∗C into the space of bounded operators from
Hλ into Hµ . In this sense it is well known that the map a∗C ∋ λ 7→ A(λ, wλ) is meromorphic.
Dualizing, we obtain an anti-meromorphic family of intertwining operators
                                                 −∞
                                    A(λ, wλ)∗ : Hwλ → Hλ−∞ .

Restricting A(λ, wλ)∗ to the space of H -invariant distribution vectors we obtain a linear bijec-
tion, say

                                               −∞ H
                               AH (λ, wλ)∗ : (Hwλ ) → (Hλ−∞ )H .
Often one refers to A∗H (λ, wλ) as the intertwining matrix. In terms of the basic distribution
vectors (ηwλ,w′ )w′ respectively (ηλ,w′ )w′ the operator AH (λ, wλ)∗ has an unknown, seemingly
complicated expression. In this section we will show that the the intertwining matrix maps the
holomorphic distribution vector vH,wλ to a multiple of vH,λ . In order to describe this multiple
more precisely we need more notations.
      For w ∈ W define a subgroup of N = θ(N ) by

                                       N w = N ∩ wN w−1 .

For Re λ << 0 we define functions
                                               Z
                                    cw (λ) =         a(n)ρ−λ dn .
                                                Nw

If w = w0 is the longest element in W , then we write c(λ) instead of cw0 (λ) and remark that c(λ)
is the familiar Harish-Chandra c-function on G/K . The functions cw (λ) admit meromorphic
continuation to a∗C and can be explicitely computed (Gindikin-Karpelevic formula).
      With this notation the intertwinig operators A(λ, wλ) for λ << 0 are defined by
                                       Z
                     [A(λ, wλ)f ](x) =      f (nwx) dn      (f ∈ Dλ , x ∈ G) .
                                         Nw

Theorem 2.7.1.       Assume that λ ∈ a∗C is generic. Then

                                AH (λ, wλ)∗ vH,wλ = cw (λ) · vH,λ .

Proof.     It is well known - and follows immediately from the definition - that A(λ, wλ)vK ,λ =
cw (λ)vK,wλ . But then, as A(λ, wλ)∗ vK,wλ is K -invariant, we also get

                         hA(λ, wλ)∗ vK,wλ , vK,λ i = hvK,wλ , A(λ, wλ)vK ,λ i
                                                   = hvK,wλ , cw (λ)vK,wλ i
                                                   = cw (λ) .
22                        Simon Gindikin, Bernhard Krötz and Gestur Ólafsson

Noticing that cw (λ) = cw (λ) it follows that

                                  A(λ, wλ)∗ vK,wλ = cw (λ)vK,λ .

Finally, using that A(λ, wλ)∗ is an intertwining operator, we get for a K -finite u :

                    hA∗H (λ, wλ)vH,wλ , ui = hvH,wλ , A(λ, wλ)ui
                                                  0
                                          = lim hπwλ (at )vK,wλ , A(λ, wλ)ui
                                            tր1

                                          = lim hvK,wλ , πwλ (at )−1 A(λ, wλ)ui
                                            tր1

                                          = lim hvK,wλ , A(λ, wλ)πwλ (at )−1 ui
                                            tր1

                                          = lim hA(λ, wλ)∗ vK,wλ , πwλ (at )−1 ui
                                            tր1

                                          = cw (λ) lim hπλ (at )vK,λ , ui
                                                    tր1

                                          = cw (λ)hvH,λ , ui .

Hence AH (λ, wλ)∗ vH,wλ = cw (λ) · vH,λ , as was to be shown.




                        2.8. Relation to the horospherical picture
In this subsection we explain the construction of the holomorphic distribution vector vH from
the horospherical point of view.
      Let κ ∈ a∗C be a complex parameter. We call the holomorphic function

               ψeκ (nak) = aκ = exp(< κ, log a >),        n ∈ NC , a ∈ T (Ω), k ∈ KC

on Ξe (see (1.2.1)) the holomorphic horospherical function with parameter κ.
      This function can be pushed down to Ξ as a holomorphic locally NC -invariant function
ψκ . The function ψκ is a holomorphic extension of the usual horospherical (N -invariant, A-
homogeneous) function on G/K , corresponding to spherical principal representations related to
κ. For certain values of the parameter κ the function ψκ has boundary distribution values
ψκ,H on G/H . To understand the structure of those distributions, let us remark that a Zariski
open part of G/H is the disjoint union of domains Yj = N Ayj where y1 , · · · , yk correspond to
the vertices of ΩH (W -equivalent). On each Yj we have an N -invariant, A-homogeneous
distribution with parameter κ (such distributions on Yj are unique up to a multiplicative
constant).
      The function ψeκ can be also pushed down on a domain DH in NC MC \GC as a holomorphic
function ψκ . This function with parameters holomorphically extends K -invariant vectors in the
principal spherical representations on M N \G. The boundary values of this holomorphic function
give an H -invariant distribution, the domains Yj correspond to the H -orbits on M N \G and
we have the corresponding decomposition of ψκ .

        3. An application: Hardy spaces for NCC symmetric spaces
In this section we apply our theory developed in Section 2 to associate to every NCC symmetric
space G/H a Hardy space H2 (ΞH ). The Hardy space is a G-invariant Hilbert space of holomor-
phic functions on ΞH featuring a boundary value mapping which gives an isometric embedding
of H2 (ΞH ) into the most-continuous spectrum L2 (G/H)mc of L2 (G/H). Hence we give a re-
alization of a part of L2 (G/H)mc in a space of holomorphic function on ΞH , generalizing and
extending our previous results from [GKÓ01] to all NCC spaces.
      This section is organized as follows: After a brief digression on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic
functions on ΞH , we give an adhoc definition of the Hardy space through the spectral measure.
Then, after recalling the theory of the most-continuous spectrum, we will show that there is a
boundary value mapping embedding H2 (ΞH ) isometrically into L2 (G/H)mc .



                 3.1. G-invariant Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions on ΞH
In this section we briefly recall the abstract theory of G-invariant Hilbert spaces of holomorphic
functions, specialized to the complex manifold ΞH (see also [FT99] and [K99] for the general
theory).
      In the sequel we will consider O(ΞH ) as a Fréchet space with the topology of compact
convergence. We let G act on O(ΞH ) by the left regular representation L :
(3.1.1)                  (L(g)f )(z) = f (g −1 z)      (g ∈ G, f ∈ O(ΞH ), z ∈ ΞH ) .
By a G-invariant Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on ΞH we understand a Hilbert space
H ⊆ O(ΞH ) such that:
(IH1) The inclusion H ֒→ O(ΞH ) is continuous.
(IH2) The Hilbert space H is invariant under L and the the corresponding representation of G
      is unitary.
      It follows from (IH1) that for every z ∈ ΞH the point evaluation H → C, f →  7 f (z), is
continuous. Thus, there exists a Kz ∈ H such that hf, Kz i = f (z) holds for every f ∈ H . In
this way we obtain a function
                            K: ΞH × ΞH → C, (z, w) 7→ K(z, w) = hKw , Kz i .
The function K is holomorphic in the first variable and anti-holomorphic in the second variable.
It follows from (IH2) that K is G-invariant, i.e., K(gz, gw) = K(z, w) holds for all g ∈ G and
all z, w ∈ ΞH . We call K the Cauchy-Szegö kernel of H and note that H is determined by K .
      To describe the spectral resolution of K denote by G   bs the K -spherical unitary dual of
              b                  ∗
G. We view Gs as a subset of aC /W using the parametrization of the spherical principal series.
                            b s coincides with the topology induced from a∗ /W . Slightly abusing
Notice that the topology on G                                              C
                                                                                  b s . For λ ∈ G
our notation from Subsection 2.4, we denote by (πλ , Hλ ) a representative of λ ∈ G             bs
define the G-invariant kernel Kλ by
                     Kλ (xKC , yKC ) = hπλ (y)vK,λ , πλ (x)vK,λ i      (xKC , yKC ∈ ΞH ) .
Write     Ξopp
           H     for ΞH but endowed with the opposite complex structure. We recall that the map
                                      bs → O(ΞH × Ξopp ), λ 7→ Kλ
                                      G            H
24                             Simon Gindikin, Bernhard Krötz and Gestur Ólafsson

is continuous [KS01b, Sect. 5] (it follows from the fact that the spherical functions ϕλ and their
holomorphic continuations are continuous in λ). Then by [KS01b, Th. 5.1] there exists a unique
Borel measure µ on G b s such that

                                          Z
(3.1.2)                       K(z, w) =         Kλ (z, w) dµ(λ)           (z, w ∈ ΞH )
                                          bs
                                          G


with the right hand side converging absolutely on compact subsets of ΞH × ΞH . Equivalently
phrased, the mapping

                  Z   ⊕                                               Z                                    
(3.1.3)      Φ:           Hλ dµ(λ) → H, s = (sλ )λ 7→           xKC 7→           hπλ (x−1 )sλ , vK,λ i dµ(λ)
                  bs
                  G                                                         bs
                                                                            G


is a G-equivariant unitary isomorphism. In the sequel we refer to the measure µ as the Plancherel
measure of H .
      In [KS01b] a criterion was given on a Borel measure µ on G   bs to be a Plancherel measure
for an invariant Hilbert space H = H(µ) on Ξ. This criterion can be easily adapted to invariant
Hilbert spaces on ΞH . Let us provide the necessary modifications.
      Define a norm k · kH on a∗C by

                               kλkH : = supw∈W/W0 |λ(wXH )|                (λ ∈ a∗C ) .
Then [KS01b, Prop. 5.4] and its proof readily gives the following generalization:

Proposition 3.1.1.                                       b s with the property
                             Let µ be a Borel measure on G
                                                     Z
(3.1.4)                        (∀0 ≤ c < 2)                eck Im λkH dµ(λ) < ∞ .
                                                      bs
                                                      G


Then µ is the Plancherel measure of an invariant Hilbert space H(µ) on ΞH .




                               3.2. The definition of the Hardy space
We are now ready to give the definition of the Hardy space on ΞH . Let us denote by ia∗+ an
open Weyl chamber in ia∗ . In the sequel we will consider ia∗+ mainly as a subset of Gbs . Let
                         ∗
                                      P          −2w −1 λ
O be a neighborhood of ia such that w∈W/W0 zH             has a holomorphic square root zH (λ)
on O . Define a holomorphic function cG/H on O by

                                              cG/H (λ) = c(λ) · zH (λ)

and define a Borel measure µ on ia∗+ by

                                                                dλ
(3.2.1)                                        dµ(λ) =
                                                           | cG/H (λ)|2

where dλ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Then we have:
                              Holomorphic   H -spherical distribution vectors                25

Lemma 3.2.1. The measure µ satisfies the condition (3.1.4); in particular µ is the Plancherel
measure of an invariant Hilbert space H(µ) on ΞH .
Proof.    Recall the growth behaviour of the c -function on the imaginary axis: There exists
constants C, N > 0 such that
                                                     1
                                (∀λ ∈ ia∗ )               ≤ C(1 + |λ|N ) .
                                                 | c(λ)|2

Moreover for λ ∈ ia∗ one has zHλ = eλ(iXH ) > 0 . Hence
                                  X           −1
                                         |zH−w λ |2 ≥ e2kImλkH ·
                                    w∈W/W0


     Combining these two facts now yields that µ satisfies (3.1.4).
     Using Proposition 3.1.1 and Lemma 3.2.1 we now can give an adhoc-definition of the Hardy
space on ΞH .

Definition 3.2.2.     (Hardy space) Let G/H be a NCC symmetric space and ΞH its
associated domain in GC /KC . Then we define the Hardy space H2 (ΞH ) on ΞH by

                                              H2 (ΞH ) = H(µ)

with µ as in (3.2.1).
      Recall the Cauchy-Szegö kernel K(z, w) of the invariant Hilbert space H2 (ΞH ) from Sub-
section 3.1.

Lemma 3.2.3. Let K be the Cauchy-Szegö kernel of H2 (ΞH ). Then the limits

                                 Ψ(z) = lim K(z, at KC )         (z ∈ ΞH )
                                         tր1

exist locally uniformly. In particular, Ψ: ΞH → C is an H -invariant holomorphic function.
Proof.    Fix z ∈ ΞH and let U ⊆ ΞH be a compact neighborhood of z . Choose ε > 0 small
enough such that aε U ⊆ ΞH . Then, by G-invariance, we have

                          K(z, at KC ) = K(aε z, a−ε at KC ) = K(aε z, at−ε KC )

for all ε < t < 1 . The claim follows now, because ]ε, 1 + ε[∋ t 7→ K(aε z, at−ε KC ) ∈ C
is continuous, and hence limtր1 K(z, at KC ) = K(aε z, a1−ε KC ) exists and the convergence is
uniform on compact subsets.
     We refer to Ψ as the Cauchy-Szegö function of H2 (ΞH ). As K is G-invariant, it follows
that K can be reconstructed from Ψ . Moreover, as HC T (ΩH )KC /KC meets ΞH in an open set,
we conclude that Ψ is uniquely determined by its restriction to T (ΩH )KC /KC ⊆ ΞH .
     Using Theorem 2.5.2 (i) we finally obtain the spectral resolution of Ψ .

Theorem 3.2.4.          For a ∈ T (ΩH ) we have
                                            Z

                                 Ψ(aKC ) =      ϕλ (zH a)                   ,

where the integrals on the right hand side converge uniformly and absolutely on compact subsets
of T (ΩH ).

     We now discuss the boundary value map b: H2 (ΞH ) → L2 (G/H)mc . As usual, this
boundary value map can be nicely defined pointwise only on an appropriate dense subspace of
H2 (ΞH ). Write H2 (ΞH )ω for the analytic vectors of the left regular representation (L, H2 (ΞH )).
Fix f ∈ H2 (ΞH )ω . Then for every compact subset C ⊆ G there exists an 0 < ε < 1 such that
L(a−ε g −1 )f exists for all g ∈ G. In particular, if 0 < ε ≤ t < 1 , then

                        f (gat KC ) = f (gaε at−ε KC ) = [L(a−ε g −1 )f )](at−ε KC ) .

and so
                               lim f (gat KC ) = [L(a−ε g −1 )f )](a1−ε KC ) .
                               tր1

It follows that we have a well defined G-equivariant boundary value map:

               ω the corresponding formula for b on the space of sections with values in

       Hλ dµ(λ) , i.e., on the space of analytic sections. In this regard, it is better to replace
     +
H2 (ΞH )ω by some smaller but dense subspace H2 (ΞH )0 . In order to define H2 (ΞH )0 we have
                                                          R⊕
to introduce some terminology. For a section s = (sλ )λ ∈ ia∗ Hλ dµ(λ) we define its support
                                                                           +

by supp(s) = {λ ∈ ia∗+ : sλ 6= 0} . Futhermore we shall use the identifications Hλω = C ω (M \K)
for λ ∈ ia∗+ . Recall that if f ∈ H2 (ΞH )ω and s = (sλ )λ = Φ−1 (f ), then almost each stalk sλ is
an analytic vector, i.e. sλ ∈ C ω (M \K). The subspace H2 (ΞH )0 is then defined by
                                                                                        

                                            s: ia∗+ → C ω (M \K) is weakly smooth.

It is an easy verification that H2 (ΞH )0 is a dense subspace of H2 (ΞH ). Write b0 : H2 (ΞH )0 →
C(G/H) for the restriction of bω to H2 (ΞH )0 .
       In the sequel we will often identify a function f ∈ H2 (ΞH )0 with its corresponding section
s = (sλ ) = Φ−1 (f ). We then claim that

                                                                       Z                                      !

Notice that it is a priori not even clear that the right hand side of (3.2.3) is well defined. To
establish (3.2.3) fix f ∈ H2 (ΞH )0 and g ∈ G. As f is an analytic vector for the left regular
representation (L, H2 (ΞH )) it follows that there exists an 0 < ε < 1 such that L(aε g −1 )f
exists. Using standard procedures one deduces that πλ (aε g −1 )sλ exists for almost all λ. In
particular sλ ∈ Hλ is analytic for almost all λ. Furthermore, L(aε g −1 )f corresponds to the
section (πλ (aε g −1 )sλ )λ and so

      With the convention πλ (a1 )vK ,λ = vH ,λ we then have for all ε ≤ t ≤ 1 and almost all λ
the estimate
                   |hπλ (g −1 )sλ , πλ (at )vK,λ i| = |hπλ (aε g −1 )sλ , πλ (at−ε )vK,λ i|

with M = sup λ∈supp(s) kπλ (at−ε )vK,λ k < ∞ as supp(s) is compact.
                ε≤t≤1
      Recall our notion of holomorphic extension from Definition 2.2.1. As almost each stalk sλ
is an analytic vector in Hλ , it follows from estimates (3.2.4-5) and the compactness of supp(s)
that         Z                               Z

As f and g were arbitray, this completes the proof of (3.2.3).



                        3.3. The Plancherel Theorem for L2 (G/H)mc
Before we can show that b0 has image in L2 (G/H)mc and extends to an isometric embedding,
we need to recall some facts about the most continuous spectrum L2 (G/H)mc of L2 (G/H)
(cf. [vdBS97a] and [D98]). All the results collected below are proved in [vdBS97a] or might be
considered as special cases of [D98]. The crucial way where our assumption that G/H is NCC,
H = Gτ , and G ⊆ GC with GC simply connected, enters is the fact that ZH (a) = ZK (a) and
H = ZH (a)H0 .
      Recall from Subsection 2.7 the mapping j(λ): C|W/W0 | → (Hλ−∞ )H and the intertwining
                       −∞ H
matrix AH (λ, wλ)∗ : (Hwλ ) → (Hλ−∞ )H both defined for generic λ ∈ a∗C , and all w ∈ W . For
generic λ we define
                                  j 0 (λ): C|W/W0 | → (Hλ−∞ )H
by

(3.3.1)                           j 0 (λ): = [AH (w0 λ, λ)∗ ]−1 ◦ j(w0 λ)

with w0 ∈ W the longest element. Then j 0 has no poles on ia∗ (cf. [vdBS97b, Th. 1]). Denote
by (ew )w∈W/W0 the canonical basis of the Hilbert space C|W/W0 | . For w ∈ W/W0 define
                                      0
                                     ηλ,w : = j 0 (λ) ew ∈ (Hλ−∞ )H .

Define a Hilbert space structure on Hom(C|W/W0 | , Hλ ) using the identification

                              Hom(C|W/W0 | , Hλ ) ≃ Hλ ⊗ [C|W/W0 | ]∗ .

      Write S(G/H) for the Schwartz space on G/H and pmc : L2 (G/H) → L2 (G/H)mc for the
orthogonal projection on the most continuous spectrum. Set Smc (G/H) = pmc (S(G/H)). Then
for functions f ∈ Smc (G/H) the Fourier transform is defined by

Moreover [D98, Th. 3] implies that

(3.3.6)                                  F −1 (H0 ) ⊆ Smc (G/H) ;

in particular F (F −1 (s)) is given by the formula (3.3.2) for s ∈ H0 .

Remark 3.3.1. We have normalized the invariant measure on G/H and the measure dλ on
a∗ so that (3.3.3) and (3.3.4) holds without any additional constants. This is possible, because
we are only working with the principial series of representations and the most continuous part
of the spectrum. In general, one has to take into account the order of several Weyl groups. We
refer to Theorem 31 and Remark 32 in [vdB00] for general discussion on the normalization of
measures.

Proof.     For each λ ∈ ia∗+ define a vector b(λ) ∈ (C|W/W0 | )∗ by
                                             X      −w −1 (w0 λ+ρ) ∗
                            b(λ) = c(w0 λ)         zH             ew .
                                                             w∈W/W0

                          ∗
Notice, that for λ ∈ ia we have
                               −1                −w −1 (λ+ρ) −w −1 (λ+ρ)        −w −1 (λ+ρ) w −1 (λ̄+ρ)

Therefore, employing the Maass-Selberg relation for c(λ) we obtain
                                          X           −1

In particular we see that we have an G-equivariant isometric embedding of direct integrals

From the definition of the spaces H2 (ΞH )0 and H0 it is then clear that

we get by (3.2.3), (3.3.5), Theorem 2.6.1 and Theorem 2.7.1 that

                                         = b0 (s)(gH)

     From this and (3.3.6) it follows that b0 (f ) ∈ Smc (G/H); in particular we have b0 (f ) ∈
L2 (G/H)mc . Finally,
                    kb0 (f )kL2 (G/H)mc = kF −1 (ι(s))k = kι(s)k = ksk = kΦ(s)k = kf k
as F , ι and Φ are isometric. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Remark 3.4.2. The domain ΞH is maximal in the sense that generic functions in H2 (ΞH ) do
not extend holomorphically over ΞH .

                 3.5. Concluding remarks and the example of G = Sl(2, R)

 In [GKÓ01] we defined a Hardy space H2 (Ξ) on Ξ for the cases where Ξ = ΞH . Let us briefly
 summarize its construction in order to put it into perspective with the results in this section.
       Geometrically the situation Ξ = ΞH is equivalent to the fact that Ξ is homogeneous for a
 bigger Hermitian group S ⊇ G (cf. [KS01b]). More precisely, if U < S denotes an appropriate
 maximal compact subgroup with K ⊆ U then Ξ is G-biholomorphic to the Hermitian symmetric
 space S/U . For example if G is Hermitian, then S = G × G and Ξ ≃ G/K × G/K .
       The assumption Ξ = ΞH thus allows us to identify Ξ with a bounded symmetric domain
 D ≃ S/U . Within this identification one shows that ∂d Ξ ≃ G/H becomes a Zariski-open subset
 in the Shilov boundary ∂s D of D .
       The identification of Ξ with D was used in [GKÓ01] in a crucial way: One can transfer
 the action of an appropriate compression-semigroup Γ ⊇ G on D to Ξ and use this to give a
 definition of a Hardy space as follows:

                                                              Z
 (3.5.1)        H2 (Ξ) = {f ∈ O(Ξ): kf k2 = supγ∈int Γ                |f (γgzH)|2 dgH < ∞} .
                                                                G/H


 In [GKÓ01] we have shown – with entirely different methods – that the Hardy space defined as
 in (3.5.1) has the following properties:

(3.5.2) H2 (Ξ) is a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions featuring an isometric boundary value
        mapping b: H2 (Ξ) ֒→ L2 (G/H)mc . Moreover, im b is a multiplicity one subspace of full
        spectrum.
(3.5.3) The Hardy space H2 (Ξ) is G-isometric to L2 (G/K) through a transform of Segal-Barg-
        mann type.
(3.5.4) H2 (Ξ) is G-isometric to the classical Hardy space H2 (D) through an explicitely given
        mapping.

       In particular for Ξ = ΞH it follows from Theorem 3.4.1 and (3.5.2) that the definition of
 (3.5.1) coincides with our spectral definition of the Hardy space in Definition 3.2.2. For the cases
 where Ξ 6= ΞH there is no apparent semigroup action on ΞH and a definition of H2 (ΞH ) in the
 flavour of (3.5.1) seems presently not possible.
       Notice that (3.5.3) implies that the Plancherel measure of H2 (Ξ) has support equal to ia∗+ .
 However, in [GKÓ01] we could not determine this measure explicitely. With the new approach
 given in this section this difficulty is already taken care of with the definition of the Hardy space.
       The explicit isomorphism of H2 (Ξ) with the classical Hardy space H2 (D) allows us to
 find also a nice closed expression for the Cauchy-Szegö function Ψ (cf. [GKÓ01, Th. 5.7 and
 Ex. 5.10]). Combining this closed expression with the spectral resolution of Ψ in Theorem 3.2.4
 one obtains interesting identities for (generalized) hypergeometric functions. For example for
 G = Sl(2, R) one obtains the following formula:

             A. Appendix: Analytic vectors for representations

       In this appendix we will summarize some facts on analytic vectors for representations. None
of the results collected below is new, however some of them might be hard to find explicitely in
the literature. In order to keep the exposition short, we will omit proofs and often do not make
the most general assumptions. A more detailed account containing complete proofs can be found
in the forthcoming survey [KÓ03].



                    A.1. Definition and topology of analytic vectors
      Throughout this appendix G will denote a connected unimodular Lie group with G ⊆ GC .
      Let E be a complex Banach space and Gl(E) the group of continuous invertible operators
on E . By a (Banach) representation of (π, E) of G we will understand a group homomorphism
π: G → Gl(E) such that for all v ∈ E the orbit mapping

                                     γv : G → E, g 7→ π(g)v

is continuous.
      A vector v ∈ E is called analytic if γv is an analytic E -valued map or, equivalently, if
there exists an open neighborhood U of 1 in GC and a G-equivariant holomorphic mapping

                                           γv,U : GU → E

such that γv,U (1) = v . In particular, γv,U |G = γv .
      The vector space of all analytic vectors for (π, E) is denoted by E ω . We recall a funda-
mental result of Nelson which states that E ω is dense in E .
     Next we are going to recall the definition of the topology on E ω .
     For a complex manifold M let us denote by O(M, E) the space of all E -valued holomorphic
mappings on E . Topologically we consider O(M, E) as a Fréchet space with the topology of
compact convergence.
     For any open neighborhood U of 1 in GC we write EU for the subspace of E ω for which
γv,U exists. Then we obtain a linear embedding

                                ηU : EU → O(GU, E), v 7→ γv,U .
The image of ηU is closed and hence O(GU, E) induces a Fréchet topology on EU . Notice that
for U1 ⊆ U2 we obtain a continuous embedding EU2 → EU1 via restriction. Thus
                                                           [
                                    E ω = lim EU =              EU
                                            U→{1}
                                                            U

and we can equip E ω with the inductive limit topology, i.e. the finest topology on E ω for which
all inclusion mappings EU → E ω become continuous. Notice that this turns E ω into a locally
convex topological vector space.
       By E −ω we will denote the antidual of E ω , i.e. the space of all antilinear continuous
functionals on E ω . The space E −ω is referred to as the space of hyperfunction vectors of the
representation (π, E). We equip E −ω with the topology of bounded convergence.

                             A.2. Analytic vectors for L1 (G/H)
       Let H < G be a closed subgroup such that G/H carries a G-invariant measure. We write
L1 (G/H) for the corresponding Banach space of integrable functions and (L, L1 (G/H)) for the
left regular representation of G on L1 (G/H), i.e.,
                    (L(g)f )(xH) = f (g −1 xH)        (g, x ∈ G, f ∈ L1 (G/H)) .
     Further it is convenient to assume that G/H ⊆ GC /HC . Then we have the following
characterization of the analytic vectors:

Proposition A.2.1.        Let U be an open neighborhood of 1 in GC . Then f ∈ L1 (G/H)U if
and only if there exists a holomorphic function fe on the open set
                                     U −1 GHC /HC ⊆ GC /HC
with the following properties:
 (1) fe|G/H = f .
 (2) For all x ∈ U the map
                                    fex : G/H → C, gH 7→ fe(x−1 gH)
     belongs to L1 (G/H).
 (3) For all compact subsets U c ⊆ U we have
                                           supx∈U c kfex k < ∞ .


      There are two types of homogeneous spaces G/H which will be of particular interest for us.
The first is when H = 1. Then L1 (G)ω denotes the analytic for the left regular representation
of G on L1 (G). The second case is for G = H × H and H < G the diagonal subgroup. In this
case G/H ≃ H and L becomes left-right regular representation of H × H on H . Here we shall
write L1 (H)ω,ω for the analytic vectors.



                                  A.3. Averaging properties
     Recall that the average map
                                                                    Z
                     Cc (G) → Cc (G/H), f 7→ f H ; f H (xH) =               f (xh) dh
                                                                        H
is contiunuous and onto. Further, this map extends to a surjective contraction of Banach spaces
L1 (G) → L1 (G/H). We will show that the averaging operator maps analytic vectors into analytic
vectors.
      A standard application of the Bergman estimate gives:

Lemma A.3.1. Let U ⊆ GC be an open neighborhood of 1. Then for any pair of compact
subsets U1 , U2 ⊆ U with U1 ⊆ int U2 there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all f ∈ L1 (G)U
we have that                             Z
                              −1
                       (∀x ∈ U1 G)          |fe(xh)| dh ≤ C supx∈U2 kfex k,
                                            H

where fe denotes the extension of f to a holomorphic function on U −1 G (cf. Proposition A.2.1).
     Combining Lemma A.3.1 with Proposition A.2.1 we obtain:

Proposition A.3.2. Let U ⊆ GRC be an open neighborhood of 1. Then for every f ∈ L1 (G)U
and g ∈ G the integral f H (g) = H f (gh) dh converges absolutely and f H ∈ L1 (G/H)U . In
particular, there is a well defined mapping

                                 L1 (G)ω → L1 (G/H)ω , f 7→ f H .




                                   A.4. Mollifying properties
     In this section E = H will be a Hilbert space and (π, H) a unitary representation of G.
For f ∈ L1 (G) one defines a continuous operator π(f ): H → H by
                                     Z
                            π(f )v =    f (g)π(g)v dg     (v ∈ H) .
                                          G

Notice that this defines a ∗ -representation of the Banach algebra L1 (G), i.e. we have π(f ∗ g) =
π(f )π(g) and π(f )∗ = π(f ∗ ) with f ∗ (x) = f (x−1 ).
      Recall that L1 (G)ω,ω denotes the analytic vectors for the left-right regular representation
of G × G on L1 (G). It is easy to see that L1 (G)ω,ω is ∗ -closed subalgebra of L1 (G).
      Let f ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω . It follows readily from Proposition A.2.1 and the definition of analytic
vectors that π ω (f ) maps H continuously into Hω . In particular the restriction π ω (f ): = π(f ) |Hω
gives rise to a continuos operator π ω (f ): Hω → Hω . Hence we have an algebra representation:

                             π ω : L1 (G)ω,ω → End(Hω ), f 7→ π ω (f ) .
The corresponding dual representation is given by

                      π −ω : L1 (G)ω,ω → End(H−ω ); π −ω (f )λ = λ ◦ π ω (f ∗ ) .
Another application of Proposition A.2.1 then gives us the mollifying property:

Proposition A.4.1.      Let (π, H) be a unitary representation of a unimodular Lie group G.
Then we have for all f ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω that

                                          π −ω (f )H−ω ⊆ Hω .



Note: For f ∈ L1 (G)ω,ω , it is often convenient to write π(f ) instead of π −ω (f ). We will use
this convention throughout Section 2 in the main text.
