                                                        Abstract. The purpose of this note is to give explicit criteria to determine whether a real generalized Cartan

                                                        matrix is of finite type, affine type or of hyperbolic type by considering the principal minors and the inverse

                                                        of the matrix. In particular, it will be shown that a real generalized Cartan matrix is of finite type if and

                                                        only if it is invertible and the inverse is a positive matrix. A real generalized Cartan matrix is of hyperbolic

                                                        type if and only if it is invertible and the inverse is non-positive.

                                               For any complex n × n matrix A, one can associate with it a complex Lie algebra g(A), see [1] or [5]. The
                                             properties of A determine the structure of the Lie algebra g(A). In [1], some results are given for generalized
                                             Cartan matrices which are integral matrices. In particular, it was proved in [1] that any generalized Cartan
                                             matrix of finite type or affine type is symmetrizable. However, for any real generalized Cartan matrix, this
                                             is not true any more, see the example in the next section. Hence, we need to develop a new approach to
                                             deal with real generalized Cartan matrices. In this paper, we generalize some results in [1] to arbitrary real
                                             generalized Cartan matrices. Moreover, we give some give explicit criteria to judge whether a real generalized
                                             Cartan matrix is of finite type or of hyperbolic type. In particular, it will be proved that a real generalized
                                             Cartan matrix is of finite type if and only if it is invertible and the inverse is a positive matrix. A generalized
                                             Cartan matrix is of hyperbolic type if and only if it is invertible and the inverse is non-positive. Furthermore,
                                             we obtain a similar result for real generalized Cartan matrices of affine type. Some of the results are even
                                             new for generalized Cartan matrices.

                                      2. Vinberg’s classification theorem




    The main tool of the paper is Vinberg’s classification theorem. A matrix A is called decomposable if, after
reordering the indices (i.e. a permutation of its rows and the same permutation of its columns), A decomposes
into a non-trivial direct sum. A matrix that is not decomposable will be called indecomposable.
    Let u = (u1 , u2 , · · · , un )T be a real column vector. We write u > 0 if ui > 0 for all i, and u ≥ 0 if ui ≥ 0
for all i.


Definition 2.1. Let A = (aij )n×n ∈ Mn (R). The matrix A is called a real generalized Cartan matrix if it
satisfies the following properties:

     (1) A is indecomposable,
     (2) aij ≤ 0 for i 6= j,
     (3) aij = 0 if and only if aji = 0.


    The following lemma was proved in [1].


Lemma 2.2. Let A be a real generalized cartan matrix and let u ≥ 0 be a real column vector. Then Au ≥ 0
implies that either u > 0 or u = 0.


    The following theorem is known as Vinberg’s classification theorem see [1], [4].


Theorem 2.3. Let A be a real generalized Cartan matrix. Then one and only one of the following possibilities
holds for both A and AT .

     (1) detA 6= 0; there exists u > 0 such that Au > 0; Av ≥ 0 implies v > 0 or v = 0. In this case, A is
         called of finite type.
     (2) detA = 0; there exists u > 0 such that Au = 0; Av ≥ 0 implies Av = 0. In this case, A is called of
         affine type.
     (3) There exists u > 0 such that Au < 0; Av ≥ 0, v ≥ 0 imply v = 0. In this case, A is called of indefinite
         type.


    It is easy to see that Vinberg’s classification theorem can be simplified as follows.


Corollary 2.4. Let A be a n × n real generalized Cartan matrix. Then

     (1) A is of finite type if and only if there exists u ∈ Rn , u > 0 such that Au > 0.
     (2) A is of affine type if and only if there exists u ∈ Rn , u > 0 such that Au = 0.
     (3) A is of indefinite type if and only if there exists u ∈ Rn , u > 0 such that Au < 0.

                                                     1     1

Hence, A is of finite type. Clearly, A is non-symmetrizable.


                                               3. the main results




  Denote by I the n × n identity matrix.

Theorem 3.1. For any real generalized Cartan matrix A, there exists a unique real number d ∈ R such that
A + dI is of affine type. Furthermore, A + bI is of finite type if b > d and A + bI is of indefinite type if b < d.

Proof. Let
                                    If in (A) = {a ∈ R|A + aI is of finite type },

                                   Iaf f (A) = {a ∈ R|A + aI is of affine type },

                                  Iind (A) = {a ∈ R|A + aI is of indefinite type }.

  By Vinberg’s classification theorem, we have


                                                       ˙ af f (A)∪I
                                          R = If in (A)∪I        ˙ ind (A).

  If a ∈ If in (A) and b ≥ a, there exists u > 0 such that (A + aI)u > 0. Hence, (A + bI)u > 0 and so
b ∈ If in (A). For this given real number a, we can find a sufficient small ǫ > 0 such that (A + (a − ǫ)I)u > 0.
Hence, a − ǫ ∈ If in (A) and If in (A) is an open set. Similarly, if a ∈ Iind (A) and b ≤ a, then there exists u > 0
such that (A + aI)u < 0, then (A + bI)u < 0 and so b ∈ Iind (A). For this given real number a, we can find a
sufficient small ǫ > 0 such that (A + (a + ǫ)I)u < 0. Hence, a + ǫ ∈ Iind (A) and Iind (A) is an open set.
  If a ∈ Iaf f , then −a is a real eigenvalue of the matrix A. Hence, Iaf f (A) is a finite set. Since If in (A) and
Iind (A) are open sets, Iaf f (A) is non-empty. Assume that a1 , a2 ∈ Iaf f (A) and a1 < a2 . Then there exists b,
a1 < b < a2 , such that A + bI is of finite type or indefinite type. In either cases, it is a contradiction. Hence,
Iaf f (A) only contains one element, say d. Moreover,

                                             If in (A) = {a ∈ R|a > d}

and
                                             Iind (A) = {a ∈ R|a < d}.

    The following lemma was proved in [1].

Lemma 3.2. Let A be a real generalized Cartan matrix. If A is of finite or affine type, then any proper
principal submatrix decomposes into a direct sum of matrices of finite type.

Theorem 3.3. The real generalized Cartan matrix A is of finite type if and only if detA 6= 0 and A−1 > 0.

Proof. Let A be a real generalized Cartan matrix of finite type. Then detA 6= 0 by Vinberg’s theorem. Let
A−1 = (u1 , u2 , · · · , un ) where ui ’s are the column vectors of A−1 . Then Aui ≥ 0 for all i. Again by Vinberg’s
theorem, we have ui > 0 for all i, i.e. A−1 > 0.
    Conversely, assume that A is a generalized Cartan matrix such that detA 6= 0 and A−1 > 0. Of course, A
is not of affine type. If A is of indefinite type, then there exists u > 0 such that Au = w < 0. Since A−1 > 0,
we have u = A−1 w < 0 which is a contradiction. Therefore, A is of finite type.                                   

Definition 3.4. A real generalized Cartan matrix A is called a matrix of hyperbolic type if it is of indefinite
type and any proper principal submatrix of A is a direct sum of matrices of finite type or affine type. A
hyperbolic generalized Cartan matrix A is called strictly hyperbolic if any proper principal submatrix of A is
a direct sum of matrices of finite type.

Theorem 3.5. Let A be a real generalized Cartan matrix. Then A is of hyperbolic type if and only if for any
column vector u ∈ Rn , Au ≤ 0 implies u ≥ 0.

Proof. Let A be a generalized Cartan matrix of hyperbolic type. Let 0 6= u ∈ Rn such that Au ≤ 0. We claim
that u ≥ 0. If u is not non-negative, then u has both positive and negative entries since u ≤ 0 contradicts to
that A is of indefinite type. By reordering, we may assume that

                              u1 > 0, · · · , us−1 > 0, us ≤ 0, · · · , un−1 ≤ 0, un < 0.

We divide A into block form

                                                                    
                                                           A1   A2
                                                 A=                 
                                                           A3   A4
where A1 is a (s − 1) × (s − 1) submatrix, A2 is a (s − 1) × (n − s + 1) submatrix, A3 is a (n − s + 1) × (s − 1)
submatrix and A4 is a (n−s+1)×(n−s+1) submatrix. Let u′ = (u1 , · · · , us−1 )T and let w′ = (us , · · · , un )T .
Then we have


                                                 A1 u′ + A2 w′ ≤ 0.

Hence, A1 u′ ≤ −A2 w′ ≤ 0. Since A1 is a direct sum of matrices of finite type or affine type, we conclude
that A1 is of affine type and so s = n and A2 un = 0. Therefore, A2 = 0 and so A3 = 0 which contradicts to
that A is indecomposable. Hence, u ≥ 0.

  If A is of indefinite type but is not of hyperbolic type, then A has a (n − 1) × (n − 1) principal submatrix
A1 which is of indefinite type. We may assume that

Then we have Aw < 0 for sufficient large a. Contradiction!                                                  


Theorem 3.6. Let A be a real generalized Cartan matrix. Then A is of hyperbolic type if and only if detA 6= 0
and A−1 ≤ 0.


Proof. Assume that A is of hyperbolic type. If detA = 0, then there exist 0 6= u ∈ Rn such that Au =
A(−u) = 0. By Theorem 3.5, u ≥ 0 and −u ≥ 0 which force u = 0. Hence, A is nondegenerate. Assume that


                                             A−1 = (u1 , u2 , · · · , un ),


where u1 , u2 , · · · , un ∈ Rn . Then Aui ≥ 0 for all i. By theorem 3.5, ui ≤ 0.
  Conversely, assume that detA 6= 0 and A−1 ≤ 0. Let u ∈ Rn be such that Au = w ≥ 0. Then u = A−1 w ≤
0. Again by Theorem 3.5, A is of hyperbolic type.                                                           


Theorem 3.7. The real generalized Cartan matrix A is of finite type if and only if all of the principal minors
of A are positive. The real generalized Cartan matrix A is of affine type if and only if detA = 0 and all of
the principal minors with size ≤ n − 1 are positive.


Proof. Let B be an arbitrary real generalized Cartan matrix of finite type. Then for any a ≥ 0, B + aI is also
of finite type. Hence, det(B + aI) 6= 0 which means the real eigenvalues (if there are any) of B are positive.
Therefore, detB > 0.
  Now assume that A = (aij )n×n is a generalized Cartan matrix and that all of the principal minors of A
are positive. We then use induction on n to show that the matrix A is of finite type. The case n = 1 is
trivial. If A is not of finite type, then A must be of indefinite type because A can not be of affine type. By
the induction hypothesis, any principal indecomposable submatrix is of finite type. Hence, A is of strictly
hyperbolic type. Therefore, A−1 ≤ 0. But the (1, 1)-entry of A−1 is a (n − 1) × (n − 1) principal minor of A
over detA which means that detA < 0. Contradiction! Hence, A must be of finite type.
  If A is of affine type, then any proper principal submatrix of A is a direct sum of matrices of finite type.
Hence, the determinant of the proper principal matrix is positive.

    Conversely, assume that detA = 0 and all of the principal minors with size ≤ (n − 1) are all positive.
Clearly, A is not of finite type. If A is of indefinite type, then A must be of strictly hyperbolic type, and so
detA 6= 0 which is a contradiction. Therefore, A is of affine type.                                                                  

Remark 3.8. If a real generalized Cartan matrix A is of finite type (resp. affine type) and is symmetrizable,
then it is easy to see that there exist positive real numbers d1 , d2 , · · · , dn (see [1] 2.3) and a symmetric matrix
B such that
                                                   A = diag(d1 , d2 , · · · , dn )B.

From the above theorem, one can see that B is positive definite (resp. semi positive definite).

Corollary 3.9. Let A be a RGCM of hyperbolic type. Then detA < 0.

Proof. We already proved that detA < 0 if A is of strictly hyperbolic type. Assume that A is of hyperbolic
type. For a sufficient small ǫ > 0, A + ǫI is still of indefinite type. However, any principle indecomposable
submatrix is of finite type. Hence, det(A + ǫI) < 0. Note that detA 6= 0. Let ǫ tend to zero. Then
detA < 0.                                                                                                                            
