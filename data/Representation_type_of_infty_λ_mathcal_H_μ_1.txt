                                                      For a semi-simple finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra g we classify the rep-

                                                                                                                              λ Hµ of
                                                  Harish-Chandra bimodules for g.


                                             1    The result
                                             Let g be a simple finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra with a fixed triangular decopo-
                                             sition, g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ , let λ and µ be two dominant and integral (but not necessarily
                                             regular) weights, let U(g) be the universal enveloping algebra of g, and let Z(g) be the
                                             center of U(g). Denote by χλ and χµ the central characters of the Verma modules ∆(λ)
                                             and ∆(µ) respectively. Let further ∞λ Hµ1 denote the full subcategory of the category of
                                             all U(g)-bimodules, which consists of all X satisfying the following conditions (see [23,
                                             Kapitel 6]):

                                             (1) X is finitely generated as a bimodule;

                                             (2) X is algebraic, that is X is a direct sum of finite-dimensional g-modules with respect
                                                 to the diagonal action g 7→ (g, σ(g)), where σ is the Chevalley involution on g;

                                             (3) x(z − χµ (z)) = 0 for all x ∈ X and z ∈ Z(g);

                                             (4) for every x ∈ X and z ∈ Z(g) there exists k ∈ N such that (z − χλ (z))k x = 0.

                                             For regular µ the category ∞λ Hµ1 is equivalent to a block of the BGG category O, associated
                                             with the triangular decomposition above, see [6]. For singular µ the category ∞λ Hµ1 is
                                             equivalent to a block of the parabolic generalization O(p, Λ) of O, studied in [20]. Moreover,
                                             from [20, 28] it follows that every block of O and O(p, Λ) is equivalent to some ∞λ Hµ1 .
                                             Every ∞λ Hµ1 is equivalent to the module category of a properly stratified finite-dimensional
                                             associative algebra. The regular blocks of ∞λ Hµ1 can be used to categorify a parabolic Hecke
                                             module, see [25].
                                                 Let W be the Weyl group of g and ρ be the half of the sum of all positive roots of g.
                                             Then W acts on h∗ in the usual way and we recall the following dot-action of W on h∗ :
                                             w · ν = w(ν + ρ) − ρ. Let G ⊂ W be the stabilizer of λ with respect to the dot-action,

                                                                                           1
and H ⊂ W be the stabilizer of µ with respect to the dot-action. We will say that the
triple (W, G, H) is associated to ∞λ Hµ1 . In the present paper we classify the categories ∞λ Hµ1
according to their representation type in terms of the associated triples, thus extending the
results of [21, 10, 22]. Let (W, G, H) be the triple, associated to ∞λ Hµ1 , and (W, G′, H′ )
be the triple, associated to some ∞    1
                                   λ′ Hµ′ . Then from [5, Theorem 5.9] and [28, Theorem 11]
                 ∞ 1       ∞ 1
it follows that λ Hµ and λ′ Hµ′ are equivalent if there exists an automorphism, ϕ, of the
Coxeter system (W, S), where S is the set of simple reflections associated to our triangular
decomposition, such that ϕ(G) = G′ and ϕ(H) = H′ . By the Coxeter type of a triple,
(W, G, H), we mean the triple that consists of the Coxeter types of the corresponding
components of (W, G, H). Note that, in general, the Coxeter type of the triple does not
determine the triple in a unique way (for example, one can compare the cases (1e), (2d) and
(2e) in the formulation of Theorem 1.1 below). Our main result is the following statement:
                                          ∞ 1
Theorem 1.1. (1) The category             λ Hµ    is of finite type if and only if the Coxeter type of
   the associated triple is

    (a) any and W = G;
    (b) (An , An−1 , An ), (Bn , Bn−1 , Bn ), (Cn , Cn−1 , Cn ), or (G2 , A1 , G2 );
    (c) (A1 , e, e);
    (d) (An , An−1 , An−1 );
    (e) (An , An−1 , An−2 ), where An−2 is obtained from An by taking away the first and the
        last roots;
    (f ) (B2 , A1 , A1 ) or (C2 , A1 , A1 ), and G = H (in both cases);
    (g) (Bn , Bn−1 , Bn−1 ) or (Cn , Cn−1, Cn−1 ), where n ≥ 3;
    (h) (A2 , A1 , e).
                       ∞ 1
(2) The category       λ Hµ   is tame if and only if the Coxeter type of the associated triple is

    (a) (A3 , A1 ×A1 , A3 ), (A2 , e, A2 ), (B2 , e, B2 ), (G2 , e, G2 ), (B3 , A2 , B3 ), (C3 , A2 , C3 ), or
        (Dn , Dn−1 , Dn ) where n ≥ 4;
    (b) (B2 , A1 , A1 ) or (C2 , A1 , A1 ), and G 6= H (in both cases);
    (c) (An , An−1 , A1 × An−2 ), n > 2;
    (d) (An , An−1 , An−2 ), n > 2, where An−2 is included into An−1 and contains either the
        first or the last root of An ;
    (e) (An , An−1 , An−2 ), n > 2, where An−2 is not included into An−1 ;
    (f ) (A3 , A2 , e), (B2 , A1 , e), (C2 , A1 , e).
                                           ∞ 1

    For regular µ Theorem 1.1 gives the classification of the representation type of the
blocks of the category O obtained in [21] (see also [10] for a different proof). Formally, we
do not use any results from [21] and [10], however, the main idea of our proof is similar to
the one of [10].
    In the case H = W (i.e. µ is most singular) Theorem 1.1 reduces to the classification of
the representation type for the algebra C(W, G) of G-invariants in the coinvariant algebra
associated to W. This result was obtained in [22] and, in fact, our argument in the present
paper is based upon it.
    The last important ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.1, the latter being presented
in Section 3, is the classification of the representation type of all centralizer subalgebras in
the Auslander algebra An of k[x]/(xn ). This classification is given in Section 2. Two series
of centralizer subalgebras, namely those considered in Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.8, seem
to be rather interesting and non-trivial.
    The paper finishes with an extension of Theorem 1.1 to the case of a semi-simple Lie
algebra g. This is presented in Section 4, where one more interesting tame algebra arises.
    We would like to finish the introduction with a remark that just recently a first step to-
wards the classification of the representation type of the blocks of Rocha-Caridi’s parabolic
analogue OS of O was made in [7]. The next step would be to complete this classification
and then to classify the representation type of the “mixed” version of OS and O(p, Λ). As
the results of [7] and of the present paper suggest, this might give some interesting tame
algebras in a natural way.


2       Representation type of the centralizer subalgebras
        in the Auslander algebra of k[x]/(xn)
In the paper we will compose arrows of the quiver algebras from the right to the left. Let
k be an algebraically closed field. Recall that, according to [17], every finite-dimensional
associative k-algebra has either finite, tame or wild representation type. In what follows
we will call the latter statement the Tame and Wild Theorem. The algebras, which are
not of finite representation type, are said to be of infinite representation type.
    Let A = (Aob , Amor ) be a k-linear category. An A-module, M, is a functor from A to
the category of k-vector spaces. In particular, for x ∈ Aob and α ∈ Amor we will denote by
M(x) and M(α) the images of x and α under M respectively.
    For a positive integer n > 1 let An be the algebra given by the following quiver with
relations:
            a1               a2               an−1
                 *                +   ... k          +       ai bi = bi+1 ai+1 , i = 1, . . . , n − 2,
    1   j            2   j                               n
            b1               b2               bn−1
                                                             an−1 bn−1 = 0.

The algebra An is the Auslander algebra of k[x]/(xn ) (see for example [13, Section 7]). For
X ⊂ {2, 3, . . . , n} let eX denote the direct sum of all primitive idempotents of An , which


                                                         3
corrrespond to the vertexes from {1} ∪ X. Set AX
                                               n = eX An eX . The main result of this
section is the following:
Theorem 2.1.             (i) The algebra AX
                                          n has finite representation type if and only if X ⊂
    {2, n}.
 (ii) The algebra AXn has tame representation type if and only if either n > 3 and X = {3},
      {2, 3}, {n − 1}, {n − 1, n}, or n = 4 and X = {2, 3, 4}.
(iii) The algebra AX
                   n is wild in all other cases.

    To prove Theorem 2.1 we will need the following lemmas:
                                    {m}
Lemma 2.2. The algebra An                        has infinite representation type for m ∈ {3, . . . , n − 1} and
n ≥ 4.
                            {m}
Proof. The algebra An             is given by the following quiver with relations:

                                    a                                                   ax = ya,     xb = by,
                                                     +                                         m−1
                    x      91j                           mf       y                     ab = y     , ba = xm−1 ,             (1)
                                                                                          n−m+1
                                    b                                                   y       = 0,
where x = b1 a1 , y = bm am , a = am−1 . . . a1 , b = b1 . . . bm−1 . Modulo the square of the
         {m}
radical An gives rise to the following diagram of infinite type:

                                                              1 MMM             m.
                                                                     MMM qqqq
                                                                        MqMq
                                                                    qqqqq MMMM
                                                                  qq          M
                                                              1                          m
         {m}
Hence An       has infinite representation type as well.
Lemma 2.3. The algebra AX
                        n is wild for X = {3, m}, where m > 4.

Proof. In this case the algebra AX
                                 n is given by the following quiver with relations:

                                         y                                                     ax = ya,       xb = by,
                             a                           s                                    sy = zs,       yt = tz,
                                                                      +
               x   91j
                                     *
                                         3j                               mf        z          ab = y 2 ,     ba = x2 ,
                             b                            t                                    st = z m−3 ,   ts = y m−3 ,
                                                                                               z n−m+1 = 0,
where x = b1 a1 , y = b3 a3 , z = bm am , a = a2 a1 , b = b1 b2 , s = am−1 . . . a3 , t = b3 . . . bm−1 .
Note that z = 0 if m = n. Modulo the square of the radical AX        n gives rise to the following
diagram:

(where the dashed line disappears in the case m = n). With or without the dashed line
the diagram is not an extended Dynkin quiver and hence is wild (see [14, 12]). Hence AX
                                                                                      n
is wild as well.

Lemma 2.4. The algebra AX
                        n is wild for X = {2, n − 1} and n ≥ 5.

Proof. To make the quivers in the proof below look better we set m = n − 1. The algebra
AX
 n is given by the following quiver with relations:

relations x3 = y 3 = ab = ba = 0 (which is possible because of our restrictions on m and
n). Then the universal covering of B exists and has the following fragment,

(ab)n−1 = (ba)n = 0. The projective An -module P (1) is injective, so we can replace

An     by A′ = An /soc(P (1)) = An /((ba)n−1 ), which has the same indecomposable
modules except P (1), see [18, Lemma 9.2.2]. So from now on we consider the algebra A′ ,

i.e. add the relation (ba)n−1 = 0 to (2). The algebra A′ has a simply connected covering

A, see [9], which is the category, given by the following quiver with relations (we show the
case n = 5, in the general case the arrow starting at nk ends at 2n−2+k ):

We omit the indices at the arrows a, b, u, v. They satisfy the same relations as in A′ , which
are shown by the dotted lines. Consider the full subcategory Bm of e A with the set of objects
S = {1k , m ≤ k ≤ m + n − 1;L2k , m ≤ k ≤ m + n − 2; nm }. Let M be an e    A-module, Nm be
                               s
its restriction to Bm , Nm = i=1 Ki , where Ki are indecomposable Bm -modules. It is well
known that every Ki is completely determined by the subset of objects Si = {x | Ki (x) 6= 0}
and if 1m ∈ Si , then 1m+n−1 ∈
                             / Si . Moreover, all Ki (x) with x ∈ Si are one-dimensional and
all arrows between these objects correspond to the identity maps. Since uab = abv = 0,
Ki splits out of the whole module M whenever Si ⊇ {2m , 2m+n−2 }. Suppose that, for
every integer m, Nm does not contain such direct summands. It implies that M(vu) = 0.
Therefore M can be considered as a module over A, where A is given by the following quiver

                   ...                n′                                n′               ...                  n′                    ...

                  ... 1           /   2                /   1        /   2                / ...            /    2               /   1 ...
                                               u                                 u                                     u
                                                                                                             
                   ...                n                                 n                ...                   n                    ...

with relations uv = uab = abv = (ab)n−2 = 0. One easily checks that any indecomposable
representation of A is at most of dimension 2n−5. Hence, A is representation (locally) finite,
i.e. for every object x ∈ A there are only finitely many indecomposable representations M

                                                                                 7

with M(x) 6= 0. By [9], the algebra An                               is representation (locally) finite as well, which
completes the proof.

                                                         {q,n}
Proof. For q = n − 1 the algebra An                              is given by the following quiver with relations
                      u            a
                          (            (
        c    9   1h           qh           n       cn = ab = uv = 0, vu = cn−2 , cv = vba, uc = bau,
                      v            b

where c = b1 a1 , a = aq , b = bq , u = an−2 . . . a1 , v = b1 . . . bn−2 . The projective module P (1)
is also injective, hence, using [18, Lemma 9.2.2] as it was done in the proof of Lemma 2.7,
we can replace A by A′ = A/soc(P (1)) = A/(cq ). Let M be an A′ -module. Choose a basis in
M(1) so that the matrix C = M(c) is in the Jordan normal form, or, further,
                                                                     q
                                                                     M
                                                         M(c) =            Ji ⊗ Imi ,
                                                                     i=1

where Ji is the nilpotent Jordan block of size i × i and Imi is the identity matrix of size
mi × mi (here mi is just the number of Jordan blocks of size i). Thus

where the vertical (horizontal) stripes of A are of the same size as the horizontal (re-
spectively, vertical) stripes of B, and I is the identity matrix; we do not specify these
sizes here. Set r = nq/2; it is the number of the horizontal and vertical stripes in C.
Then M(u) and M(v) can be considered as block matrices: M(u) = U = (Ukij )5×r and
M(v) = V = (Vijk )r×5 , where k = 1, . . . , 5 correspond to the k-th horizontal stripe of B;
i = 1, . . . , q, j = 1, . . . , i, and the stripe (ij) corresponds to the j-th horizontal stripe of
the matrix Ji ⊗ Imi in the decomposition of C. The conditions uc = bau and cv = vba
imply that for i > 1 the only nonzero blocks Ukij and Vijk can be

                                                     Ukii        and U1i,i−1 = U5ii
                                                     Vi1k        and Vi25 = Vi11 .

                                                                      8
Moreover, we also have U511 = V111 = 0. Changing bases in the spaces M(x), x = 1, q, n, so
that the matrices A, B, C remain of the same form, we can replace U and V respectively
by T −1 US and S −1 V T , where S, T are invertible matrices of the appropriate sizes such
that SA = AS and T U = UQ, QV = V T for an invertible matrix Q. We also consider
                                    ij
S and T as block matrices: S = (Sst    )r×r and T = (Tlk )5×5 with respect to the division of
A, B, C. Then the conditions above can be rewritten as follows:
      ij
   • Sst can only be nonzero if i − j < s − t or i − j = s − t, s ≤ i;
      ij    ij ′
                            ′   ′
   • Sst = Sst′ if t − j = t − j ;


   • T is block triangular: Tlk = 0 if k < l, and T11 = T55 ;

   • all diagonal blocks Sijij and Tkk are invertible.

Especially, for the vertical stripes U ii and for the horizontal stripes Uk of the matrix U the
following transformations are allowed:

   1. Replace U ii by U ii Z.

   2. Replace Uk by ZUk , where k = 2, 3, 4.

   3. Replace U1 and U5 respectively by ZU1 and ZU5 .

   4. Replace U ii by U ii + U jj Z, where j < i.

   5. Replace Uk by Uk + Ul Z, where k < l.

Here Z denotes an arbitrary matrix of the appropriate size, moreover, in the cases 1–3 it
must be invertible. One can easily see that, using these transformations, one can subdivide
all blocks Ukii into subblocks so that each stripe contains at most one nonzero block, which
is an identity matrix. Note that the sizes of the horizontal substripes of U1 and U5 must
be the same. Let Λii and Λk be respectively the sets of the vertical and the horizontal
stripes of these subdivisions. Note that all stripes U ij must be subdivided respectively
to the subdivision of U ii and recall that U1i,i−1 = U5ii . Especially, there is a one-to-one
correspondence λ 7→ λ′ between Λ5 and Λ1 .
    We make the respective subdivision of the blocks of the matrix V , too. The condition
UV = 0 implies that, whenever the λ-th vertical stripe of U is nonzero (λ ∈ Λii ), the λ-th
horizontal stripe of V is zero. The conditions V U = C q can be rewritten as
                                      (
                                        I if (i, j, s, t) = (q, 1, q, q),
                           Vij U st =
                                        0 otherwise.

It implies that there are no zero vertical stripes in the new subdivision of U q,q . Moreover,
if λ ∈ Λii , µ ∈ Λk , and the block Vµλ is nonzero, then the µ-th vertical stripe of U is zero if
i 6= q; if i = q this stripe contains exactly one non-zero block, namely, Uλµ = I. We denote

                                               9
     ii
by Λ and Λk the set of those stripes from Λii and Λk , which are not completely defines
by these rules. Let λ ∈ Λ5 , λ′ be the corresponding element of Λ1 . If the blocks Uλµ and
    ′
Uλµ′ are both nonzero, write µ ∼ µ′ . Note that there is at most one element µ′ such that it
holds, and µ′ 6= µ.
                                    ii
      One can verify that the sets Λ and Λk can be linearly ordered so that, applying the
                                                                                           ′
transformations of the types 1–5 from above, we can replace a stripe V λ by V λ + V λ Z
with λ′ < λ and a stripe Vµ by Vµ + ZVµ′ , where λ′ < λ, µ′ < µ for any matrix Z (of
the appropriate size). We can also replace V λ by V λ Z, where Z is invertible, and replace
simultaneously Vµ and Vµ′ , where µ′ ∼ µ, by ZVµ and ZVµ′ (if µ′ does not exist, just replace
Vµ by ZVµ ) with invertible Z. Therefore, we obtain a special sort of the matrix problems
                                                                   {q,n}
considered in [8], which is known to be tame. Hence, the algebra An      is tame as well.
Proof of Theorem 2.1. Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.2 imply Theorem 2.1(i). The statement
of Theorem 2.1(iii) follows from Theorem 2.1(i) and Theorem 2.1(ii) using the Tame and
Wild Theorem. Hence we have to prove Theorem 2.1(ii) only.
   It is known, see for example [13], that An has finite representation type for n ≤ 3, is
tame for n = 4, and is wild for all other n. This, in particular, proves Theorem 2.1(ii) for
n ≤ 4.
   If n ≥ 6 then from Lemma 2.6 it follows that if AX  n is tame then X ⊂ {2, 3, n − 1, n}.
From Theorem 2.1(i) we know that X 6⊂ {2, n}. From Lemma 2.3 it follows that {3, n−1} 6⊂
X and {3, n} 6⊂ X. From Lemma 2.4 it follows that {2, n−1} 6⊂ X. This leaves us the cases
X = {n − 1, n}, {n − 1}, {2, 3} and {3}. In the first two cases AX n is tame by Lemma 2.8.
              {2,3}
The algebra An , n ≥ 3, is given by the following quiver with relations:
                               a              s
                                     *                 *       ab = ts,
                        1j               2j                3
                               b              t                (st)n−2 = 0,

where a = a1 , b = b1 , s = a2 , t = b2 . For n ≥ 5 this algebra is tame as a quotient of the
                                              {3}
classical tame problem from [26]. Hence An is tame as well.
    For n = 5 Lemma 2.5 implies that AX      n is wild if X ⊃ {3, 4}, Lemma 2.3 implies that
An is wild if X ⊃ {3, 5}, and Lemma 2.4 implies that AX
 X
                                                               n is wild if X ⊃ {2, 4}. Above
                                                {2,3}                       {3}
we have already shown that the algebras A5            is tame, and hence A5 is tame as well.
                            {4,5}        {4}
Finally, that the algebras A5     and A5 are tame follows from Lemma 2.8. This completes
the proof.


3     Proof of Theorem 1.1
We briefly recall the structure of ∞λ Hµ1 . We refer the reader to [5, 28, 20, 24] for details. By
[5, Theorem 5.9], the category ∞λ H01 is equivalent to the block Oλ of the BGG category O,
[6]. Let O(W, G) denote the basic associative algebra, whose module category is equivalent
to Oλ . The simple modules in Oλ are in natural bijection with the cosets W/G (under
this bijection the coset G corresponds to the dominant highest weight). For w ∈ W let

                                                  10
L(w) denote the corresponding simple module in Oλ , P (w) be the projective cover of L(w),
∆(w) be the corresponding Verma module, and I(w) be the injective envelope of L(w).
Then [28] implies that for the longest element w0 ∈ W one has EndOλ (P (w0)) ∼        = C(W, G)
(recall that this is the subalgebra of G-invariants in the coinvariant algebra, associated to
W). The left multiplication in W induces an action of H on the set W · λ. Let P (λ, H)
denote the direct sum of indecomposable projective modules that correspond to the longest
elements in all orbits of this action. The category ∞λ Hµ1 is equivalent, by [24], to the module
category over B(G, H) = EndOλ (P (λ, H)). From [28] it follows that B(G, H) depends on
G rather than on λ.
    We start with Theorem 1.1(1), that is with the case of finite representation type.
    Note that P (w0) is always a direct summand of P (λ, H). Hence C(W, G) is a centralizer
subalgebra of B(G, H). In particular, for ∞λ Hµ1 to be of finite representation type, C(W, G)
must be of finite representation type as well. According to [22, Theorem 7.2], C(W, G) is
of finite representation type in the following cases:
  (I) W = G;

 (II) W is of type An and G is of type An−1 ;

(III) W is of type Bn and G is of type Bn−1 ;

(IV) W is of type Cn and G is of type Cn−1 ;

 (V) W is of type G2 and G is of type A1 .
Moreover, in all these cases C(W, G) ∼  = C[x]/(xr ), where r = [W : G]. The last observation
and [20, Theorem 1] imply that in all the above cases the category Oλ is equivalent to
Ar −mod. In particular, the algebra B(G, H) is isomorphic to AX   r for appropriate X, and,
in the notation of Section 2, the algebra C(W, G) is the centralizer subalgebra, which
corresponds to the vertex 1.
    The case (I) gives Theorem 1.1(1a). In the cases (II), (III), (IV), and (V) it follows
from Theorem 2.1(i) that we have the following possibilities for B(G, H):
    B(G, H) has one simple module. This implies W = H and gives Theorem 1.1(1b).
    B(G, H) has two simple modules. These simples correspond either to the dominant
and the anti-dominant weights in Oλ or to the anti-dominant weight and its neighbor. By
a direct calculation we get the following: the case r = 2 gives Theorem 1.1(1c), and the
case r > 2 gives Theorem 1.1(1d).
    B(G, H) has three simple modules. These simples correspond to the following
weights in Oλ : the anti-dominant one, its neighbor, and the dominant one. By a direct
calculation we get the following: the case r = 3 gives Theorem 1.1(1h), and the case
r > 3 gives Theorem 1.1(1e), Theorem 1.1(1f), and Theorem 1.1(1g). This proves Theo-
rem 1.1(1).
    Let us now proceed with the tame case, that is with Theorem 1.1(2). If C(W, G) is of
finite representation type, that is in the cases (I)–(V), Theorem 2.1(ii) give us the following
possibilities for B(G, H):

                                              11
    B(G, H) has two simple modules. These simples correspond to the following weights
in Oλ : either the anti-dominant one and the neighbor of its neighbor, or the anti-dominant
one and the neighbor of the dominant one. By a direct calculation we get that these cases
lead to Theorem 1.1(2b) and Theorem 1.1(2c).
    B(G, H) has three simple modules. These simples correspond to the following
weights in Oλ : either the anti-dominant one, its neighbor, and the neighbor of its neighbor,
or the anti-dominant, its neighbor and the dominant one. By a direct calculation we get
that these cases lead to Theorem 1.1(2d) and Theorem 1.1(2e).
    B(G, H) has four simple modules. In this case r = 4 and a direct calculation gives
Theorem 1.1(2f).
    The rest (that is Theorem 1.1(2a)) should correspond to the case when C(W, G) is
tame. According to [22, Theorem 7.2], C(W, G) is tame in the following cases:

 (VI) W has rank 2 and G = {e};

(VII) W is of type A3 and G is of type A1 × A1 ;

(VIII) W is of type B3 and G is of type A2 ;

 (IX) W is of type C3 and G is of type A2 ;

  (X) W is of type Dn and G is of type Dn−1 .

For W = H the cases (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), and (X) give exactly Theorem 1.1(2a). Let
us now show that the rest is wild.
    If W 6= H then ∞λ Hµ1 has at least two non-isomorphic indecomposable projective mod-
ules, one of which is P (w0 ) and the other one is some P (w). We first consider the cases
(VII), (VIII), (IX), and (X). In all these cases the restriction of the Bruhat order to W/G
gives the following poset:

                                                   u1 B                                  (3)
                                              {{        BB
                                            {{            BB
                                          {{                BB
                                        {{                    B
           w0      w1       ...      ws C                          vs   ...   v1   v0
                                         CC                   ||
                                           CC               ||
                                             CC           ||
                                               C        ||
                                                   u2

From [22, Theorem 7.3] it follows that in all these cases the algebra C(W, G) has two
generators.
    We consider the centralizer subalgebra D(w) = EndOλ (P (w0 ) ⊕ P (w)) and let Q(w)
denote the quotient of D(w) modulo the square of the radical. Recall that the algebra
O(W, G)is Koszul, see [3], and hence the category Oλ is positively (Koszul) graded, see
also [29]. Hence D(w) is positively graded as well. We are going to show that D(w) is always
wild. We start with the following statement.


                                               12
Lemma 3.1. Let w ∈ {w1 , . . . , ws , u1 , u2 , v0 , . . . , vs }. Then
                                       (
                                           1, w ∈ {u1 , u2 , v0 , . . . , vs , w0 };
                [P (v0 ) : L(w)] =
                                           2, w ∈ {w1 , w3 , . . . , ws },

where [P (v0 ) : L(w)] denotes the composition multiplicity.
Proof. By [3] the category Oλ is Koszul dual to the regular block of the corresponding
parabolic category of Rocha-Caridi, see [27]. Hence the multiplicity question for Oλ re-
duces, via the Koszul duality, to the computation of the extensions in the parabolic case.
The latter are given by Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and for the algebras of type (VII),
(VIII), (IX), and (X) these multiplicities are computed in [19, § 14]. The statement of our
lemma follows directly from [19, § 14].
    Since L(w0 ) is a simple Verma module, it occurs exactly one time in the composition
series of ∆(w), which gives rise to a morphism, α : P (w0) → P (w). This morphism has the
minimal possible degree (with respect to our positive grading) and hence does not belong
to the square of the radical. Further, the unique (now by the BGG reciprocity) occurrence
of ∆(w) in the Verma flag of P (w0 ) gives a morphism, β : P (w) → P (w0 ), which does not
belong to the square of the radical either since it again has the minimal possible degree.
Now we will have to consider several cases.
    Case A. Assume first that w ∈ {v0 , v1 , . . . , vs }. The quiver of Q(w) contains the
arrows, corresponding to α and β. Moreover Q(w) also contains two loops at the point
w0 which correspond to the generators of C(W, G). Passing, if necessary, to a quotient of
Q(w), we obtain the following configuration:
                                            w0 NN                   w       .               (4)
                                                      NNN
                                                              ppppp
                                                         NNppN
                                                     ppppp NNNN
                                                    p             N
                                            w0                    w
Since the underlined diagram is not an extended Dynkin diagram, the configuration is wild,
see [14, 12]. This implies that D(w) and hence ∞λ Hµ1 is wild in this case.
    Case B. Consider now the case w = u1 (the case w = u2 is analogous). Lemma 3.1
implies that in this case the multiplicity of L(w) in ∆(v0 ) is 1. Hence from [2, Proposi-
tion 2.12] it follows that P (w) has simple socle L(w0 ), in particular, P (w) is a submodule of
P (w0 ) = I(w0 ). Injectivity of P (w0) thus gives a surjection from EndOλ (P (w0)) ∼ = C(W, G)
to EndOλ (P (w)). Note that, by [28], EndOλ (P (w0 )) is the center of O(W, G) and hence
is central in B(G, H). We still have the elements α and β as above, which do not be-
long to the square of the radical. Further, using the embedding P (w) ֒→ P (w0 ) one
also obtains that α generates HomOλ (P (w0 ), P (w)) as a C(W, G)-module and β generates
HomOλ (P (w), P (w0)) as a C(W, G)-module.
    With this notation, D(w) has the following quiver:
                                                         α
                                                                 +w
                                           6 w0 k                                   .
                                       x                                        y
                                                                        f
                                                         β


                                                         13
Note that α is surjective as a homomorphism from EndD(w) (P (w0)) to EndD(w) (P (w)) since
P (w) has simple socle. This and the fact that EndOλ (P (w0 )) is central implies the relations
αx = yα and βy = xβ. Using [22, 7.12-7.16] one also easily gets the following additional
relations: y s+2 = 0, αβ = cy s+1 for some 0 6= c ∈ C, xβα = βαx = 0 and (βα)2 = x2s+3 .
This implies that the universal covering of D(w) has the following fragment (shown for
s = 1):
                                       w0 O α       /w                                      (5)

                                         w0
(here the dashed arrow indicates the commutativity of the corresponding square). Evalu-
ating the Tits form of this fragment at the point (1, 2, 2, 2, 2), where 1 is placed in the bold
vertex, we obtain −1 < 0 implying that the fragment (5) is wild (see for example [11, 16]).
Hence D(w) is wild as well.
    Case C. Assume now that w = wi , i = 2, . . . , s − 1. Hence, by Lemma 3.1 the
multiplicity of L(w) in P (v0 ) is 2. We will need the following lemma:
Lemma 3.2. Let A be a basic associative algebra, let e be an idempotent of A and f be a
primitive direct summand of e. Assume that there exist two non-isomorphic A-modules M
and N satisfying the following properties:
(1) both M and N have simple top and simple socles isomorphic to the simple A-module
    LA (f ), corresponding to f ;
(2) e rad(M)/soc(M) = e rad(N)/soc(N) = 0.
Then dim Ext1eAe (LeAe (f ), LeAe (f )) > 1.
Proof. Recall from [1, Chapter 5] that eAe−mod is equivalent to the full subcategory M
of A−mod, consisting of all Ae approximations of modules from A−mod. Let M ′ and N ′
be the Ae-approximations of M and N respectively. Both M ′ and N ′ are indecomposable
since M and N are indecomposable by (1). Then the eAe-modules eM ′ and eN ′ are
indecomposable as well, and, because of (1) and (2), both eM ′ and eN ′ have length two
with both composition subquotients isomorphic to the simple eAe-module LeAe (f ).
    Assume that eM ′ ∼= eN ′ . Then, by [1, Chapter 5], any eAe-isomorphism between eM ′
and eN induces an A-isomorphism between M ′ and N ′ . From (1) we also have that the

canonical maps N → N ′ and M → M ′ are injective, that is we have
                                     N ֒→ N ′ ∼
                                              = M ′ ←֓ M.
From (1), the definition of the Ae-approximation, and the fact that f is a direct summand
of e, it follows that the image of N in N ′ coincides with the trace of the projective module
Af in N ′ . Analogously the image of M in M ′ coincides with the trace of the projective
module Af in M ′ . This implies M ∼  = N, a contradiction. The statement follows.

                                                      14
    Since we are not in the multiplicity-free case, from the Kazhdan-Lusztig Theorem it
follows that the quiver of O(W, G) contains more arrows than what is indicated on the
diagram (3). Namely, from the results of [19, § 14] we have Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(vi−1 )) 6= 0.
Note that Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(wi+1 )) 6= 0 also follows from the Kazhdan-Lusztig Theorem since
wi and wi+1 are neighbors (it follows from [19, § 14] as well). Let now u ∈ {vi−1 , wi+1 }.
Then we can fix a non-zero element from Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(u)). This means that L(u) occurs
in degree 1 in the projective module P (w). The module P (w) has a Verma flag, and
the above occurrence of L(u) gives rise to an occurrence of ∆(u) as a subquotient of
P (w). Since L(u) is in degree 1 and Oλ is positively graded, we can factor all the Verma
subquotients of P (w) except ∆(w) and ∆(u) out obtaining a non-split extension, N(u)
say, of ∆(u) by ∆(w). By duality, we have Ext1Oλ (L(u), L(w)) 6= 0 as well, and, as w < u,
the module L(w) occurs in degree 2 in the module N(u). This occurrence gives rise to a
map from N to the injective module I(w). Let N ′ (u) denote the image of this map. By
construction, the module N ′ (u) is an indecomposable module of Loewy length 3 with simple
top and simple socle isomorphic to L(w). Moreover, Rad(N ′ (u))/Soc(N ′ (u)) (the latter
is considered as an object of Oλ ) does not contain L(w) as a subquotient because of the
quasi-hereditary vanishing Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(w)) = 0. Since w 6= w0 , w1 , all occurrences of
L(w0 ) in P (w) are in degrees ≥ 2. Hence Rad(N ′ (u))/Soc(N ′ (u)) does not contain L(w0 )
as a subquotient either. Finally, we observe that Rad(N ′ (vi−1 ))/Soc(N ′ (vi−1 )) contains
L(vi−1 ) as a subquotient while Rad(N ′ (wi+1 ))/Soc(N ′ (wi+1 )) does not contain L(vi−1 ) as
a subquotient. This implies that N ′ (vi−1 ) ∼ 6= N ′ (wi+1 ). Hence, applying Lemma 3.2, we
obtain that the quiver of Q(w) contains at least two loops at the point w. This quiver also
contains the elements α and β described above. Factoring, if necessary, the extra arrows
out, Q(w) thus gives rise to the following configuration:
                                      w0 NN                w   .                          (6)
                                             NNN
                                                     ppppp
                                                NNppN
                                            ppppp NNNN
                                           p             N
                                      w0                 w
Since this is not an extended Dynkin quiver, this configuration is wild, see [14, 12]. Hence
D(w), and thus ∞λ Hµ1 is wild in this case.
   Case D. Let w = ws . In this case from [19, § 14] we have Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(vs−1 )) 6= 0.
We also have Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(ui )) 6= 0, i = 1, 2, since ws and ui are neighbors. Hence
the module P (w) contains exactly 3 copies of L(w) in degree 2: each lying in the top of
the radical of some of the Verma modules ∆(x), x = u1 , u2 , vs−1 , occurring in degree 1 in
the Verma filtration of P (w). Note that L(w) does not occur in degree 1 (see Case C).
Further, L(w0 ) occurs at most one time in degree 1 (this happens if s = 1, in which case
the occurrence in degree 1 corresponds to the socle of ∆(w)). In any case, since we have
3 occurrences of L(w) in degree 2, at most one occurrence of L(w0 ) in degree 1, and since
Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(w0)) ∼= C in the case s = 1, mapping the degree 2-occurrences to I(w) we
obtain at least two non-isomorphic modules, N1 and N2 , which have simple top and socle
isomorphic to L(w) and no other occurrences of L(w) and L(w0 ). Taking into account α
and β, from Lemma 3.2 it now follows that some quotient of Q(w) gives rise to the wild

                                                15
configuration (6). Hence D(w), and thus ∞λ Hµ1 is wild in this case as well.
    Case E. Finally, let w = w1 and s > 1. In this case both α and β have degree 1. From
[19, § 14] we have Ext1Oλ (L(w), L(v0 )) 6= 0, which gives us 2 occurrences of L(w) in degree
2 of the module P (w). One of them comes from the subquotient ∆(v0 ) in the Verma flag
of P (w). But v0 is dominant, and hence ∆(v0 ) is in fact a submodule. Denote by γ the
endomorphism of P (w) of degree 2, which corresponds to this occurrence of L(w) in ∆(v0 ).
Since (βα)2 6= 0 by [22, 7.12-7.16], it follows that the image of αβ contains some L(w0 ) in
degree 3. However, ∆(v0 ) does not contain any L(w0 ) in degree 2 (note that ∆(v0 ) itself
starts in degree 1 in P (w)). Hence αβ and γ are linearly independent and thus γ does not
belong to the square of the radical. Now we claim that γ 2 = γαβ = αβγ = 0. The first
and the second equalities, that is γ 2 = γαβ = 0, follow from the easy observation that
∆(v0 ) does not have any L(w) in degree 3 = 1 + 2. The last one, that is αβγ = 0, follows
from the fact that the degree 1-copy of ∆(v0 ) belongs to the kernel of β since P (w0 ) does
not have any L(v0 ) in degree 2. Now, P (w) has two copies of L(w) in the degree 2s which
correspond to the subquotients ∆(u1 ) and ∆(u2 ) in the Verma flag of P (w). Hence there
should exist an endomorphism of P (w) of degree 2s, which is linearly independent with
αβ. Since γ 2 = γαβ = αβγ = 0, it follows that this new endomorphism does not belong
to the square of the radical of Q(w). Taking into account α and β, from Lemma 3.2 it now
follows that some quotient of Q(w) gives rise to the wild configuration (6). Hence D(w),
and thus ∞λ Hµ1 is wild in this case as well.
    This completes the cases (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X).
    Finally, let us consider the case (VI). Let t1 and t2 be the simple reflections in W,
and let θt1 , θt2 be translation functors through the t1 and t2 -wall respectively. If H 6= W,
then ∞λ Hµ1 necessarily contains an indecomposable projective module, which corresponds to
some w such that l(w0 )−l(w) = 2. The modules θt1 L(w0 ) and θt2 L(w0 ) are indecomposable
and have the following Loewy filtrations:

                                     L(w0 )                            L(w0 )
                       θt1 L(w0 ) : L(t1 ′ w0 ) ,        θt2 L(w0 ) : L(t2 ′ w0 ) ,
                                     L(w0 )                            L(w0 )

for some t1 ′ , t2 ′ such that {t1 , t2 } = {t′1 , t′2 } (the exact values of t′1 and t′2 depend on the
type of W). In particular, θt1 L(w0 ) ∼      6= θt2 L(w0 ), both have simple top and simple socle
isomorphic to L(w0 ), and both do not contain any subquotient isomorphic to L(w) since
l(w0 ) − l(w) = 2. Hence from Lemma 3.2 it follows that the quotient of the corresponding
D(w) modulo the square of the radical gives rise to the wild configuration (4). Hence D(w)
is wild in this case. This proves Theorem 1.1(2).
    To complete the proof we just note that Theorem 1.1(3) follows from Theorem 1.1(1)
and Theorem 1.1(2) using the Tame and Wild Theorem.

4     The case of a semi-simple algebra g
Theorem 1.1 is formulated for a simple algebra g. However, in the case of a semi-simple
algebra the result is almost the same. In a standard way it reduces to the description of
the representation types of the tensor products of algebras, described in Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 4.1. Let k > 1 be a positive integer, and Xi , i = 1, . . . , k, be basic algebras
associated to non-semi-simple categories from the list of Theorem 1.1. Then the algebra
X1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Xk is never of finite representation type, and it is of tame representation type
only in the following two cases:

(1) k = 2 and both X1 and X2 have Coxeter type (A1 , e, A1 );

(2) k = 2, one of X1 and X2 has Coxeter type (A1 , e, A1 ), and the other one has Coxeter
    type (A1 , e, e).

Proof. The algebra in (1) is isomorphic to C[x, y]/(x2 , y 2) and hence is tame with well-
known representations. Let us thus consider the algebra X of the case (2). This algebra is
given by the following quiver with relations
                             u
            x          91j
                                        *

Lemma 4.2. The algebra of (7) is tame.
Proof. This algebra is tame by [4], however, since the last paper is not easily available
and does not contain a complete argument, we prove the tameness of X. Consider the
subalgebra X′ ⊂ X generated by x, y, u. Its indecomposable representations are

Here the elements ei form a basis of the space corresponding to the vertex 1, the elements
fj form a basis of the space corresponding to the vertex 2, the vertical arrows show the
action of x and y, and the arrows going from left to right show the action of u. Let M
be an X-module. Decompose it as X′ -module. Then the matrix V describing the action
of v divides into the blocks Vij , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , 11, corresponding to the basic elements
ei and fj from above. Moreover, since uv = 0, the blocks Vij can only be nonzero if
i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}; since xv = vy, Vij = 0 if i > 4, j < 5 or i > 7, j < 8, and Vij = Vi+7,j+7
for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. If M ′ is another X-module, V ′ = (Vij′ ) is the corresponding block

                                                              17
matrix, a homomorphism M → M ′ is given by a pair of matrices S, T , where S : M(1) →
M(1), T : M(2) → M(2). Divide them into blocks corresponding to the division of V :
S = (Sij ), T = (Tij ), i, j = 1, 2, . . . , 11. One can easily check that such block matrices
define a homomorphism M → M ′ if and only if the following conditions hold:
   • S and T are block triangular, i.e. Sij = 0 and Tij = 0 if i > j.
   • Sij = Si+7,j+7 and Tij = Ti+7,j+7 for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.
   • Sii = Tjj if in the list (8) there is an arrow ei → fj .
   • Sij = Tkl if in the list (8) there are arrows ei → fk and ej → fl .
   • Sij = 0 if (i, j) ∈ {(4, 5), (4, 6), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)}.
   • Tij = 0 if (i, j) ∈ {(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (7, 8)}.
Certainly, S, T define an isomorphism if and only if all diagonal blocks are invertible. In
particular, we can replace the part V1 = (V11 V12 V13 V14 ) by S1−1 V1 T1 , where S1 is any
invertible matrix and T1 = (Tij ), i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} is any invertible block triangular matrix.
So we can suppose that V1 is of the form
                                                                  
                             0 I (1) 0 0 0 0 0 0
                           0 0 0 I (2) 0 0 0 0 
                                                                  
                           0 0 0 0 0 I (3) 0 0  ,
                                                                  
                           0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I (4) 
                             0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
where the vertical lines show the division of V1 into blocks, I (k) denote identity matrices
(of arbitrary sizes). Denote the parts of the blocks V1j to the right of I (k) by V1k,j and
those to the right of the zero part of V1 by V5j . Using automorphisms, we can make zero
all V11,j and V12,j , as well as the blocks V13,j and V14,j for j > 6. Note that V1j = V8,j+7 ,
and we can also make zero all parts of the blocks V1,j+7 over the parts I (j) of the blocks
V8,j+7. Subdivide the blocks of S and T corresponding to this subdivision of V1 . Note that,
since S22 = T99 = T33 , we must also subdivide the blocks S2j into S20,j and S21,j respective
to the zero and nonzero parts of V13 . Then the extra conditions for the new blocks are:
                               S21,20 = 0 and S1k,1l = 0 if k > l.
Therefore, we get a matrix problem considered in [8]. It is described by the semichain
                          f5       /   f6 NNN / f7 NNN
                                             NNN      NNN
                                                &        /& f9
                                                  f8             /   f10   /   f11
for the columns, the chain
                            e5 → e3 → e21 → e20 → e15 → e14 → e13
for the rows, and the unique equivalence e3 ∼ f6 . This matrix problem is tame, hence, the
algebra X is tame as well.

                                                       18
   If k > 2 then each of X1 , X2 , and X3 has at least one projective module with non-trivial
endomorphism ring and thus X1 ⊗ X2 ⊗ X3 contains a centralizer subalgebra, which surjects
onto C[x, y, z]/(x, y, z)2 . The later algebra is wild by [15] and hence X is wild.
   If k = 2 but none of the conditions (1), (2) is satisfied, then one of the algebras X1 and
X2 has a projective module, whose endomorphism algebra surjects onto C[x]/(x3 ), and the
other one has a projective module, whose endomorphism algebra surjects onto C[y]/(y 3).
Hence there is a centralizer subalgebra in X, which surjects onto C[x, y]/(x3 , y 2), the later
being wild by [15]. This shows that X1 ⊗ X2 is wild as well and completes the proof.
