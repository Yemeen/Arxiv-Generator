                                                     Abstract. Parabolic subalgebras of semi-simple Lie algebras decompose as
                                                     p = m ⊕ n where m is a Levi factor and n the corresponding nilradical. By
                                                     Richardsons theorem [R], there exists an open orbit under the action of the
                                                     adjoint group P on the nilradical. The elements of this dense orbits are known
                                                     as Richardson elements.
                                                         In this paper we describe a normal form for Richardson elements in the
                                                     classical case. This generalizes a construction for glN of Brüstle, Hille, Ringel
                                                     and Röhrle [BHRR] to the other classical Lie algebra and it extends the authors
                                                     normal forms of Richardson elements for nice parabolic subalgebras of simple
                                                     Lie algebras to arbitrary parabolic subalgebras of the classical Lie algebras [B].
                                                     As applications we obtain a description of the support of Richardson elements
                                                     and we recover the Bala-Carter label of the orbit of Richardson elements.

                                                The goal of this paper is to describe Richardson elements for parabolic subalge-
                                             bras of the classical Lie algebras.
                                                Let p be a parabolic subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra g over C and p =
                                             m ⊕ n a Levi decomposition. By a fundamental theorem of Richardson [R] there
                                             always exist elements x in the nilradical n such that [p, x] = n. In other words, if
                                             P is the adjoint groups of p, then the orbit P · x is dense in n. It is usually called
                                             the Richardson orbit. Richardson orbits have been studied for a long time and
                                             there are many open questions related to this setting. Our goal is to give explicit
                                             representatives for Richardson elements. In the case of gln there is a beautiful way
                                             to construct Richardson elements that has been described by Brüstle, Hille, Ringel
                                             and Röhrle in [BHRR]. Furthermore, Richardson elements with support in the first
                                             graded part g1 (where the grading is induced from the parabolic subalgebra) have
                                             been given for all simple Lie algebras in [B].
                                                However, these constructions do not work in general for classical Lie algebras.
                                             To fill this gap, we have modified the existing approaches to obtain Richardson
                                             elements for parabolic subalgebras of the classical Lie algebras. We do this using
                                             certain simple line diagrams. They correspond to nilpotent matrices with at most
                                             one non-zero entry in each row and in each column. We show that for most parabolic
                                             subalgebras, there exists a simple line diagram that defines a Richardson element.
                                             But there are cases where this is not possible as we will see. We expect that the
                                             representatives we describe will give more insight and hopefully answer some of
                                             the open questions. One of the interesting questions in the theory of Richardson
                                             elements is the structure of the support of a Richardson element. Recall that any

parabolic subalgebra p induces a Z-grading of g,

                                                            M
                   g = ⊕i∈Z gi   with   p = ⊕i≥0 gi = g0 ⊕ (  gi )
                                                             i>0


where g0 is a Levi factor and n := ⊕i>0 gi the corresponding nilradical. For details,
we refer
      P to our joint work with Wallach, [BW]. The support of a Richardson element
X = α root of n kα Xα are the roots of the nilradical n with kα 6= 0 (where Xα spans
the root subspace gα ). The support supp(X) of X lies in the subspace g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gk
for some k ≥ 1. For the normal form of Richardson elements we can determine the
minimal k0 such that supp(X) ⊂ g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gk0 . We also recover the Bala-Carter
label of the dense orbit of Richardson elements, also called the type of the orbit.
The Bala-Carter label is used in the classification of nilpotent orbits of simple Lie
algebras, given in [BC]. For a description of these labels see chapter 8 of [CM].
The type of any nilpotent orbit in a classical Lie algebra has been described by
Panyushev [P] in terms of the partitions of the orbit.
Before we describe our results and explain the structure of this article, we need to
fix some notation. If p is a parabolic subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra g we
can assume that p contains a fixed Borel subalgebra. In this case we say that p is
standard. If m is a Levi factor of p we say that m is standard if it contains a fixed
Cartan subalgebra h that is contained in the fixed Borel subalgebra.
   From now on we will assume that g is a classical Lie algebra, unless stated
otherwise. As usual, the Cartan subalgebra consists of the diagonal matrices and
the fixed Borel subalgebra is the set of upper triangular matrices. Then a standard
Levi factor has the shape of a sequence of square matrices (blocks) on the diagonal
and zeroes outside. In the case of so2n , we have to be careful: we will only consider
parabolic subalgebras where αn and αn−1 are both roots of the Levi factor or
both roots of the nilradical or αn−1 a root of the Levi factor and αn a root of
the nilradical. In other words the case αn a root of the Levi factor and αn−1 a
root of the nilradical will be identified with this last case since the two parabolic
subalgebras are isomorphic. So our standard p or m are uniquely defined by the
sequence d := d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) of the sizes of these blocks (and by specifying the
type of the Lie algebra).
   We start by defining line diagrams for dimension vectors in section 1. It will
turn out that each horizontal line diagram corresponds uniquely to elements of
the nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra of sln of the given dimension vector. In
section 2 we gather the necessary properties of Richardson elements. In section 3 we
show that horizontal line diagrams in fact correspond to Richardson elements of the
given parabolic subalgebra. The construction of such diagrams for gln appears first
in [BHRR]. We have alreday mentioned that for the other classical Lie algebras,
the horizontal line diagrams do not give Richardson elements. In general, the
matrix obtained is not an element of the Lie algebra in question. Thus we will
introduce generalized line diagrams in section 4 to obtain Richardson elements for
parabolic subalgebras of the symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras. As a by-
product we obtain the partition of a Richardson element for the so-called simple
parabolic subalgebras. The last section discusses the cases where line diagrams do
not produce Richardson elements. For these we will allow “branched” diagrams.
In the appendix we add examples illustrating branched diagrams.

                                    1. Line diagrams
   Let d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) be a dimension vector, i.e. a sequence of positive integers.
Arrange r columns of di dots, top-adjusted. A (filled) line diagram for d, denoted
by L(d), is a collection of lines joining vertices of different columns such that each
vertex is connected to at most one vertex of a column left of it and to at most one
vertex of a column right of it and such that it cannot be extended by any line.
   We say that it is a (filled) horizontal line diagram if all edges are horizontal
lines. Such a diagram will be denoted by Lh (d). We will always assume that the
line diagrams are filled and omit the term ‘filled’. Line diagrams are not unique.
However, for each dimension vector there is a unique horizontal line diagram.
Example 1. As an example, consider the dimension vector (3, 1, 2, 3) and three
line diagrams for it, the last one horizontal.

                                2. Richardson elements
   In this section we describe a method to check whether a given nilpotent element of
the nilradical of a classical Lie algebra is a Richardson element. The first statement
is given in [BW]. Since we will use this result constantly, we repeat its proof.
Theorem 2.1. Let p ⊂ g be a parabolic subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra g,
let p = m ⊕ n where m is a Levi factor and n the corresponding nilradical. Then
x ∈ n is a Richardson element for p if and only if dim gx = dim m.
Proof. Denote the nilradical of the opposite parabolic by n (the opposite parabolic
is defined as the parabolic subalgebra whose intersection with p is equal to m). If
x ∈ n then ad(x)g = ad(x)n + ad(x)p. Now ad(x)p ⊂ n and dim ad(x)n ≤ dim n.
Thus
                                dim ad(x)g ≤ 2 dim n.
This implies for x ∈ n that dim m ≤ dim gx and equality implies that dim ad(x)p =
dim n. Thus equality implies that x is a Richardson element.
   For the other direction, let x be a Richardson element for p. We show that the
map ad(x) is injective on n: Let y ∈ n with ad(x)y = 0. Then
                     0 = B(ad(x)y, p) = B(y, ad(x)p) = B(y, n).
In particular, y = 0. So ad(x) is injective on n, giving dim ad(x)n = dim n. Thus
                            n              n
                        z }| {       z }| {
                    dim ad(x)p + dim ad(x)n         = 2 dim n
                                                    = dim ad(x)g
                                                    = dim g − dim gx
So dim gx +dim n = dim g−dim n = dim p = dim m+dim n, i.e. dim m = dim gx . 
Corollary 2.2. Let p = m⊕n be a parabolic subalgebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra.
Let X ∈ n be a Richardson element.
  Then dim gX ≤ dim gY for any Y ∈ n.

   Theorem 2.1 gives us a tool to decide whether an element of the nilradical of
a parabolic subalgebra is a Richardson element. Namely, we have to calculate its
centralizer. Centralizers of nilpotent elements of the classical Lie algebras can be
computed using their Jordan canonical form. This well-known result is due to Kraft
and Procesi, cf. [KP].
Theorem 2.3. Let (n1 , . . . , nr ) be the partition of the Jordan canonical form of a
nilpotent matrix x in the Lie algebra g, let (m1 , . . . , ms ) be the dual partition. Then
the dimension of the centralizer of x in g is
                        P 2
                           mi                        if g = gln
                         i
                        P mi 2
                                   1
                            2 + 2 |{i | ni odd}| if g = sp2n
                         i
                        P  m2i     1
                            2 − 2 |{i | ni odd}| if g = soN
                          i

   So it remains to determine the Jordan canonical form of a given nilpotent element
x. It is given by the dimensions of the kernels of the maps xj , j ≥ 1:
Lemma 2.4. Let x be a nilpotent n × n matrix with xm−1 6= 0 and xm = 0, set
bj := dim ker xj (j = 1, . . . , m). Define
                         
                          2b1 − b2               j=1
                   aj :=        2bj − bj−1 − bj+1 j = 2, . . . , m − 1
                         
                                bm − bm−1         j=m
Then the Jordan canonical form of x has as blocks of size s for s = 1, . . . , m.
Corollary 2.5. With the notation of Lemma 2.4 above, the Jordan canonical form
of x is given by the partition
                           (1a1 , 2a2 , . . . , (m − 1)am−1 , mam ).

                       3. The special linear Lie algebra
   We now describe how to obtain a Richardson element from a (horizontal) line
diagram. Recall that a standard parabolic subalgebra of sln is uniquely described
by the sequence of lengths of the blocks in m (the standard Levi factor). Let
d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) be the dimension vector of these block lengths.
   We form the horizontal line diagram Lh (d) and label its vertices column wise by
the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n, starting with column 1, labeling top-down. This labeled
diagram defines a nilpotent element as the sum of all elementary matrices Eij such
that there is a line from i to j, where i < j:
                                                      X
                                 X(d) = X(Lh (d)) =       Eij
                                                      i—j

Example 2. Let p ⊂ sl9 be given by the dimension vector (3, 1, 2, 3). We label its
horizontal line diagram,
                                1 4 5 7,

                                       2        6    8

                                       3             9
and obtain X(d) = E1,4 +E4,5 +E5,7 +E2,6 +E6,8 +E3,9 , an element of the nilradical
n of p. Using Lemma 2.4 and Corollary 2.5 one checks that the dimension of the
               RICHARDSON ELEMENTS FOR CLASSICAL LIE ALGEBRAS                         5


centralizer of X(d) is equal to the dimension of the Levi factor. Thus X(d) is a
Richardson element for p (by Theorem 2.3).
   By construction, the matrix X(d) is nilpotent for any dimension vector d. It is in
fact an element of the nilradical n of the parabolic subalgebra p = p(d): If d = (n),
this is obvious, the constructed nilpotent element is the zero matrix. If d = (d1 , d2 )
then the nonzero coefficients of the matrix of X(d) are in the rows 1, . . . , d1 and
columns d1 + 1, . . . , d2 . In other words, they lie in the d1 × d2 -block in the upper
right corner. The standard Levi factor consists of the blocks d1 × d1 , d2 × d2 on
the diagonal. In particular, X(d1 , d2 ) is a matrix that lies above the Levi factor.
This generalizes to dimension vectors with more entries. So we get part (1) of the
following Lemma. For part (2) we introduce a new notion.
Definition 1. If there exists a sequence of k connected lines in a line diagram L(d)
that is not contained in a longer sequence we say that L(d) has a k-chain or a chain
of length k. A subchain of length k (or k-subchain) is a sequence of k connected
lines in L(d) that maybe contained in a longer chain. A (sub)chain of length 0 is a
single vertex that is not connected to any other vertex.
Lemma 3.1. (1) The element X(d) is an element of the nilradical of p(d).
   (2) For k ≥ 1, the rank of X(d)k is equal to the number of k-subchains of lines
in Lh (d).
Proof of (2). It is clear that the rank of X = X(d) is the number of lines in the
diagram: to construct X, we sum over all lines of the diagram. Since these lines
are disjoint (each vertex i is joint to at most one neighbour j with i < j) the rows
and columns of X are linearly independent. Therefore the rank of X is equal to
the number of vertices i such that there is a line from i to some j with i < j.
    For any k > 0, the matrix X k consists of linearly independent rows and columns.
It is clear that an entry
                      P (ij) ofP X · X is non-zero if and only if there is a line i—k—j
in Lh (d): X · X = i−k Eik l−j Elj where Eik Elj = δkl Eij . Similarly, the rank
of X k is the number of vertices i such that there exist vertices j1 < j2 < · · · < jk
and lines i—j1 — · · · —jk joining them, i.e. the number of k-subchain.               
    It turns out that X(d) is a Richardson element for p(d), as we will show below.
This fact follows also from the description of Brüstle et al. in [BHRR] of ∆-
filtered modules without self-extension of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type Ar
(the number r is the number of blocks in the standard Levi factor of the parabolic
subalgebra).
Theorem
P          3.2. The mapping d 7→ X(d) associates to each dimension vector with
   di = n a Richardson element for the corresponding parabolic subalgebra p = p(d)
of sln .
   We give here an elementary proof of Theorem 3.2 above. We will use the ideas
of this proof to deal with the other classical groups (where we will have to use line
diagrams that are not horizontal in general). The main idea is to use the dimension
of the centralizer of a Richardson element and the partition of the Jordan canonical
form of a nilpotent element.
Proof. Let d be the dimension vector corresponding to the parabolic subalgebra
p = p(d). Let X = X(d) be the nilpotent element associated it (through the
horizontal line diagram). By Theorem 2.1 we have to calculate the dimension of

thePcentralizer of X and of the Levi factor m of p. By Theorem 2.3, dim gX is equal
to i m2i − 1 where (m1 , . . . , ms ) is the dual partition to the partition of X. The
parts of the dual partition are the entriesP  of di the dimension vector as is shown in
Lemma 3.3 below. In particular, dim l = i d2i − 1 = dim gX .                         
   The following result shows how to obtain the partition and the dual partition
of the Jordan canonical form of the nilpotent element associated to the dimension
vector d.
Lemma 3.3. Let d be the dimension vector for p ⊂ sln , X = X(d) the associated
nilpotent element of sln . Order the entries d1 , . . . , dr of the dimension vector in
decreasing order as D1 , D2 , . . . , Dr (i.e. such that Di ≥ Di+1 for all i). Then the
Jordan canonical form of X is
                       1D1 −D2 , 2D2 −D3 , . . . , (r − 1)Dr−1 −Dr , rDr
and the dual partition is
                                    Dr , Dr−1 , . . . , D1 .
    In other words, the dual partition for X(d) is given by the entries of the dimension
vector. Furthermore, for every i-chain in Lh (d) (i.e. for every sequences of length
i, i ≥ 0, that is not contained in a longer sequence) the partition has an entry i.
Proof. Let d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) be the dimension vector of p and D1 , . . . , Dr its permu-
tation in decreasing order, Di ≥ Di+1 . To determine the Jordan canonical form of
X = X(d) we have to compute the rank of the powers X s , s ≥ 1, cf. Lemma 2.4.
   Since the nilpotent matrix X is given by the horizontal line diagram Lh (d),
the rank of X s is easy to compute: by Lemma 3.1 (2), the rank of X s is the
number of s-subchains. In particular, rk X = n − D1 and rk X 2 = n − D1 − D2 ,
rk X 3 = n − D1 − D2 − D3 , etc. This gives
                  bs := dim ker X s = D1 + · · · + Ds for s = 1, . . . , r.
And so, by Lemma 2.4, we obtain a1 = D1 −D2 , a2 = D2 −D3 , . . . , ar = Dr proving
the first statement. The statement about the dual partition (i.e. the partition given
by the lengths of the columns of the partition) follows then immediately.          

     4. Richardson elements for the other classical Lie algebras
   In this section we will introduce generalized line diagrams to deal with the sym-
plectic and orthogonal Lie algebras. Having introduced them, we show that they
correspond to Richardson elements for the parabolic subalgebra in question. Then
we discuss some properties and describe the dual of the partition of a nilpotent
element given by such a generalized line diagram. Furthermore, we describe the
support of the constructed X(d) and relate it to the Bala-Carter label of the G-orbit
through X(d) where G is the adjoint group of g.
   To define the orthogonal Lie algebras, we use the skew diagonal matrix Jn with
ones on the skew
                  diagonal
                         and zeroes else. The symplectic Lie algebras sp2n are
                 0     Jn
defined using             . (For details we refer the reader to [GW].) So son consists
                −Jn     0
of the n × n-matrices that are skew-symmetric around the skew-diagonal and sp2n
is the set of 2n × 2n-matrices of the form
                                            
                                        A B
                                        C A∗
                   RICHARDSON ELEMENTS FOR CLASSICAL LIE ALGEBRAS                                               7


where A∗ is the the negative of the skew transpose of A. Thus in the case of the
symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras, the block sizes of the standard Levi factor
form a palindromic sequence.
    If there is an even number of blocks in the Levi factor, the dimension vector is
of the form (d1 , . . . , dr , dr , . . . , d1 ). We will refer to this situation as type (a). If
there is an odd number of blocks in the Levi factor, type (b), the dimension vector
is (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d1 ).
    By the (skew) symmetry around the skew diagonal, the entries below the skew di-
agonal of the matrices X(d) are determined by the entries above the skew diagonal.
In terms of line diagrams: For spN and soN there is a line (N − j + 1)—(N − i + 1)
whenever there is a line i—j. We will call the line (N − j + 1)—(N − i + 1) the
counterpart of i—j and will sometimes denote counterparts by dotted lines. In
particular, it suffices to describe the lines attached to the left to vertices of the first
r columns for both types (a) and (b).
    The (skew)-symmetry will give constraints on the diagram - there will also appear
negative entries. For the moment, let us assume that L(d) is a diagram defining an
element of the nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra in question. Then part (2) of
Lemma 3.1 still holds.
Lemma 4.1. If X(d) is defined by L(d) then the rank of the map X(d)k is the
number of k-subchains of lines in the diagram.
   This uses the same argument as Lemma 3.1 since by construction, X(d) only has
linearly independent rows and columns and the product X(d)2 only has nonzero
entries Eil if X(d) has an entry Eij and an entry Ejl for some j.
   The following remark allows us to simplify the shapes of the diagrams we are con-
sidering. If d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) is an r-tuple in Nr , and σ ∈ Sr (where Sr is the permu-
tation group on r letters) we define dσ as (dσ1 , dσ2 , . . . , dσr ). By abuse of notation,
for d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr , . . . , d1 ) in N2r , we write dσ = (dσ1 , . . . , dσr , dσr , . . . , dσ1 ) and
for d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d1 ) in N2r+1 , we define dσ to be the 2r + 1-tuple
(dσ1 , . . . , dσr , dr+1 , dσr , . . . , dσ1 ). It will be clear from the context which tuple we
are referring to.
Remark 4.2. For d = (d1 , . . . , dr ) the diagrams Lh (d) and Lh (dσ ) have the same
chains of lines for any σ ∈ Sr . In other words: for any k ≥ 1, the number of chains
of lines of length k in Lh (d) is the same as the number of lines of length k in Lh (dσ ).
As an illustration, consider the permutation 1243 of d = (3, 1, 2, 3):
                                •      •     •     •        •      •     •     •

                                •            •     •        •      •     •

                                •                  •               •     •
Similarly, for f = (f1 , . . . , fr , fr , . . . , f1 ) resp. for g = (g1 , . . . , gr , gr+1 , gr , . . . , g1 ),
if L(f ) and L(g) are line diagrams for sp2n or soN then for any σ ∈ Sr , the diagrams
L(fσ ) resp. L(gσ ) are also diagrams for the corresponding Lie algebras and have
the same exactly the same chains as L(f ) resp. as L(g).
   We have an immediate consequence of Remark 4.2 and of Lemma 4.1:
Corollary 4.3. Let d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr , . . . , d1 ) or d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d1 )
be the dimension vector of a parabolic subalgebra of a symplectic or orthogonal Lie
8                                       KARIN BAUR


algebra and X(d) be given by the appropriate line diagram. In calculating the rank
of X(d)k we can assume that d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr .
   We will make frequent use of this property. Now we will finally be able to
construct diagrams for the other classical cases. We have already mentioned that
the horizontal line diagrams do not produce Richardson elements. One reason is
that the counterpart of a line i—j is not always horizontal. The other reason is
that we have to introduce negative signs for the symplectic and orthogonal cases
when we associate a nilpotent matrix to a diagram: If g = sp2n , in the definition
of X(d) we subtract Eij whenever there is a line i—j with n < i < j. If g = soN
we subtract Eij whenever there is a line i—j with i + j > N .
Example 3. Let (1, 2, 2, 1) be the dimension vector of a parabolic subalgebra of
sp6 . Then the following three line diagrams determine elements of the nilradical of
p:
                 1 2 4 6            1 2 == 4 6       1 2 5 6
                                          =
                       3    5               3    5               3    4
The last diagram is just a reordering of the second. The nilpotent elements are
X1 = E12 + E24 + E35 − E56 resp. X2 = E12 + E25 + E34 − E56 . By calculating
the Jordan canonical forms for these elements one checks that only the nilpotent
element X2 is a Richardson element.
   This example and the discussion above illustrate that for the symplectic and
orthogonal Lie algebras, we will use:
   (i) non-horizontal lines,
   (ii) labeling top-bottom and bottom-top,
   (iii) negative signs, too.
Before we start defining these line diagrams we introduce a new notion.
Definition 2. Let p be the standard parabolic subalgebra of a symplectic or or-
thogonal Lie algebra g. We say that p is simple if p ⊂ g is of one of the following
forms:
    (1) A parabolic subalgebra of sp2n with an even number of blocks in the stan-
        dard Levi factor.
    (2) A parabolic subalgebra of so2n with an even number of blocks in the stan-
        dard Levi factor such that odd block lengths appear exactly twice.
    (3) A parabolic subalgebra of sp2n with an odd number of blocks in the Levi
        factor and such that each odd di that is smaller than dr+1 appears exactly
        twice.
    (4) A parabolic subalgebra of soN with an odd number of blocks in the Levi
        factor such that either all di are odd or there is an index k ≤ r such that
        all di with i ≤ k are even, dj odd for j > k and the even di are smaller
        than dk+1 , . . . , dr . Furthermore, the even block lengths that are larger than
        dr+1 appear only once among d1 , . . . , dk .
Definition 3 (Type (a)). Let p be a simple parabolic subalgebra of sp2n or so2n ,
given by the dimension vector d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr , . . . , d1 ). Then we define the line
diagram Leven (d) associated to d (and g) as follows.
    (1) Draw 2n vertices in 2r columns of length d1 , . . . , top-adjusted. Label the
        first r columns with the numbers 1, . . . , n, top–bottom. Label the second r
        columns with the numbers n + 1, . . . , 2n, bottom–top.

    (2) Join the first r columns with horizontal lines as for sln . Draw the counter-
         parts of these lines in the second r columns.
 (3) (i) If g = sp2n , add the lines k—(2n − k + 1).
(3) (ii) If g = so2n , one adds the lines (2l − 1)—(2n − 2l + 1) and their counterparts
         2l—(2n − 2l + 2) if n is even. If n is odd, the lines 2l—(2n − 2l) and their
         counterparts (2l + 1)—(2n − 2l + 1).
Definition 4 (Type (b)). Let p be a simple parabolic subalgebra of sp2n or of soN ,
given by the dimension vector d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d1 ). Then we define the
line diagram Lodd (d) associated to d (and g) as follows.
    (1) Draw 2r + 1 columns of length d1 , . . . , top-adjusted. Label them with the
         numbers 1, . . . in increasing order, top–bottom in each column.
 (2) (i) For sp2n :
         If mini {di } ≥ 2, draw a horizontal of lines in the first row and all their
         counterparts, forming a sequence joining the lowest vertices of each column.
         Repeat this procedure as long as the columns of the remaining vertices are
         all at least of length two.
(2) (ii) For soN :
         If d1 is odd, go to step (3) (ii). If d1 is even, do as in (2) (i), drawing lines
         in the first row and their counterparts joining the lowest vertices. Repeat
         until either the first of the remaining columns has odd length or there are
         no vertices left to be joined. Continue as in (3) (ii).
 (3) (i) For sp2n :
         For the remaining vertices: draw horizontal lines following the top-most
         remaining vertices and simultaneously their counterparts (the lowest re-
         maining vertices).
(3) (ii) For soN :
         All columns have odd length. Connect the central entries of each column.
         The remaining column lengths are all even, the are joined as in (2) (ii).
Theorem 4.4. Let d be the dimension vector for a simple parabolic subalgebra of
sp2n or soN . Then the associated diagram Leven (d) resp. Lodd (d) determines a
Richardson element for p(d) by setting
                      P                   P
           X(d) =                  E − i—j, i>n Eij          for sp2n
                      Pi—j, i≤n ij          P
           X(d) =       i—j, i+j<N    Eij −   i—j, i+j>N Eij for soN
where the sums are over all lines in the diagram.
   We first include some immediate consequences of this result. After that we add
an observation about the (dual of the) partition corresponding to X(d) and then
we are ready to prove Theorem 4.4.
   Theorem 4.4 enables us to determine the minimal k such that the Richard-
son element X(d) lies in the graded parts g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gk . To do so we introduce
s(d) as the maximal number of entries di , . . . , di+s of d that are surrounded by
larger entries di−1 and di+s+1 . More precisely, if d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr , . . . , d1 ) or
d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , . . . , d1 ) is the dimension vector, we rewrite d as a vector with
increasing indices,
   (c1 . . . , cr , cr+1 , cr+2 , . . . , c2r ) resp.
   (c1 . . . , cr , cr+1 , cr+2 , . . . , c2r+1 ) and define
   s(d) := 1 + maxi {there are cj+1 , . . . , cj+i | cj > cj+l < cj+i+1 for all 0 ≤ l ≤ i}.

Corollary 4.5. Let p(d) be a simple parabolic subalgebra of the orthogonal or sym-
plectic Lie algebras. Then the element X(d) belongs to g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gs(d) . The same
holds for parabolic subalgebras of sln .
   This follows from the fact that Eij with i from column k of the line diagram and
j from column k+s is an entry of the graded part gs . If, e.g., we have c1 > cj < cs+1
for j = 2, . . . , s then there is a line joining columns one and s + 1. So X(d) has an
entry in gs .
Corollary 4.6. For sln , s(d) is equal to one if and only if the dimension vector
satisfies d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dt ≥ · · · ≥ dr for some 1 ≤ t ≤ r.
   This well-known result has been observed by Lynch [L], Elashvili and Kac [EK],
Goodwin and Röhrle [GR], and in our joint work with Wallach [BW].
   The next lemma shows how to obtain the dual of the partition of X(d) if X(d)
is given by the appropriate line diagram for d.
Lemma 4.7. If p(d) is a simple parabolic subalgebra of a symplectic or orthogonal
Lie algebra let X = X(d) be given by the appropriate line diagram Leven (d) or
Lodd(d). The dual of the partition of X has the form

where Do := {di odd | di < dr+1 }, D := {di odd | di > dr+1 } and D := {di even |

    In particular, if Do , De or Do are empty, the partition in the corresponding case
(ii), (iv) or (v) has the same parts as the dimension vector. The same is true for
(iii), if there are no odd di .
   The proof consists mainly in counting lines and (sub)chains of lines of the corre-
sponding diagrams. Therefore we postpone it and include it in the appendix. We
are now ready to prove Theorem 4.4 with the use of Theorem 2.3 and of Lemma 4.7.
Proof of Theorem 4.4. We consider the case g = sp2n . For the parabolic subalge-
bras of an orthogonal Lie algebra, the claim follows using the same methods. The
idea is to use the dimension of the centralizer of X(d) and compare it to the di-
mension of the Levi factor. To calculate the dimension of the centralizer, we use
the formulae of Theorem 2.3, i.e. we use the dual of the partition of X = X(d) as
described in Lemma 4.7 and the number of odd parts in the partition of X.
sp2n , type (a):
By Lemma 4.7 the dual partition of the nilpotent element X = X(d) has as parts
the entries of d. Since they all appear in pairs, the partition of the orbit has no odd
entries. So by the formula of Theorem 2.3 we obtain dim gX = 21 (2d21 + · · · + 2d2r ),
                  RICHARDSON ELEMENTS FOR CLASSICAL LIE ALGEBRAS                          11


the same as the dimension of the Levi factor. In particular, X is a Richardson
element for the parabolic subalgebra p(d) of sp2n .
sp2n , type (b):
As in Lemma 4.7 let Do ⊂ {d1 , . . . , dr } be the possibly empty set of the odd di that
are smaller than dr+1 . Then the dual partition has the parts
             {di , di | i < r, di ∈
                                  / Do } ∪ {dr+1 } ∪ {di+1 , di−1 | di ∈ Do }.
The di that are not in Do come in pairs and do not contribute to odd parts in the
partition of X = X(d). In particular, the number of odd parts only depends on
dr+1 and on the entries of Do . We write the elements of Do in decreasing order as
d˜1 , . . . , d˜s (where s = |Do |). By assumption (the parabolic subalgebra is simple)
these odd entries are all different, d˜1 > d˜2 > · · · > d˜s . Then the number of odd
parts of the partition of X is the same as the number of odd parts of the dual of
the partition
                          P̃ : dr+1 , d˜1 + 1, d˜1 − 1, . . . , d˜s + 1, d˜s − 1.
This has dr+1 − (d˜1 + 1) ones, (d˜1 + 1) − (d˜1 − 1) twos, (d˜1 − 1) − (d˜2 + 1) threes,
and so on. So the number of odd parts in the dual of P̃ is
[dr+1 −(d˜1 +1)]+[(d˜1 −1)−(d˜2 +1)]+· · ·+[(d˜s−1 −1)−(d˜s +1)]+ d˜s −1 = dr+1 −2s.
Thus the dimension of the centralizer of X is

4.1. Bala Carter labels for Richardson orbits. The support of the nilpotent
element of a simple line diagram is by construction a simple system of root. Namely,
for any d, the corresponding X(d) has at most one non-zero element in each row
and each column. One can check that none of the corresponding positive roots
subtract from each other.
   In other words, the support supp(X) forms a simple system of roots.
Remark 4.8. The converse statement is not true. There are Richardson elements
whose support form a simple system of roots but where there is no simple line
diagram defining a Richardson element. A family of examples are the Borel subal-
gebras of so2n or more general, parabolic subalgebras of so2n where αn and αn−1
are both not roots of the Levi factor
  If X is a nilpotent element of g we denote the G-orbit through X by OX (where
G is the adjoint group of g).
Corollary 4.9. Let p(d) be a parabolic subalgebra of sln . Define X(d) by the line
diagram Lh (d) or a simple parabolic subalgebra of (b)-type for sp2n , soN Then the
group spanned by supp X(d) is equal to the Bala-Carter label of the G-orbit OX(d) .

Proof. This follows from the characterization of the type (i.e. the Bala-Carter label)
of OX given by Panyushev in Section 3 of [P].
   For simplicity we assume d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr . Note that in any case, the partition of
X(d) is given by the chains in the line diagram. The partition of X(d) has entry i
for every chain of length i + 1.
   If α given by Eij and β given by Ekl are roots of supp X(d) then they add to
a root of sln if and only if there is a line connecting them. Thus in the case of
the special linear Lie algebra a chain of length i + 1 corresponds to a factor Ai in
supp X(d). Similarly, for sp2n and soN , a chain of length i + 1 together with its
counterpart give a factor Ai . Finally, the possibly remaining single chain of length
2j + 1 (passing through the central vertex of column r + 1) in the case of so2n+1
gives a factor Bj . Then the claim follows with [P] where Panyushev describes the
type of a nilpotent orbit in terms of its partition.                                

                               5. Branched diagrams
   The diagrams we have introduced had at most one line to the left and at most
one line to the right of a vertex. We call such a diagram a simple line diagram.
In the case of simple parabolic subalgebras, we can always choose a simple line
diagram to define a Richardson element. However, there are parabolic subalgebras
where no simple diagram gives rise to a Richardson elements. After giving an ex-
ample we characterize the parabolic subalgebras for which there exists a simple line
diagram giving a Richardson element. Then we discuss the case of the symplectic
Lie algebras. We introduce a branched diagram and obtain a Richardson elements
for the parabolic subalgebra in question.
Example 4. 1) Consider the parabolic subalgebra of so2n given by the dimension
vector (n, n) where n is odd. The element X = X(n, n) given by the diagram
Leven (n, n) has rank n − 1 and so the kernel of the map X k has dimension n + 1
or 2n for k = 1, 2 resp. The partition of X is then 12 , 2n−1 , its dual is n − 1, n + 1.
The centralizer of X has dimension 2n2 + 1 − 1 and the Levi factor of this parabolic
subalgebra has dimension n2 . So X is a Richardson element.
   2) Let p ⊂ so4d be given by (d, d, d, d) where d is odd. Note that the skew-
symmetry of the orthogonal Lie algebra allows at most d − 1 lines between the two
central columns.

The line diagram Leven (d, d, d, d) has 2d + d − 1 lines, 2(d − 1) two-subchains and
d − 1 three-chains. Calculating the dimensions of the kernel of the map X k (where
X = X(d, d, d, d)) yields the partition 22 , 4d−1 . Its dual is (d − 1)2 , (d + 1)2 , hence
the centralizer of X has dimension 2d2 + 2 while the Levi factor has dimension 2d2 .
Theorem 5.1. Let g be a simple Lie algebra. The parabolic subalgebras p of g for
which there exists a simple line diagram that defines a Richardson element for p
are:
   The parabolic subalgebras of sln and the simple parabolic subalgebras of the sym-
plectic and orthogonal Lie algebras.
Proof. By Theorems 3.2 and 4.4 there is always a simple line diagram giving a
Richardson element in these cases. It remains to show that these are the only ones.
               RICHARDSON ELEMENTS FOR CLASSICAL LIE ALGEBRAS                          13


By Corollary 4.3 we can assume w.l.o.g. that d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr . Then it turns out that
if there is an even number of blocks for so2n or if dr ≤ dr+1 for sp2n the problem is
translated to the problem of finding a Richardson element in the first graded part
g1 of g because of the following observation: Since d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr = dr ≥ · · · ≥ d1 , or
d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr ≤ dr+1 ≥ dr ≥ · · · ≥ d1 all lines are connecting neighbored columns.
But lines connecting neighbored columns correspond to entries Ei,j of the first
super diagonal of the parabolic subalgebra, i.e. to entries of g1 . Then the claim
follows from the classification of parabolic subalgebras with a Richardson element
in g1 for type (a) of so2n and if dr ≤ dr+1 for type (b) parabolic subalgebras of the
symplectic Lie algebra. In both cases there exists a Richardson element in g1 if and
only if each odd block length di only appears once among d1 , . . . , dr , cf. [BW]. If
there is no Richardson element in g1 then in particular no simple line diagram can
give a Richardson element. It remains to deal with (b)-types for soN and (b)-types
for sp2n where dr+1 is not maximal. Both are straightforward but rather lengthy
calculation that we omit here.                                                          
   By way of illustration we include examples of branched diagrams for non-simple
parabolic subalgebras of sp2n and of soN in the appendix. In general, it is not
clear how branched diagrams should be defined uniformely for the symplectic and
orthogonal Lie algebras. It is clear from the description of simple parabolic subal-
gebras of soN that this case is more intricate. We assume that Richardson elements
can be obtained by adding lines to the corresponding simple line diagrams:
Conjecture 1. For the (b)-type of sp2n the appropriate diagram defining a Richard-
son element is obtained from Lodd(d) by adding a branching for every repetition
di = di+1 = · · · = di+s of odd entries smaller than dr+1 .
   We conclude this section with a remark on the bound s(d) introduced in Sec-
tion 4. If there is no simple line diagram defining a Richardson element, we can
still define s(d) to be the maximal number of a sequence of entries of d that are sur-
rounded by two larger entries. But this will now only be a lower bound, the Richard-
son element defined by a branched diagram does not necessarily lie in g1 ⊕· · ·⊕gs(d) ,
cf. Examples 5, 6, and 7.

                                              Appendix
    We discuss some examples of branched line diagrams for sp2n and for soN to
illustrate Section 5. Recall that the parabolic subalgebras of type (b) of sp2n are
simple if and only if every odd di < dr+1 only appears once among d1 , . . . , dr . In
particular, the smallest example of sp2n where there is no simple line exists for
n = 3.
Example 5. Let p be the parabolic subalgebra of sp6 with dimension vector
(1, 1, 2, 1, 1). Consider the diagrams

The diagram to the left is a line diagram as in Section 4. The corresponding
nilpotent element has a centralizer of dimension 7. However, the Levi factor is five
14                                        KARIN BAUR


dimensional. In the second diagram, there is one extra line, connecting the vertices
2 and 5. The defined matrix X = E12 +E23 +E25 −E45 −E56 has a five dimensional
centralizer as needed.
Example 6. The following branched line diagram for the parabolic subalgebra
of sp22 with dimension vector d = (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1) gives a Richardson
element for p(d)

The Levi factor and the centralizer of the constructed X have dimension 31.
Example 7. For the orthogonal Lie algebras, the smallest example are given by
d = (1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1), i.e. (a)-type of g = so8 and by d = (2, 2, 1, 2, 2) for an odd
number of blocks in so9 . The following branched diagrams give Richardson elements
for the corresponding parabolic subalgebras.

Proof of Lemma 4.7. We prove the statement for the symplectic Lie algebras. The
corresponding statements for soN are proven similarly.
(i) - Type (a) of sp2n :
Note that the bottom-top ordering of the second half of Leven (d) ensures that the
counterpart of a line i—j (for j ≤ n) is again horizontal and that all lines connecting
any entry of column r to an entry to its right are horizontal. Therefore the line
diagram Leven has the same shape as the horizontal line diagram defined for sln .
In particular, the orbit of the nilpotent element defined by Leven (d) has the same
partition as the one defined by Lh (d). Then the assertion follows with Lemma 3.3.
(ii) - Type (b) of sp2n :
The proof is done by induction on r. Let d = (d1 , d2 , d1 ) be the dimension vector.
If d1 ∈   / Do (i.e. d1 is not an odd entry smaller than d2 ) then the line diagram
Leven (d1 , d2 , d1 ) has the same chains of lines as the horizontal diagram for sl2n .
For d1 ∈ Do the diagram Leven (d1 , d2 , d1 ) has d1 − 1 two-chains (chains of length
two) and 2 one-chains (i.e. lines). So the kernel of the map X k has dimension d2 ,
d1 + d2 + 1, 2d1 + d2 for k = 1, 2, 3, giving the partition 1d2 −d1 −1 , 22 , 3d1 −1 and the
dual of it is d2 , d1 + 1, d1 − 1 as claimed.
    Let now d = (d1 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d1 ) with d1 ≤ · · · ≤ dr+1 . For d′ =
(d2 , . . . , dr , dr+1 , dr , . . . , d2 ) is ok. Let d1 be even. If d1 = dr+1 then the dia-
gram Lodd (d) is the same as Lh (d), the claim follows immediately. If d1 < dr+1 ,
the diagram Lodd (d) is obtained from Lodd(d′ ) by extending d1 (2r − 2)-chains
to 2r-chains. The kernels of the map X k satisfy dim ker X k = dim ker Y k for
                RICHARDSON ELEMENTS FOR CLASSICAL LIE ALGEBRAS                                15


k ≤ 2r − 1, dim ker X 2r = 2n − d1 = dim ker Y 2r + d1 and dim ker X 2r+1 = 2n =
dim ker Y 2r+1 + 2d1 where Y ∈ sp2n−2d1 is defined by the line diagram Leven (d′ ).
If the partition of Y is 1b1 , 2b2 , . . . , (2r − 1)b2r−1 then the partition of X is
               1b1 , . . . , (2r − 2)b2r−2 , (2r − 1)b2r−1 −d1 , (2r)0 , (2r + 1)d1 .
Thus the dual of this partition is the dual of the partition of Y together with the
parts d1 , d1 .
   If d1 is even and d1 > dr+1 , the diagram Lodd (d) is obtained from Lodd(d′ ) by
extending dr+1 (2r − 2)-chains to 2r-chains and by extending d1 − dr+1 (2r − 3)-
chains to (2r − 1)-chains. Here we get dim ker X k = dim ker Y k for k ≤ 2r −
2, dim ker X 2r−1 = dim ker Y 2r−1 + d1 − dr+1 , dim ker X 2r = 2n − dr + 1 =
dim ker Y 2r + 2d1 − dr+1 and dim ker X 2r+1 = 2n = dim ker Y 2r+1 + 2d1 . So
the partition of X can be calculated to be
1b1 , . . . , (2r−3)b2r−3 , (2r−2)b2r−2 −d1 +dr+1 , (2r−1)b2r−1 −dr+1 , (2r)d1 −dr+1 , (2r+1)dr+1
with b2r−1 = dr+1 . Again, the dual of the partition of X is obtained from the dual
of the partition of Y by adding d1 , d1 .
   Let d1 be odd and d1 > dr+1 . In particuar, there are no odd di that are smaller
than dr+1 . The shape of Lodd (d) is the same as the diagram for sl2n (i.e. they have
the same chain lengths). So the dual of the partition is just the dimension vector
and we are done. If d1 < dr+1 , the diagram Lodd (d) is obtained from Lodd(d′ ) by
extending d1 −1 (2r −2)-chains to 2r-chains and by extending two (2r −2)-chains to
(2r − 1)-chains. The calculations of the dimensions of the kernels for X (compared
to those for Y ) give as partition of X:
             1b1 , . . . , (2r − 2)b2r−2 , (2r − 1)b2r−1 −d1 −1 , (2r)2 , (2r + 1)d1 −1
Hence the dual of the partition of X is obtained from the dual of the partition of
Y by adjoining d1 + 1, d1 − 1.                                                  
