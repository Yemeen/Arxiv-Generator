                                                                                            λ be the Specht module over F Σ cor-
                                                    of characteristic distinct from 2. Let SF                              n
                                                    responding to the partition λ of n. We find the indecomposable components of
                                                    the restricted module SF λ ↓                               λ Σn+1 . Namely,
                                                                                 Σn−1 and the induced module SF ↑

                                                    the modules SF λ ↓               λ Σn+1 B are 0 or indecomposable. We give
                                                                       Σn−1 b and SF ↑

                                               Let n be a positive integer and let Σn be the symmetric group of degree n.
                                            For any field F and any partition λ of n, the Specht module SFλ is defined to be
                                            the submodule of the permutation module FΣλ ↑Σn spanned by certain elements
                                            called polytabloids, where Σλ is the Young subgroup associated to λ and FΣλ is the
                                            principal F Σλ -module. (See [1] for definitions.) Specht modules play a central role
                                            in the representation theory of the symmetric group, because in characteristic 0 the
                                            Specht modules are the simple F Σn -modules, while in characteristic p the heads of
                                            the Specht modules SFλ such that λ is p-regular are the simple F Σn -modules. When
                                            the field F has charactersitic 0, the structure of the restriction of SFλ to Σ
                                                                                                                         Ln−1 is
                                            given by the Classical Branching Rule: the module SFλ ↓Σn−1 is a direct sum µ SFµ ,
                                            where µ runs through all partitions of n − 1 obtained from λ by removing a node
                                            from its Young diagram. In 1971, Peel [4] gave the first characteristic p version of
                                            the branching rule. He showed that there is a series of submodules such that the
                                            successive quotients are the Specht modules SFµ , where µ runs through the same
                                            set. Nevertheless, the structure of the restriction SFλ ↓Σn−1 is not well understood.
                                            For example, the problem of finding a composition series is open and very difficult,
                                            and the socle is not known. See Kleshchev [2] for an introduction to recent work
                                            on SFλ ↓Σn−1 .
                                               In this paper, we find the indecomposable components of SFλ ↓Σn−1 , when the
                                            characteristic of F is not 2. These are given by Theorem 3.4: if b is a block
                                            idempotent of F Σn−1 , then SFλ ↓Σn−1 b is 0 or indecomposable. Thus there is
                                            a bijection between the set of indecomposable components of SFλ ↓Σn−1 and the
                                            set of p-cores that can be obtained from λ by removing first one node and then
                                            a sequence of rim p-hooks. We also prove the analogous theorem for the induced
                                            module SFλ ↑Σn+1 . The two proofs are almost identical. We give examples to show
                                            that the assumption char F 6= 2 cannot be dropped.
                                               The combinatorial part of the proof is in section 2. Here we find the minimal
                                            polynomials for the actions of En−1 on SFλ ↓Σn−1 and En+1 on SFλ ↑Σn+1 , where

Ek is the sum of all the transpositions in Σk . These polynomials have degrees m
and m + 1 respectively, where m is the number of distinct parts of λ. The results
of section 2 are valid for all fields, not just those of odd characteristic.
   In section 3, we investigate the algebras E = EndF Σn−1 (SFλ ↓Σn−1 ) and F =
EndF Σn+1 (SFλ ↑Σn+1 ). Under the assumption that char F 6= 2, we use the re-
sults from section 2 to show that the natural maps Z(F Σn−1 ) → E/J(E) and
Z(F Σn+1 ) → F /J(F ) are surjective, where J(E) and J(F ) are the Jacobson radi-
cals of E and F . The main theorem follows easily.

    2. The minimal polynomials of the sum of all transpositions acting
            on the restriction and induction of a Specht module
   Throughout this paper n is a fixed positive integer and λ is a fixed partition of
n. We orient the Young diagram [λ] left to right and top to bottom. This means
that the first row is the one at the top and the first column is the one at the left.
The (i, j) node is in the ith row and the jth column. We will use n    b to denote the
set {1, . . . , n} and let Σn denote the group of permutations of n
                                                                  b. Permutations and
homomorphisms will generally act on the right. The Murphy element Ln is the
sum of all transpositions in Σn that are not in Σn−1 (with L1 := 0). We use En to
denote the sum of all transpositions in Σn . So En is the 1-st elementary symmetric
function in the Murphy elements.
   Let F be any field and let S λ denote the Specht module, defined over F , corre-
sponding to λ. We use the notation
                      R    for the restriction of S λ to Σn−1 and
                       I   for the induction of S λ to Σn+1 .
The purpose of this section is to compute the minimal polynomial of En−1 acting
on R and the minimal polynomial of En+1 acting on I.
    We consider a λ-tableau to be a bijective map t : [λ] → n        b. The value of t at a
node (r, c) is denoted by trc . The group Σn acts on the set of all λ-tableaux by
functional composition; (tπ)rc = trc π, for each π ∈ Σn .
    Suppose that λ has l nonzero parts [λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λl ]. We regard a λ-tabloid
as an ordered partition P = (P1 , . . . , Pl ) of n
                                                  b such that the cardinality of Pu is λu ,
for u = 1, . . . , l. Each λ-tableau t determines the λ-tabloid {t} whose u-th part is
the set of entries in the u-th row of t. If s is a λ-tableau, then {t} = {s} if and only
if s = tπ, for some π in the row stabilizer Rt of t. We denote the column stabilizer
of t by Ct . We denote by M λ the F Σn -module consisting of all formal F -linear
combinations of λ-tabloids.
    Adapting the notation of James [1], let (r1 , c1 ), . . . , (rm , cm ) be the removable
nodes of [λ], ordered so that r1 < . . . < rm and c1 > . . . > cm . Set r0 = 0 = cm+1 .
The addable nodes of [λ] are the (m + 1) nodes (ru + 1, cu+1 + 1), for u = 0, . . . , m.
We use λ↓u to denote the partition of n − 1 obtained by decrementing the ru -th
part of λ by 1, for u ∈ m.  b In addition, we use λ↑u to denote the partition of n + 1
obtained by incrementing the (ru + 1)-th part of λ by 1, for u ∈ m         \ + 1.
    We need special notation for certain subsets of a λ-tableau t. For the rest of the
paper, suppose that λ has parts of m different nonzero lengths. For any u ∈ m,        b let
Hu (t) be the set of entries in the union of the top ru rows of t, and let Vu (t) be the
set of entries in the union of columns of t numbered from cu+1 + 1 to cu (inclusive).
Clearly H1 (t) ⊂ . . . ⊂ Hm (t), while Vm (t), . . . , V1 (t) forms a partition of t. Also

Vu (t) ⊆ Hv (t) if and only if u ≤ v. As Hu (t) depends only on the rows of t, we
may define Hu ({t}) := H(t).
   By Theorem 9.3 in [1], R has a Specht series
                             0 ⊂ R1 ⊂ R2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Rm = R,
with Ru /Ru−1 ∼
              =S     λ↓u
                           , for u ∈ m.
                                     b Also, by 17.14 in [1], I has a Specht series
                       I = I1 ⊃ I2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ Im+1 ⊃ Im+2 = 0,
with Iu /Iu+1 ∼
                    u
                               \
              = S λ↑ , for u ∈ m + 1. Each factor I/Iu+1 is isomorphic to a
                                        u
submodule of the permutation module M λ↑ .
Lemma 2.1. Suppose that the F Σn -module M has a Specht series 0 = M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂
. . . ⊂ Mm = M . Let z ∈ Z(F Σn ) and let u ∈ m.
                                              b Then there is a scalar zu in F
such that the map Mu /Mu−1 → Mu /Mu−1 given by multiplication by z is equal to
zu times the identity map.
Proof. If char F = 0, then Mu /Mu−1 is an irreducible F Σn -module (a Specht mod-
ule), and the conclusion is obvious. If char F = p is positive, then Mu /Mu−1 is
the p-modular reduction of an irreducible module defined over a suitable discrete
valuation ring of characteristic 0. The conclusion follows in this case from the
characteristic zero case.                                                      
  This lemma allows us to give the following upper bound on the degrees of the
minimal polynomials of En−1 and En+1 .
Corollary 2.2. The minimal polynomial of En−1 acting on R has degree at most
m, while the minimal polynomial of En+1 acting on I has degree at most m + 1.
Proof. Let u ∈ m. b Lemma 2.1 shows that Ru (En−1 − zuQ) ⊆ Ru−1 , for some scalar
zu . It follows from a simple inductive argument that R mu=1 (En−1 − zu ) = 0. A
similar argument deals with the action of En+1 on I.                           
    It will turn out that the polynomials given in the proof of Corollary 2.2 are
minimal. Before we prove this, we will identify the scalars zu in terms of Young
diagrams.
    The residue of a node (r, c) is the scalar (c − r)1F . We set E(λ) as the sum of
the residues of all nodes in [λ]. So E(λ) is the 1-st elementary symmetric function
                                                            Pl
in the residues. An easy calculation shows that E(λ) = i=1 21 λi (λi + 1 − 2i)1F .
The next lemma is a special case of a more general result proved by G. E. Murphy
[3]: 1-st elementary symmetric function can be replaced by any symmetric function
in n variables.
Lemma 2.3. En acts as the scalar E(λ) on S λ .
Proof. Let t be a λ-tableau, let (r, c) ∈ [λ] and let  P i = trc . Fix 1 ≤ c′ < c. Then
by a simple Garnir relation (section 7 of [1]), et j (i, j) = et , where j runs over
all entries in the c′ -th column of t. Also et (i, j) = −et , for each entry j above i in
column c of t. It follows that
                                   X
                                et     (i, j) = (c − r)et ,
                                     j

where j runs over those elements of nb that lie in t in columns strictly left of i or
in the same column as i but strictly above i. If we sum over all (r, c) ∈ [λ], each
4                         HARALD ELLERS AND JOHN MURRAY


transposition (i, j) occurs exactly once on the left hand side, while the coefficient
of et on the right hand side is E(λ).                                              

    If t is a λ-tableau, the polytabloid et is the following element of M λ :
                                        X
                                  et :=      sgn π{tπ}.
                                        π∈Ct

It is well known that the polytabloids span the Specht module S λ . James’ de-
scription of R, and the Garnir relations, show that et lies in Ru \Ru−1 if n ∈
Vu (t)\Hu−1 (t) (although we do not use this fact).
    We next describe the induced module I. Suppose that u ∈ m      \ + 1. Let T be a
   u
λ↑ -tableau, and let t denote the restriction of T to [λ]. Then the (λ, T )-polytabloid
                                     u
eλT is the following element of M λ↑ :
                                       X
                                eλT :=      sgn π{T π}.
                                        π∈Ct

In Section 17 of [1], James has shown that when u = m + 1, the corresponding
                                                         m+1
(λ, T )-polytabloids span an F Σn+1 -submodule of M λ↑       , which is isomorphic to
the induced module I. We will always work with this copy of I.
   When we are showing that the polynomials given in the proof of 2.2 are minimal,
it will be convenient to look at the action of the Murphy elements Ln and Ln+1
rather than En−1 and En+1 . The following lemma provides a link between these
actions. If t is a λ-tableau, its extension to [λ↑m+1 ] is the λ↑m+1 -tableau that is
obtained from t by appending n + 1 to the bottom of the first column.
Lemma 2.4. Let t be a λ-tableau and let T be its extension to [λ↑m+1 ]. Suppose
that f (x) ∈ F [x]. Then
                         et f (En−1 )   =      et f (E(λ) − Ln );
                        eλT f (En+1 )   = eλT f (E(λ) + Ln+1 ).

Proof. Lemma 2.3 shows that En acts as the scalar E(λ) on R. The first statement
then follows from En−1 = En − Ln .
                                     m+1
   Consider the subspace V of M λ↑        spanned by all eλU such that U is a λ↑m+1 -
tableau with n + 1 in the unique entry of its last row. The subspace V is a direct
summand of the restriction of I to Σn , and as an F Σn -submodule, V is clearly
isomorphic to S λ . Thus eλT lies in a direct summand of the restriction of I to Σn
that is isomorphic to S λ . So Lemma 2.3 shows that eλT En = E(λ)eλT . The second
statement now follows from En+1 = En + Ln+1 , and the fact that En Ln+1 =
Ln+1 En .                                                                         

   When we are showing that the polynomials given in the proof of 2.2 are minimal,
we will want to show that there is a λ-tableau t such that the set of vectors {et (Ln )i |
0 ≤ i ≤ m−1} is linearly independent. This will be accomplished using the following
technical lemma concerning the action of Ln on R.
Lemma 2.5. Let t be a λ-tableau such that n ∈ Vm (t)\Hm−1 (t). For each u ∈
\
m − 1, choose xu ∈ Vu (t)\Hu−1 (t). Set s = t (n, xm−1 , xm−2 , . . . , x1 ). Let i be a
positive integer with i ≤ m − 1. Then the coefficient of {s} in the expansion of

et (Ln )i into tabloids is
                                   0,   when 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 2;
                                      1, when i = m − 1.
                                   P
Proof. Clearly (Ln )i =              (wi , n)(wi−1 , n) . . . (w1 , n), where (w1 , . . . , wi ) ranges
over all functions bi → n[         − 1. Let (y1 , . . . , yi ) be a function bi → n[    − 1, let θ =
(yi , n)(yi−1 , n) . . . (y1 , n), and assume that {s} appears with nonzero coefficient in
the expansion of et θ. We have two goals: (a) to show that i = m − 1, and (b) to
show that when i = m − 1, the sequence (y1 , . . . , ym−1 ) is equal to the sequence
(x1 , . . . , xm−1 ). The second part P of the lemma follows easily from this second goal,
as we now show. In the sum               et (wi n) . . . (w1 n), {s} can appear in only one term,
namely et (xm−1 , n) . . . (x1 , n). Since this term is equal to et (n, xm−1 , xm−2 , . . . , x1 ) =
es , {s} appears with coefficient 1.
    Since et θ = etθ , there exists π in the column stabilizer of tθ such that {s} =
{t θ π}. Let u ∈ m       \ − 1. Then by construction xu ∈ Vu+1 (s)\Hu (s); since {s} =
{tθπ}, it follows that xu 6∈ Hu (t θ π). As π −1 is a column permutation of tθ, we
have xu ∈ Vu+1 (tθ) ∪ . . . ∪ Vm (tθ). Thus
(1)                        \
                      ∀u ∈ m − 1,        xu θ−1 ∈ Vu+1 (t) ∪ . . . ∪ Vm (t).
In particular, θ does not fix any of the m− 1 distinct symbols x1 , . . . , xm−1 ∈ n[           − 1.
    In this paragraph, we will show that θ does not fix n. Assume that θ does
fix n. If the symbols in the list y1 , . . . , yi were distinct, θ would be the cycle
(yi , yi−1 , . . . , y1 , n); since θ fixes n, it follows that there is some repetition in the
list y1 , . . . , yi . Since θ = (yi , n)(yi−1 , n) . . . (y1 , n) and θ fixes n, the only symbols
potentially moved by θ are on the list y1 , . . . , yi . Since this list contains a repeat, θ
moves at most i − 1 symbols. The previous paragraph shows that θ moves at least
m − 1 symbols. Therefore m ≤ i. But by hypothesis i ≤ m − 1. This contradiction
shows that θ moves n.
    We now know that θ moves all the m symbols in {x1 , . . . , xm−1 , n}. Since θ =
(yi , n)(yi−1 , n) . . . (y1 , n), θ can only move symbols on the list y1 , y2 , . . . , yi , n. By
hypothesis, i ≤ m − 1. It follows that i = m − 1, which is part (a) of our goal.
It also follows that the sets {x1 , . . . , xm−1 } and {y1 , . . . , ym−1 } coincide and that
the elements on the list y1 , y2 , . . . , ym−1 are distinct. Hence θ is equal to the m-
cycle (ym−1 , ym−2 , . . . , y1 , n). In particular, ym−1 θ−1 = n. From (1) applied with
u = m − 1, xm−1 θ−1 = n. (This is because n is the only symbol moved by θ that
is in Vm (t).) Hence ym−1 = xm−1 . From this fact and (1) applied with u = m − 2,
it follows that xm−2 θ−1 = xm−1 . Hence ym−2 = xm−2 . Continuing in this way, by
reverse induction on u, it follows that for all u ∈ m              \ − 1, yu = xu . This gives goal
(b) above, and completes the proof.                                                               

   The corresponding result for the action of Ln+1 on I is:
Lemma 2.6. Let t be a λ-tableau and let T be its extension to [λ↑m+1 ]. For each
u ∈ m,b choose xu ∈ Vu (t)\Hu−1 (t). Set S = T (n + 1, xm , xm−1 , . . . , x1 ). Let i
be a positive integer with i ≤ m. Then the multiplicity of {S} in the expansion of
eλT (Ln+1 )i into tabloids is
                                   0,   when 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1;
                                   1,   when i = m.

                                          P
Proof. Clearly we have (Ln+1 )i = (wi , n + 1)(wi−1 , n + 1) . . . (w1 , n + 1), where
(w1 , . . . , wi ) ranges over all functions bi → n
                                                  b. Let (y1 , . . . , yi ) be a function bi → n
                                                                                               b,
let θ = (yi , n + 1)(yi−1 , n + 1) . . . (y1 , n + 1), and assume that {S} appears with
nonzero multiplicity in the expansion of eλT θ as a linear combination of tabloids.
Then there exists π in the column stabilizer of tθ such that {S} = {T θ π}.
   As π fixes the single entry in the last row of T θ, and xm occupies this node in
S, it follows that (n + 1)θ = xm . Let u ∈ m        \  − 1 and let s denote the restriction
of S to λ. Then xu ∈ Vu+1 (s)\Hu (s), whence xu 6∈ Hu (t θ π). As π −1 is a column
permutation of tθ, we have xu ∈ Vu+1 (tθ) ∪ . . . ∪ Vm (tθ). Thus
(2)                           xu θ−1 ∈ Vu+1 (t) ∪ . . . ∪ Vm (t).
In particular, θ does not fix xu .
    From its definition, θ moves at most i + 1 elements of n[         + 1. But θ does not
fix any of the m + 1 distinct symbols n + 1, xm , . . . , x1 , and i ≤ m. So we must
have i = m. Together with (2), this implies that xu θ−1 ∈ {xu+1 , . . . , xm }. Reverse
induction on u shows that xu θ−1 = xu+1 . Thus θ coincides with the (m + 1)-cycle
(n+1, xm , xm−1 , . . . , x2 , x1 ). We conclude that xu = yu , for u ∈ m.
                                                                        b This shows that
θ occurs with multiplicity 1 in the expansion of (Ln+1 )m as a linear combination
of group elements, whence {S} appears with multiplicity 1 in the expansion of
                                                             m+1
eλT (Ln+1 )m as a linear combination of tabloids in M λ↑          .                    
    We can now prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 2.7. The minimal polynomial of En−1 acting on R is
                            Ym
                               (x − E(λ↓u )),
                                      u=1
while the minimal polynomial of En+1 acting on I is
                                      m+1
                                      Y
                                            (x − E(λ↑u )).
                                      u=1

Proof. First, we will prove the result on R. Let t be as in Lemma 2.5. Then Lemma
2.5 implies that the set of vectors {et (Ln )i | 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1} is linearly independent.
It follows from Lemma 2.4 that the set {et (En−1 )i | 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1} is linearly
independent. So the minimal polynomial of En−1 has         Qmdegree at least m. But
Lemma 2.3 and the proof of Corollary 2.2 show that R u=1 (En−1 − E(λ↓u )) = 0.
   The result on I follows from an identical argument using Lemma 2.6 in place of
Lemma 2.5.                                                                            

3. The indecomposable components of the restriction and induction
                        of a Specht module
   The purpose of this section is to compute the indecomposable components of
R and I, when the characteristic of F is not 2. It is convenient to consider an
F Σn -module M that shares the following properties in common with R and I:
    (1) M has a Specht series
                           0 = M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Mm = M,
          such that Mu /Mu−1 ∼  = S λu , where λu is a partition of n, for each u ∈ m.
                                                                                    b
      (2) The labelling partitions satisfy λ1 ⊳ . . . ⊳ λm .

   (3) There exists z ∈ Z(F Σn ) such that the minimal polynomial of z acting on
        M has degree m.
Looking
Qm       at the proof of Corollary 2.2, we see that z has minimal polynomial
  u=1 (x − zu ), where z acts as the scalar zu on the Specht factor Mu /Mu−1 .
                                                              Qm
Lemma 3.1. There exists τ ∈ M such that for all u ∈ m,   b τ i=u+1 (z − zi ) lies in
Mu \Mu−1 .
Proof. The hypothesis on the degree of the minimal polynomial of z implies that
there exists τ ∈ M such that Qτ z m−1 does not lie in the span of the vectors
                                            m
{τ, τ z, . . . , τ z m−2 }. Set τu = τ i=u+1 (z − zi ). Repeated application of Lemma
2.1 shows that τu ∈ Mu . We claim that τu 6∈ Mu−1 . Suppose otherwise. Then
   Q                                Qu−1
τuQ u−1
      i=1 (z − zu ) ⊆ Mu−1             i=1 (z − zu ) = 0, again using Lemma 2.1.  Thus
τ m i=1,i6=u    (z  − z i ) = 0. This contradicts our choice of τ .                 
   We now consider the endomorphism ring of a module that has properties (1) and
(2) in common with M .
Lemma 3.2. Suppose that char F 6= 2. Let θ be a F Σn -endomorphism of M . Then
   (1) for all u ∈ m,    b Mu θ ⊆ Mu ;
   (2) for all u ∈ m,    b there is a well-defined Σn -endomorphism θu : Mu /Mu−1 →
       Mu /Mu−1 given by (v + Mu−1 )θL        u = vθ + Mu−1 ;
   (3) the map Φ : EndF Σn (M ) →               u EndF Σn (Mu /Mu−1 ) given by (θ)Φ =
       (θ1 , . . . , θm ) is an algebra homomorphism;
  (4) the kernel of Φ is the Jacobson radical of EndF Σn (M ).
Proof. First, we prove (i). By induction, we may assume that Mu−1 θ ⊆ Mu−1 .
Suppose that Mu θ 6⊆ Mu . Choose v so that m ≥ v > u and v is maximal so that
Mu θ 6⊆ Mv−1 . Then Mu θ ⊆ Mv , and applying θ to elements of Mu induces a
well-defined nonzero Σn -homomorphism
                       Mu /Mu−1 → Mv /Mu−1 ։ Mv /Mv−1 .
But λu ⊳ λv . This, together with the fact that char F 6= 2, contradicts 13.17 of [1],
proving (i). Part (ii) follows easily from part (i).
   It is immediate from the definition of θu that Φ is an algebra homomorphism.
As char F 6= 2, the only Σn -endomorphisms of Mu /Mu−1 are scalar multiples of
the identity, by 13.17 of [1]. It follows that the codomain of Φ is commutative and
semisimple. Any element of the kernel must send Mu to Mu−1 for all u; therefore
the kernel is nilpotent.                                                            
  We now compute the indecomposable summands of M .
Proposition 3.3. Assume that char F 6= 2. Let B be a block idempotent of F Σn .
Then the F Σn -module M B is 0 or indecomposable.
Proof. Assume that M B 6= 0. Let A be the algebra EndF Σn (M B). Identify the
algebra A in the natural way with a direct summand of the algebra EndF Σn (M ).
We will use the notation and results from Lemma 3.2 throughout this proof. Our
goal is to show that A/J(A) has dimension 1 over F .
   Suppose then that θ ∈ A. Let w be maximal such that the Specht module
Mw /Mw−1 belongs to B. Our task is to show that if θw = 0, then θu = 0 for all u
such that Mu /Mu−1 belongs to B. (The proposition follows easily from this. Let φ
8                         HARALD ELLERS AND JOHN MURRAY


be in A. Then there is a scalar c such that the map φw is c times the identity. Let
θ = φ − c1A . Then θw = 0. Since θu is also 0 for all u with Mu /Mu−1 belonging
to B, it follows from the last part of Lemma 3.2 that θ ∈ J(A). Hence A/J(A) has
dimension 1.)
   Now assume that θw = 0, and let u be an integer  Qsuch  that Mu /Mu−1 belongs
                                                      m
to B. Let τ ∈ M be as in Lemma 3.1, set τu := τ i=u+1 (z − zi ), and set τw :=
  Qm
τ i=w+1 (z − zi ). The lemma states that τu ∈ Mu \Mu−1 and τw ∈ Mw \Mw−1.
Since u ≤ w, we have
                       w
                                    !
                      Y
          τu θ = τw        (z − zi ) θ
                       i=u+1
                        Yw
              = τw θ       (z − zi ),        as θ is in EndF Σn (M ),
                       i=u+1
                          Yw
              ∈ Mw−1            (z − zi ),     as θw = 0 implies that τw θ ∈ Mw−1 ,
                        i=u+1
                           w−1
                                             !
                           Y
              =    Mw−1           (z − zi ) (z − zw )
                          i=u+1
              ⊆ Mu (z − zw ),       using Lemma 2.1 repeatedly.
Now Mu /Mu−1 and Mw /Mw−1 both belong to B. So zu = zw , since both scalars
are equal to the image of z under the central character of B. Lemma 2.1 and the
last inclusion displayed above then show that τu θ ∈ Mu−1 . But τu 6∈ Mu−1 , as
proved in Lemma 3.1, and EndF Σn (Mu /Mu−1 ) is one-dimensional, by 13.17 of [1].
We conclude that θu = 0, as required.                                          
    We have now done all the work to prove the main result of this paper.
Theorem 3.4. Assume that char F 6= 2. Let b be a block idempotent of F Σn−1 .
Then the F Σn−1 -module (S λ ↓Sn−1 ) b is 0 or indecomposable. Let B be a block idem-
potent of F Σn+1 . Then the F Σn+1 -module (S λ ↑Sn+1 ) B is 0 or indecomposable.
Proof. We know that R and I satisfy properties (1) and (2) of M . That they also
satisfy property (3) is a consequence of Theorem 2.7. The result now follows from
Proposition 3.3.                                                                
    We will finish by giving examples to show that the assumption char F 6= 2 cannot
be dropped in Theorem 3.4.
    Assume that char F = 2. Consider the Specht module S (6,1,1,1) . The decompo-
sition matrix for Σ9 given in [1] shows that S (8,1) and S (6,3) are simple and that
S (6,1,1,1) has a composition series with factors S (8,1) and S (6,3) . By 23.8 in [1],
S (6,1,1,1) is self-dual, so there is another composition series in which the factors
appear in the other order. It follows that S (6,1,1,1) ∼   = S (8,1) ⊕ S (6,3) .
                                       (6,1,1,1)
    Now consider the restriction of S             to Σ8 . All components of the restriction
belong to the principal 2-block of Σ8 , which is the block with empty core. Since
S (6,1,1,1) is decomposable, so is its restriction to Σ8 .
    For the other counterexample, let M = S (6,1,1) ↑Σ9 . The module M has a
Specht series with factors S (7,1,1) , S (6,2,1) , and S (6,1,1,1) . These factors belong to
2-blocks with cores (1), (1), and (2, 1) respectively. It follows that if B is the

block idempotent corresponding to 2-core (2, 1), then M B ∼
                                                          = S (6,1,1,1) ; thus M B is
decomposable.
