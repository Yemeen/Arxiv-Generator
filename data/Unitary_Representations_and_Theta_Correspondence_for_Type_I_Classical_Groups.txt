                                                                                          Abstract

                                                   In this paper, we discuss the positivity of the Hermitian form (, )π introduced by Jian-
                                               Shu Li in [11]. Let (G1 , G2 ) be a type I dual pair with G1 the smaller group. Let π be
                                               an irreducible unitary representation in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ) (see [5]).
                                               We prove that the invariant Hermitian form (, )π is positive semidefinite under certain re-
                                               strictions on the size of G2 and a mild growth condition on the matrix coefficients of π.
                                               Therefore, if (, )π does not vanish, θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is unitary.

                                               Theta correspondence over R was established by Howe in ( [7]). Li showed that theta
                                               correspondence preserves unitarity for dual pairs in stable range. Our results generalize the
                                               results of Li for type I classical groups ( [11]). The main result in this paper can be used to
                                               construct irreducible unitary representations of classical groups of type I.


                                               1     Introduction
                                               Let (G1 , G2 ) be an irreducible reductive dual pair of type I in Sp (see [8] [11]). The dual
                                               pairs in this paper will be considered as ordered. For example, the pair (O(p, q), Sp2n (R))
                                               is considered different from the pair (Sp2n (R), O(p, q)). We will in general assume that the
                                               size of G1 (V1 ) is less or equal to the size of G2 (V2 ). In other words, dimD (V1 ) ≤ dimD (V2 ).
                                               Let M p be the unique double covering of Sp. Let {1, ǫ} be the preimage of the identity
                                               element in Sp. For a subgroup H of Sp, let M H be the preimage of H under the double
                                               covering. Whenever we use the notation M H, H is considered as a subgroup of certain
                                               Sp. Let ω(M G1 , M G2 ) be a Schrödinger model of the oscillator representation of M p. The
                                               Harish-Chandra module of ω(M G1 , M G2 ) consists of polynomials multiplied by the Gaus-
                                               sian function.

                                               Since the pair (G1 , G2 ) is ordered, we use θ(M G1 , M G2 ) to denote the theta correspon-
                                               dence from R(M G1 , ω(M G1 , M G2 )) to R(M G2 , ω(M G1 , M G2 ) (see [7]). In this paper,
                                               whenever we talk about ”K-finite matrix coefficients” or ”K-finite vectors” of a represen-
                                               tation π of a real reductive group G, ”K” is used as a generic term for a specified maximal
                                               compact subgroup of G. Throughout this paper, we will mainly work within the category of
                                               Harish-Chandra modules. A representation of a real reductive group refers to an admissible

                                                                                               1
representation unless stated otherwise. Throughout this paper, a vector in an admissible
representation π means that v is in the Harish-Chandra module of π which shall be evident
within the context.

Let V be a vector space of finite dimension. Let W be a subspace of V . A direct complement
of W in V is a subspace U such that

                                           U ⊕ W = V.

Now suppose V is equipped with a nondegenerate sesquilinear form (, ). The orthogonal
complement of W in V consists of

                                {v ∈ V | (v, w) = 0 ∀ w ∈ W }.

It is denoted by W ⊥ .

Let π be an irreducible admissible representation of M G1 such that π(ǫ) = −1. π is
said to be in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ) if the function

       (ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃1 )φ, ψ)(u, π(g̃1 )v)       (∀ φ, ψ ∈ ω(M G1 , M G2 ); ∀ u, v ∈ π)

is in L1−δ (M G1 ) for all sufficiently small nonnegative δ (i.e., δ ∈ [0, c] for some c > 0). We
denote the semistable range by Rs (M G1 , ω(M G1 , M G2 )). Suppose from now on that π is
in Rs (M G1 , ω(M G1 , M G2 )). For each φ, ψ ∈ ω(M G1 , M G2 ) and u, v ∈ π, we define an
averaging integral        Z
                                (ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃1 )φ, ψ)(u, π(g̃1 )v)dg̃1
                          MG1

and denote it by (φ⊗v, ψ⊗u)π . Thus (, )π becomes a real bilinear form on ω(M G1 , M G2 )⊗π.
Our definition of (, )π differs slightly from the original definition of Li in [11]. Let g̃2 ∈
M G2 act on ω(M G1 , M G2 ) ⊗ π by ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃2 ) ⊗ Id. In [5], we show that if
(, )π 6= 0 then (, )π descends into a sesquilinear form on the K-finite dual representation of
θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π). For π unitary, (, )π is an invariant Hermitian form on θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π).

For π unitary, a conjecture of Li says that (, )π will always be positive semidefinite (see
[11]). If Li’s conjecture holds and (, )π 6= 0, then θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is unitary. In this pa-
per, we will prove that (, )π is positive semidefinite under certain restrictions. This partly
confirms the conjecture of Li. The nonvanishing of certain (, )π is proved in [4] and in [6].

We adopt the notations from [11], [5], [12]. Let (G1 (V1 ), G2 (V2 )) be a dual pair of
type I. Suppose V2 = V20 ⊕ V2′ such that
  1. (, )2 restricted onto V20 is nondegenerate;
  2. V2′ = (V20 )⊥ ;
  3. V20 is a direct sum of two isotropic subspaces:

                                             V20 = X20 ⊕ Y20 .

Obviously, V20 will always be of even dimension. Let X 0 = Hom D (V1 , X20 ). The oscillator
representation ω(M G1 (V1 ), M G2 (V20 )) can be modeled on L2 (X 0 ). The action of M G1

                                                  2
on L2 (X 0 ) is equivalent to the regular action of G1 on L2 (X 0 ) tensoring with a unitary
character ξ of M G1 . The generic actions of G1 on X 0 are classified abstractly in Theorem
4.1 and Theorem 4.2.

Later in this paper, the oscillator representation ω(M G1 (V1 ), M G2 (V20 )) is denoted as
ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) to indicate the fact that M G1 (V1 ) in (M G1 (V1 ), M G(V2 )) might be dif-
ferent from M G1 (V1 ) in (M G1 (V1 ), M G2 (V20 )). For the same reason, the oscillator repre-
sentation ω(M G1 (V1 ), M G2 (V2′ )) is denoted by ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ).
Theorem 1.1 (Main Theorem) Let (G1 , G2 ) be a dual pair. Let Ξ(g) be Harish-Chandra’s
basic spherical function of G1 . Suppose π is an irreducible unitary representation of M G1
such that π(ǫ) = −1. Suppose
  1. for any x, y ∈ G1 , the function Ξ(xgy) is integrable on G1 φ for every generic φ ∈
     HomD (V1 , X20 ) (see Definition 4.1);
  2. the tensor product π0 = ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ) ⊗ π ⊗ ξ, considered as a representation of G1 ,
     is weakly contained in L2 (G1 ) (see [15]).
Then (, )π is positive semidefinite. If (, )π does not vanish, then θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is unitary.
Remarks:
  1. ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )), π and ξ are all projective representations of G1 . The fact that π0
     becomes a unitary representation of G1 is explained in Part II.
  2. The first condition roughly requires that
                                                       dimD (V1 )
                                       dimD (X20 ) >              .
                                                          2
     The precise statement depends on the groups involved. The function Ξ(g)|G1 φ is in
     L1 (G1φ ) implies that Ξ(xgy)|G1 φ is in L1 (G1φ ) for any x, y ∈ G1 and vice versa. In
     fact, Ξ(g) is bounded by a multiple of Ξ(xgy) and vice versa. Furthermore, for any
     compact subset Y of G1 , there exists a constant C, such that for any x, y ∈ Y ,

                                    Ξ(xgy) ≤ CΞ(g)          (g ∈ G1 ).                        (1)

     One can prove this by studying the compact picture of the basic spherical principle
     series representation (see Chapter VII.1 [9]). Since this remark may have already
     been in the literature and a proof will incur a new set of notations, we choose not to
     give the proof.
  3. The growth of matrix coefficients of ω(M G1 (V1 ), M G2 (V2′ )) can be determined easily.
     Thus the second condition can be converted into a growth condition on the matrix
     coefficients of π (see Corollary 5.1).
  4. The condition 1 and 2 imply that π is in Rs (M G1 , ω(M G1 , M G2 )). Therefore, (, )π is
     an invariant Hermitian form on θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π). The unitarity of θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π)
     follows since (, )π is positive semidefinite.
This paper is organized as follows. In Part I, we prove some positivity theorems in the sense
of Godement [3]. In Part II, we construct the dual pair (G1 , G2 ) in terms of homomorphisms
and study various subgroups and liftings concerning the tensor decomposition

                   ω(M G1 , M G2 ) ∼
                                   = ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ).

                                                 3
This tensor decomposition is termed as the mixed model in [11]. The interpretation of
this tensor product is not completely trivial since M G1 , M 0 G1 and M ′ G1 may be different
double coverings of G1 . In Part II, we essentially redo part of section 4 in [11] just to be
safe. In Part III, we study (ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ), L2 (X 0 )) and classify all the generic G1 -orbits
in X 0 . This enables us to reduce our averaging integral (φ ⊗ u, φ ⊗ u)π to an integral on
G1 -orbits:         Z         Z Z
                                         φ(g −1 x)φ(x)(u, π0 (g)u)dxdgd[O].
                      O∈G1 \X 0    G1   x∈O

We study each generic orbit integral
                         Z Z
                                    φ(g −1 x)φ(x)(u, π0 (g)u)dxdg
                              G1    x∈O

in full generality and convert it into an integral on the isotropic group G1 x
                                     Z
                                          (π0 (g)u0 , u0 )dg.
                                          G1 x

Next, we apply the positivity theorem (Theorem 2.3) to show that this integral is nonneg-
ative. Thus (, )π is positive semidefinite. Finally, we take the pair (O(p, q), Sp2n (R)) as an
example and state our main theorem in terms of leading exponents of π.

2     Part I: Positivity Theorems
Let G be a real reductive Lie group. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G. For any
unitary representation (π, H) of G and any σ ∈ K̂, let Hσ be the K-isotypic subspace of
H. Let S be a subset of K̂. We denote

                                                 ⊕σ∈S Hσ

by H(S).

2.1    A generic Theorem
 Theorem 2.1 Let G be a real reductive Lie group. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup
 of G. Let Ξ(g) be Harish-Chandra’s basic spherical function with respect to K. Let H
 be a closed unimodular Lie subgroup of G. Suppose that Ξ(g)|H is in L1 (H). Let φ be a
                                2+ǫ
Rpositive definite function in L (G)(S) for some finite subset S of K̂ and any ǫ > 0. Then
  H
    φ(h)dh ≥ 0.

Here L2+ǫ (G)(S) is defined with respect to the left regular action of G.

Proof: By the GNS construction, we construct a unitary representation (σ, H) such that
φ(g) = (σ(g)η, η) for some cyclic vector η in H(S). Since φ is a positive definite function in

                                                    4
L2+ǫ (G) for any ǫ > 0, by Theorem 1 in [1], σ is weakly contained in L2 (G). Thus, there
exists a sequence of convex linear combinations of diagonal matrix coefficients of L2 (G)(S)

such that

uniformly on compacta. Let Cc (G)(S) be the space of continuous and compactly sup-

ported functions in L2 (G)(S). Since Cc (G)(S) is dense in L2 (G)(S), we choose ui to be
in Cc (G)(S). Notice that

Hence {Ai (e)}∞
              i=1 is a bounded set. Suppose Ai (e) ≤ C. From Theorem 2 in [1],

We have proved that φ(g) can be approximated by positive definite functions Ai (g) such
that Ai (g) are uniformly bounded by a fixed multiple of Ξ(g).
                                                                                                         (l)   (l)

Thus H Ai (h)dh ≥ 0. But Ai (g)|H are bounded by a fixed multiple of an integrable function

2.2     First Variation
Theorem 2.2 Let G be a real reductive Lie group. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup
of G. Let H be a closed unimodular Lie subgroup of G. Let Ξ(g) be the basic spherical
function of G of Harish-Chandra. Suppose that Ξ(g)|H is in L1 (H). Suppose (π, H) is an
irreducible unitary representation weakly contained in L2 (G) (see [1]). Let
                                             k Z

where
   • u is a K-finite vector in H;
   • M is a smooth manifold;
   • φi is continuous and is supported on a compact set Xi ⊂ M ;
   • γi : M → G is smooth except a codimension 1 subset and the closure of γi (Xi ) is
     compact.
Then                                         Z
                                                   (π(h)v, v)dh ≥ 0.
                                              H

The basic idea is to control the function (π(g)v, v) by a convergent integral of left and right
translations of Ξ(g).

Proof: From the proof of Theorem 2.1, we have a sequence of K-finite compactly sup-
ported continuous positive definite functions

                                             Am (g) → (π(g)u, u)

uniformly on any compact subset and

                                              |Am (g)| ≤ CΞ(g).

This implies that
                                          |Am (xgy)| ≤ CΞ(xgy).
By the compactness of supp(φi ) and the unitarity of π,

Since the closure of γi (Xi ) is compact, the closure of γj (Xj )−1 gγi (Xi ) is compact for every

Since ui are K-finite, V is a finite dimensional representation of K. Let u be a K-cyclic

3     Part II: Dual Pairs and Mixed Model
The basic theory on the mixed model of the oscillator representation is covered in [11] with
reference to an unpublished note of Howe. We redo part of section 4 of [11] with emphasis
on the actions of various coverings of G1 regarding the mixed model
                     ω(M G1 , M G2 ) ∼
                                     = ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ).
Let V1 be a vector space over D equipped with a sesquilinear form (, )1 , V2 be a vector
space over D equipped with a sesquilinear form (, )2 . Suppose one sesquilinear form is ♯-
Hermitian and the other is ♯-skew Hermitian. Let Gi be the isometry group of (, )i . Let
V = HomD (V1 , V2 ) be the space of D-linear homomorphisms from V1 to V2 .

3.1    Setup
Let φ, ψ ∈ V , v1 , u1 ∈ V1 and v2 ∈ V2 . We define a unique φ∗ (v2 ) such that
                                      (φ∗ (v2 ), v1 )1 = (v2 , φ(v1 ))2 .
It is easy to verify that φ∗ ∈ HomD (V2 , V1 ). Thus we obtain a ∗ operation from V to
V ∗ = HomD (V2 , V1 ). Let a ∈ R. Then
      ((aφ)∗ (v2 ), v1 )1 = (v2 , aφ(v1 ))2 = a(v2 , φ(v1 ))2 = a(φ∗ (v2 ), v1 )1 = (aφ∗ (v2 ), v1 )1 .
Therefore, the ∗-operation is real linear.

Let tr(∗) be the real trace of a real linear endomorphism. Since V and V ∗ are real vector
spaces, we can now define a real bilinear form Ω on V as follows
                                           Ω(φ, ψ) = tr(ψ ∗ φ).
We observe that
(ψ ∗ φ(v1 ), v1′ )1 = (φ(v1 ), ψ(v1′ ))2 = ±(ψ(v1′ ), φ(v1 ))♯2 = ±(φ∗ ψ(v1′ ), v1 )♯1 = −(v1 , φ∗ ψ(v1′ ))1 .
Define a ∗-operation on EndD (V1 ) by
                        (A∗ u1 , v1 )1 = (u1 , A(v1 ))1       (∀ A ∈ EndD (V1 )).
          ∗   ∗        ∗
Then, (φ ψ) = −ψ φ. It follows that
                   Ω(ψ, φ) = tr(φ∗ ψ) = tr((φ∗ ψ)∗ ) = tr(−ψ ∗ φ) = −Ω(φ, ψ).
It is easy to verify that Ω is nondegenerate. Therefore, Ω is a real symplectic form on V .

Next we define the action of G1 on V as follows
                                         (g1 φ)(v1 ) = φ(g1−1 v1 ).
We observe that
                                        ((g1 ψ)∗ (g1 φ)(u1 ), v1 )1
                                       =((g1 φ)(u1 ), (g1 ψ)(v1 ))2
                                       =(φ(g1−1 u1 ), ψ(g1−1 v1 ))2                                        (6)
                                       =(ψ φ(g1−1 u1 ), g1−1 v1 )1
                                             ∗

                                       =(g1 (ψ ∗ φ)g1−1 u1 , v1 )1 .

                                                      9
It follows that

            Ω(g1 φ, g1 ψ) = tr((g1 ψ)∗ (g1 φ)) = tr(g1 ψ ∗ φg1−1 ) = tr(ψ ∗ φ) = Ω(φ, ψ).

Therefore G1 is in Sp(V, Ω). We define the action of G2 on V similarly by

                                       (g2 φ)(v1 ) = g2 φ(v1 ).

One can verify that G2 also preserves Ω. In addition, the action of G1 commutes with the
action of G2 .

3.2    Subgroups
Let V20 be a D-linear subspace of V2 such that
   • (, )2 restricted to V20 is nondegenerate;
   • There exist isotropic subspaces X20 and Y20 such that

                                             X20 ⊕ Y20 = V20

Let V2′ be the space of vectors perpendicular to V20 with respect to (, )2 . Write

                       X 0 = HomD (V1 , X20 ),          Y 0 = HomD (V1 , Y20 ),

                        V ′ = HomD (V1 , V2′ ),        V 0 = HomD (V1 , V20 ).
For any φ, ψ ∈ X 0 ,

                       (ψ ∗ φv1 , u1 )1 = (φv1 , ψu1 )2 = 0       (v1 , u1 ∈ V1 ).

Thus Ω(ψ, φ) = tr(φ∗ ψ) = 0. X 0 is an isotropic subspace of (V, Ω). For the same reason,
Y 0 is also an isotropic subspace of (V, Ω). Furthermore, we have

                               V = V ′ ⊕ V 0,          V 0 = X 0 ⊕ Y 0.

Let G02 be the subgroup of G2 such that G02 restricted to V2′ is trivial. Then G02 is isomorphic
to G2 (V20 ). Let G′2 be the subgroup of G2 such that G′2 restricted to V20 is trivial. Then G′2
is isomorphic to G2 (V2′ ).

Let Ω0 be the restriction of Ω on V 0 . Let Ω′ be the restriction of Ω on V ′ . Then Sp(V 0 , Ω0 )
and Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) can be embedded into Sp(V, Ω) diagonally. Let GL(X 0 , Y 0 ) be the subgroup
of Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) stabilizing X 0 and Y 0 . Since G1 and G02 act on V 0 , we obtain a dual pair

                                     (G1 , G02 ) ⊆ Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ).

We denote this embedding by i0 . On the other hand, since G1 and G′2 act on V ′ , we obtain
another dual pair
                                 (G1 , G′2 ) ⊆ Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ).
We denote this embedding by i′ . Now the group G1 is embedded into Sp(V, Ω) by i0 × i′ .
We denote this embedding by i.



                                                  10
3.3     Metaplectic Covering and Compatibility
For any symplectic group Sp, there is a unique double covering M Sp. We call this the
metaplectic covering. Let ǫ be the nonidentity element in M Sp whose image is the identity
element in Sp. For any subgroup G of Sp, let M G be the preimage of G under the meta-
plectic covering. Then every M G contains ǫ.

Let M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ), M ′ Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) and M Sp(V, Ω) be the metaplectic coverings of Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ),
Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) and Sp(V, Ω) respectively. Let M 0 , M ′ and M be the covering maps respectively.
When we consider Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) as a subgroup of Sp(V, Ω), we obtain a group M Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ).
On the other hand, Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) has its own metaplectic covering, namely, M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ).

Lemma 3.1 (compatibility) The group M Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) is isomorphic to M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ).

Proof: It suffices to show that M Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) does not split. Suppose M Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) splits.
Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of Sp(V, Ω) such that K 0 = K ∩ Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) is a
maximal compact subgroup of Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ). Then M K 0 splits. On the other hand, K can
be identified with a unitary group U . The metaplectic covering of U can be represented by

                                       {(ξ, g) | ξ 2 = det g, g ∈ U }

For the subgroup K 0 , we see that M K 0 must be the nontrivial double covering of K 0 . It
does not split. We reach a contradiction. Q.E.D.

This Lemma basically asserts that if a smaller symplectic group is embedded in a big-
ger symplectic group canonically, then the metaplectic covering on the smaller group is
compatible with the metaplectic covering on the bigger group. Let

                                i˜0 : (M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) ⊆ M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 )

be the lifting of i0 . Let
                                  i˜′ : (M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ) ⊆ M ′ Sp(V ′ , Ω′ )
be the metaplectic lifting of i′ . Let

                                     ĩ : (M G1 , M G2 ) ⊆ M Sp(V, Ω)

be the lifting of i. According to the compatibility lemma, we may consider M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 )
and M ′ Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) as subgroups of M Sp(V, Ω). These two subgroups intersect. The inter-
section is {1, ǫ}.

Consider the natural multiplication map

                        j : M 0 Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) × M ′ Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) → M Sp(V, Ω).

Its kernel is {(1, 1), (ǫ, ǫ)}. If g ∈ G1 , then

                   i(g) = (i0 (g), i′ (g)) ∈ Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) × Sp(V ′ , Ω′ ) ⊆ Sp(V, Ω)

The covering group M G1 is then isomorphic to the quotient

          {j(g 0 , g ′ ) | g 0 ∈ M 0 G1 , g ′ ∈ M ′ G1 , M 0 (g 0 ) = g = M ′ (g ′ )}/{(1, 1), (ǫ, ǫ)}.


                                                      11
Lemma 3.2 Each element in M G1 can be expressed as j(g 0 , g ′ ) with
                             (g 0 ∈ M 0 G1 , g ′ ∈ M ′ G1 , M 0 (g 0 ) = M ′ (g ′ ))
up to a factor of
                                                {(1, 1), (ǫ, ǫ)}.
Lemma 3.3 As a group,
          M 0 G1 ∼
                 = {(g, g ′ ) | M (g) = M ′ (g ′ ), g ∈ M G1 , g ′ ∈ M ′ G1 }/{(1, 1), (ǫ, ǫ)}.

3.4    Oscillator Representation as tensor product
Theorem 3.1 The representation
                                  ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )
restricted to
                    {j(g 0 , g ′ ) | g 0 ∈ M 0 G1 , g ′ ∈ M ′ G1 , M 0 (g 0 ) = g = M ′ (g ′ )}
descends into ω(M G1 , M G2 )|MG1 .
Proof: Suppose g ∈ M G1 . Then g can be written as
                        (g 0 , g ′ ) | g 0 ∈ M 0 G1 , g ′ ∈ M ′ G1 , M 0 (g 0 ) = M ′ (g ′ )
up to a multiplication by
                                                {(1, 1), (ǫ, ǫ)}.
It is easy to see that
           ω(M G1 , M G2 )(1, 1) = id = ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )(ǫ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )(ǫ)
It follows that
                ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g) = ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )(g 0 ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )(g ′ )
Our theorem is proved. Q.E.D.

Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of M G1 in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 )
such that π(ǫ) = −1. Identify the representation ω(M G1 , M G2 )c ⊗ π with
                            ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )c ⊗ (ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π).
From Lemma 3.3, g 0 ∈ M 0 G1 can be represented by a pair (g̃, g ′ ) up to a multiplication of
(ǫ, ǫ). Since
                            ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c (ǫ)π(ǫ) = id,
we can write
                   (ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π)(g 0 ) = ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c (g ′ ) ⊗ π(g).
The proof of Theorem 3.1 shows that
                                           ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π
can be regarded as a unitary representation of M 0 G1 .

3.5      Schrödinger Model of ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )
Recall V 0 = X 0 ⊕ Y 0 and both X 0 , Y 0 are Lagrangian in (V 0 , Ω0 ). Let GL(X 0 , Y 0 ) be the
subgroup of Sp(V 0 , Ω0 ) stabilizing X 0 and Y 0 . Then

                                    GL(X 0 , Y 0 ) ∼
                                                   = GL(X 0 ) ∼
                                                              = GL(Y 0 ).

Let L2 (X 0 ) be a Schrödinger model of ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) (see [5], [14]). The group
M 0 GL(X 0 , Y 0 ) acts on L2 (X 0 ) naturally. Since G1 is a subgroup of GL(X 0 , Y 0 ), an ele-
ment in the group M 0 G1 can be written as

                                               (ξ, g) | g ∈ G1 , ξ ∈ C

such that the operator

               (ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )(ξ, g)φ)(x) = ξφ(g −1 x)               (x ∈ X 0 , φ ∈ L2 (X 0 ))

is unitary.

Consider
           Z
                       (ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )(ξ, g)φ, ψ)(u, (ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π)(ξ, g)v)dgdξ     (7)
              M 0 G1

with u, v ∈ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ) ⊗ π. Since the group action of G1 on L2 (X 0 ) is already unitary,
ξ is a unitary character of M 0 G1 . Thus ξ ⊗ ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) can be viewed as a unitary
representation of G1 . Moreover,

                                 ξω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )(g, ξ)φ(x) = φ(g −1 x).

Define
                                     π0 = ξ ⊗ (ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π).
Viewing (ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π) as a representation of M 0 G1 , π0 descends into a unitary
representation of G1 .

Tensor products with ξ here do not change the ambient spaces. However, the group ac-
tions differ by a unitary character. Now, the integral ( 7) becomes a multiple of
                            Z Z
                                     φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)dx(u, π0 (g)v)dg.               (8)

4     Part III: Orbital Integrals
Recall that X 0 = HomD (V1 , X20 ). We need to classify the orbital structure of the G1 -action
on X 0 . Let m = dimD V1 and dimD X20 = p. If m ≤ p, (G1 , G2 ) is said to be in the stable
range. The action of G1 on X 0 is almost free. This case is already treated in [11]. For
(G1 , G2 ) in the stable range, our approach can be simplified and in deed coincides with Li’s
approach in [11]. From now on, assume m ≥ p. The set of nonsurjective homomorphisms
from V1 to X20 is of measure zero. Hence we will focus on surjective homomorphisms in X 0 .
We denote the set of surjective homomorphisms by X00 . Let φ ∈ X00 .

4.1     The Isotropic subgroup G1φ
Let e1 , e2 , . . . , em be a D-linear basis for V1 , and f1 , f2 , . . . , fp be a D-linear basis for X20 .
Then φ is uniquely determined by

                                        φ(e1 ), φ(e2 ), . . . , φ(em ).

We will determine the ”generic” isotropic subgroups of the G1 -action on X00 . Suppose
g ∈ G1 stabilizes φ. In other words,

                               φ(u) = (gφ)(u) = φ(g −1 u)                 (∀ u).

This implies that ker(φ) is stabilized by g. Therefore ker(φ)⊥ is also stabilized by g.
Lemma 4.1 Let g ∈ G1 and φ ∈ X00 . Then φ is fixed by g if and only if any vector in
ker(φ)⊥ is fixed by g.
Proof: Suppose φ is fixed by g. Let (v, ker φ)1 = 0. We choose an arbitrary u ∈ V1 .
Since φ(g −1 u) = φ(u), g −1 u − u ∈ ker φ. This implies that (v, g −1 u − u)1 = 0. Thus
(gv, u)1 = (v, u)1 for every u ∈ V1 . It follows that gv = v. g fixes every vector in v ∈ ker φ⊥ .

Conversely, suppose gv = v for any (v, ker φ) = 0. We choose an arbitrary u ∈ V1 . Then
(gv − v, u)1 = 0. Hence (v, g −1 u − u)1 = 0 for every v ∈ ker φ⊥ . From the nondegeneracy
of (, )1 ,
                               g −1 u − u ∈ (ker φ⊥ )⊥ = ker φ
Therefore, φ(g −1 u − u) = 0 for every u ∈ V1 . It follows that gφ = φ. Q.E.D.

Theorem 4.1 Let φ be a surjective homomorphism from V1 to X20 . Then the isotropic
subgroup G1 φ is the subgroup that fixes all vectors in ker(φ)⊥ .

The restriction of (, )1 onto ker φ⊥ contains a null space, namely,

                                          W = ker φ ∩ ker φ⊥ .                                          (9)

W is an isotropic subspace of V1 and it may or may not be trivial. Let U be a direct
complement of W in ker φ⊥ , i.e.,

                                            U ⊕ W = ker φ⊥ .                                           (10)

Then (, )1 restricted to U is nondegenerate. Thus (, )1 restricted onto U ⊥ is a nondegenerate
sesquilinear form. Since the group G1 φ fixes all vectors in ker φ⊥ and U ⊆ ker φ⊥ , G1 φ can

                                                     14
be identified with the subgroup of G1 (U ⊥ that fixes all vectors in W .

From Equations 9, 10, ker φ is the orthogonal complement of W in U ⊥ . From Equa-
tions (28),(29) in [11], G1 φ is a twisted product of G1 (ker φ/W ) with a at most two-step
nilpotent group N .
Theorem 4.2 For orthogonal groups, we take G1 = SO(p, q). The isotropic subgroup G1 φ
is a twisted product of a classical group of the same type with a at most two-step nilpotent
group N . It is always unimodular.
Proof: To show that G1 φ is unimodular, one must show that the adjoint action of G1 (ker φ/W )
on the Lie algebra n has determinant 1. This is obvious since n as a G1 -module decomposes
into direct sum of of trivial representations and the standard representations. Q.E.D.

4.2    Generic Element
The homomorphism φ induces an isomorphism
                                    [φ] : V1 / ker φ → X20
Notice that ker φ can be regarded as a point in the Grassmannian G(m, m − p). We obtain
a fibration
                              GLp (D) → X00 → G(m, m − p).
The projection maps φ to ker φ. The fiber contains all isomorphisms from V1 / ker φ to X20 .
Thus the fiber can be identified with GLp (D).
Definition 4.1 Generic elements in X 0 are those surjective φ such that
  1. either (, )1 restricted on ker(φ) is nondegenerate;
  2. or if the above case is not possible,
                                   dimD (ker(φ) ∩ ker(φ)⊥ ) = 1
      0
Let X00  be the subset of generic elements. The subspaces ker(φ) in G(m, m − p) are called
generic (m − p)-subspaces. The set of generic (m − p)-subspaces is denoted by G0 (m, m − p).
Consider the following fibration
                                         0
                              GLp (D) → X00 → G0 (m, m − p).
                                                                       0
Since the set G0 (m, m − p) is open and dense in G(m, m − p), the set X00 is open and dense
                     0
in X00 . Therefore, X00 is open and dense in X 0 .

First, suppose (, )1 restricted to ker(φ) is nondegenerate. We must have
                                   ker(φ) ⊕ ker(φ)⊥ = V1
The isotropic subgroup G1 φ can be identified with G1 (ker(φ)) by restriction according to
Theorem 4.1. It is a smaller group of type G1 . The group G1φ is automatically unimodular.

Secondly, suppose
                                dimD (ker(φ) ∩ ker(φ)⊥ ) = 1
Notice that this case does not occur for O(p, q). From Theorem 4.2, G1 φ is a unimodular
group. We obtain

                                             15
                                           0
Corallary 4.1 For any generic element φ ∈ X00 , the isotropy subgroup G1 φ is always
unimodular.

4.3    Averaging Integral Revisited
Let π be an irreducible unitary representation in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ).
Recall that

is a unitary representation of G1 . Consider the integral
                            Z Z
                                     φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)dx(u, π0 (g)v)dg                      (11)
                              G1   X0

where φ, ψ are K-finite vectors in L2 (X 0 ) and u, v ∈ π0 .
Theorem 4.3 Let π be an irreducible unitary representation in the semistable range of
θ(M G1 , M G2 ). Let φ, ψ be in the Harish-Chandra module of ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ). Let u, v ∈
π0 . Then the function φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)(u, π0 (g)v) is continuous and absolutely integrable on
G1 × X 0 . Therefore we have
       Z Z                                      Z Z
                φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)dx(u, π0 (g)v)dg =        (φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)(u, π0 (g)v)dgdx

From our discussion in Part II, the integral 11 is a form of the averaging integral under the
mixed model
                  ω(M G1 , M G2 ) ∼
                                  = ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ) ⊗ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ).
The absolute integrabilty of φ(g −1 x)ψ(x)(u, π0 (g)v) is guaranteed by the semistable condi-
tion (see [5]). We skip the proof.

4.4    Orbital integral in General
First, let me quote a simplified version of Theorem 8.36 from [10].
Theorem 4.4 Let G be a unimodular group and H be a closed unimodular subgroup of
G. Let dg and dh be their Haar measures, respectively. Then up to a scalar, there exists a
unique G-invariant measure d[gH] on G/H. Furthermore, this measure can be normalized
such that for any L1 function on G,
                           Z            Z   Z
                              f (g)dg =        f (gh)dhd[gH].

Suppose τ is a unitary representation of G, u and v are K finite vectors in τ .
Theorem 4.5 Let G be a real reductive group, and M be a G-homogeneous space.
   • Let x0 be a fixed base point and G0 be the isotropy group of x0 . Suppose that G0 is
     unimodular. Then M is isomorphic to G/G0 and possesses a G-invariant measure.
   • Let γ : M → G be a smooth section of the principle bundle

      except for a subset of at least codimension 1. Assume φ(y) is an absolutely integrable
      function on M . Then                Z

                                              M
      is well-defined.

Proof: (1) follows directly from Theorem 4.4 by identifying M with G/G0 .

Since τ is unitary and φ(y) is integrable, v0 is well-defined. (2) is proved.

We can further utilize the right invariance of the Haar measure on G by changing x0 into
an arbitrary x ∈ M .

4.5      Orbital Integral I(φ, u, Ox )
                                   0
Let Ox be a generic G1 -orbit in X00 . Then Ox possesses an G1 -invariant measure. Let π
be a unitary representation in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ). Let us recall some
notations and facts from Part II.
  1. ξ is a central unitary character of M 0 G1 and any element g 0 in M 0 G1 can be expressed
     as a pair (ξ, g) with g in G1 .
  2. π0 = ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π ⊗ ξ is a representation of G1 .
We fix a K-finite vector u in π ⊗ ξ. Suppose
                                             X
                                             s

First of all, due to Theorem 4.3, the above integral converges absolutely. Since X00 is open
                 0
and dense in X ,
                     Z   Z X
                   2            φ0i (g −1 x)φ0j (x)(φ′j ⊗ u, π0 (g)(φ′i ⊗ u))dgdx

                                                                                 0
converges absolutetly. Due to Fubini’s Theorem, for almost all the orbits Ox in X00 , the
function
                 φ0i (g −1 x)φ0j (x)(φ′j ⊗ u, π0 (g)(φ′i ⊗ u)) ∀ i, j ∈ [1, s]
is absolutely integrable on Ox × G1 . Secondly, since {φ0j }sj=1 are rapidly decaying functions
in the Schrödinger model of ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 )), {φ0j }sj=1 are absolutely integrable on X00
                                                                                             0
                                                                                                .
          0 s
Hence {φj }j=1 are absolutely integrable on almost every G1 orbit Ox .

Take M to be an G1 -orbit Ox such that
    1. φ0j is absolutely integrable on Ox for every j;
    2. The function
                                           φ0i (g −1 x)φ0j (x)(φ′j ⊗ u, π0 (g)(φ′i ⊗ u))

Denote the orbital integral

4.6        Compactly Supported Continuous Functions
The theorems we have so far proved hold for compactly supported continuous (not necessar-
ily smooth) functions φ0i , ψi0 as well. In fact, any compactly supported continuous function
on X 0 can be dominated by a multiple of the Gaussian function µ(x) on X 0 . Therefore,
the function
                            |φ0i (g −1 x)ψj0 (x)(ψj′ ⊗ u, π0 (g)(φ′i ⊗ v))|
is always in L1 (G1 × X 0 ). The rest of the argument from Part III goes through. Again, we
obtain
Theorem 4.7 Let π be a unitary representation in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ).
Let u be a K-finite vector in π ⊗ ξ. Let φ0i be compactly supported continuous functions on
X 0 and φ′i ∈ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 ). Write

                                                                   X

             (φ ⊗ u, φ ⊗ u)π = 2                                  φ0i (g −1 x)φ0j (x)(φ′j ⊗ u, π0 (g)(φ′i ⊗ u))dgdx

I(φ, u, O) converges absolutely. Fix such an orbit Ox and a base point x. Choose any smooth

                                                                       20
5      Part IV: Positivity and Unitarity
Lemma 5.1 Suppose π is a unitary representation in R(M G1 , ω(M G1 , M G2 )). Suppose
for every φ ∈ ω(M G1 , M G2 ) and a fixed nonzero u ∈ π

                                       (φ ⊗ u, φ ⊗ u)π ≥ 0.

Then (, )π is positive semidefinite. If (, )π does not vanish, Then θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is uni-
tary.

A similar statement can be found in [12].

Proof: If (, )π vanishes, the lemma holds automatically. Suppose (, )π does not vanish.
Let Rπ be the radical of (, )π . The linear space

                                    (P ⊗ u)/(Rπ ∩ (P ⊗ u))

must be nontrivial. Otherwise P ⊗ u ⊆ Rπ . Since Rπ is a (g1 , M K1 )-module, by the
(g1 , M K1 )-action,
                                   P ⊗ π c ⊆ Rπ .
This contradicts the nonvanishing of (, )π .

Observe that
                                    (P ⊗ u)/(Rπ ∩ (P ⊗ u))
is an admissible Harish-Chandra module of M G2 . From Theorem 7.8 [5], it must be
irreducible and equivalent to P ⊗ π c /Rπ . Since
                              Z
                                   (φ, ω(g)φ)(π(g)u, u)dg ≥ 0
                                 MG1

for a fixed u ∈ π and any K-finite φ, (, )π |P⊗u induces an invariant positive definite form
on θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π). Thus θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) must be unitary. Consequently, (, )π must
be positive semidefinite. Q.E.D.

5.1     Proof of the Main Theorem
Theorem 5.1 Let Ξ(g) be Harish-Chandra’s basic spherical function of G1 . Suppose
    1. π is a unitary representation in the semistable range of θ(M G1 , M G2 ).
    2. For any x, y ∈ G1 , the function Ξ(xgy) is integrable on G1 φ for every generic φ ∈
       HomD (V1 , X20 ) (see Definition 4.1).
    3. π0 is weakly contained in L2 (G1 ).
Then (, )π is positive semidefinite. If (, )π does not vanish, then θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is unitary.

Roughly speaking, the second condition requires G1 φ be half the ”size” of G1 . The first
condition is redundant assuming the second and the third conditions are true. The third
conditions can be converted into a growth condition on the matrix coefficients of π.




                                               21
Proof of the Theorem: Let u be a fixed K-finite vector in π ⊗ ξ. Write
                                  X
                                  s
                   S = {φ =             φ0i ⊗ φ′i | φ0i ∈ Cc∞ (X 0 ), φ′i ∈ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )}.
                                  i=1

                                                0
Let φ ∈ S. Choose an arbitrary G1 -orbit Ox in X00 such that I(φ, u, Ox ) converges abso-
lutely. There is a canonical fibre bundle

                                                   G1x → G1 → Ox .

Fix a smooth section γ : Ox → G1 over an open dense subset of Ox such that the closure of
γ(supp(φ0i )) is compact for every i. Let
                                Z X
                          u0 =          φ0i (y)π0 (γ(y)−1 )(φ′i ⊗ u)dy.
                                           Ox      i

From Theorem 2.3, we have
                                             Z
                                                        (π0 (g)u0 , u0 )dg ≥ 0.
                                                 G1 x

Combined with Theorem 4.7, we obtain

                                               I(φ, u, Ox ) ≥ 0;
                                                 Z
                               (φ ⊗ u, φ ⊗ u)π =             I(φ, u, O)d[O] ≥ 0.
                                                                  0
                                                           O∈G1 \X00

We have thus proved that the Hermitian form (, )π restricted to S ⊗u is positive semidefinite,
i.e.,                 Z
                                        (ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)φ, φ)(u, π(g̃)u)dg̃ ≥ 0
                                 MG1

for every φ ∈ S.

For an arbitrary K-finite vector f in ω(M G1 , M G2 ), write

                   X
                   s
          f=             fk0 (x) ⊗ fk′        (fk0 ∈ ω(M 0 G1 , M 0 G02 ), fk′ ∈ ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )).
                   k=1

                                            (j)
For each k, choose a sequence ψk (x) ∈ Cc∞ (X 0 ) such that
                                                         (j)
                                                       |ψk (x)| ≤ |f (x)|
                                                         (j)
                                                       ψk (x) → f (x).
              Ps         (j)
Let ψ (j) =    k=1   ψk ⊗ fk′ . Apparently, ψ (j) ∈ S and

        (ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)ψ (j) , ψ (j) )(u, π(g̃)u) → (ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)f, f )(u, π(g̃)u)


                                                               22
pointwise. Furthermore,
                                               X
                                               s
|(ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)ψj , ψj )(u, π(g̃)u)| ≤           |(ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)|fk0 |⊗fk′ , |fi0 |⊗fi′ )(u, π(g̃)u)|.
                                               k,i=1

By the definition of semistable range, the function

                       |((ω(M G1 , M G2 )(g̃)|fk0 | ⊗ fk′ , |fi0 | ⊗ fi′ )(u, π(g̃)u)|

is absolutely integrable on M G1 (see [5]). Hence, by dominated convergence theorem,

                        (f ⊗ u, f ⊗ u)π = lim (ψ (j) ⊗ u, ψ (j) ⊗ u)π ≥ 0
                                               j→∞

Therefore, the form (, )π is positive semidefinite. If (, )π does not vanish, then (, )π considered
as a form on
                                        θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π)
is positive definite ( see [5]). We conclude that θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π) is unitary. Q.E.D.

For (G1 , G2 ) in the stable range, the generic isotropic group G1 φ will be trivial. In this
case, if π is an irreducible unitary representation of M G1 , then (, )π is positive semidefinite
and nonvanishing. This result is due to Li ( [11]).

5.2     G1 = Sp2n (R)
Take G1 = Sp2n (R) as an example. We can make our theorem more precise. First let me
define a partial order  in Rn . We say that a  b if and only if

                                             X
                                             k              X
                                                            k
                                                   aj ≤           bj
                                             j=1            j=1

for all k.

Corallary 5.1 Suppose n < p ≤ q. Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of
M Sp2n (R). Suppose for every leading exponent (see Chapter 8.8 in [9]) v of π we have
                                        p+q
                             ℜ(v) − (       − n − 1)  −ρ(Sp2n (R)).
                                         2
Then (, )π is positive semidefinite. In addition, if (, )π is nonvanishing, then

                                           θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π)

is unitary.

Proof: Take V1 = R2n and X20 = Rn+1 . Then V2′ is a linear space equipped with a
nondegenerate symmetric form of signature (p − n − 1, q − n − 1). We verify the conditions
in Theorem 5.1.
   • For x ∈ Hom (V1 , X20 ), the generic isotropic group G1x is just Spn−1 (R) for n odd.
     For n even, the generic G1 x can be identified with Spn−2 (R) × N where N ∼
                                                                               = Rn . One
     can easily check that Ξ(g) for Sp2n (R) is integrable on G1 x .

                                                       23
   • Since
                                        p+q
                             ℜ(v) − (       − n − 1)  −ρ(Sp2n (R)),
                                         2
      π0 = ω(M ′ G1 , M ′ G′2 )c ⊗ π ⊗ ξ has almost square integrable matrix coefficients. Ac-
      cording to Theorem 1 of [1], π0 is weakly contained in L2 (G1 ).
   • The first condition is really redundant. By Theorem 3.2 [11], matrix coefficients
     of ω(M O(n + 1, n + 1), M Sp2n (R)) are in L2−δ (M Sp2n (R)) for small δ > 0. Since
     π0 is almost square integrable, the matrix coefficients of ω(M O(p, q), M Sp2n (R)) ⊗ π
     are in L1−δ0 (M G2 ) for small δ0 > 0. Thus π must be in the semistable range of
     θ(M G1 , M G2 ).
We conclude that (, )π is positive semidefinite. Q.E.D.

5.3    G1 = O(p, q)
Similarly, we obtain
Corallary 5.2 Suppose p + q ≤ 2n + 1. Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of
M O(p, q). Suppose for every leading exponent v of π we have
                                           p+q
                             ℜ(v) − (n −       )  −ρ(O(p, q)).
                                            2
Then (, )π is positive semidefinite. In addition, if (, )π is nonvanishing, then

                                      θ(M G1 , M G2 )(π)

is unitary.
For p + q odd, the growth condition concerning the leading exponent v can be strengthened
to allow
                                       p+q−1
                          ℜ(v) − (n −           )  −ρ(O(p, q)).
                                          2
The proof is omitted.
