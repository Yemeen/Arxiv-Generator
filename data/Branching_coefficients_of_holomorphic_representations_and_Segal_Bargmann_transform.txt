                                                     A BSTRACT. Let D = G/K be a complex bounded symmetric domain of tube type in a
                                                     Jordan algebra VC , and let D = H/L = D ∩ V be its real form in a Jordan algebra V ⊂ VC .
                                                     The analytic continuation of the holomorphic discrete series on D forms a family of inter-
                                                     esting representations of G. We consider the restriction on D of the scalar holomorphic
                                                     representations of G, as a representation of H. The unitary part of the restriction map
                                                     gives then a generalization of the Segal-Bargmann transform. The group L is a spherical
                                                     subgroup of K and we find a canonical basis of L-invariant polynomials in components of
                                                     the Schmid decomposition and we express them in terms of the Jack symmetric polyno-
                                                     mials. We prove that the Segal-Bargmann transform of those L-invariant polynomials are,
                                                     under the spherical transform on D, multi-variable Wilson type polynomials and we give a
                                                     simple alternative proof of their orthogonality relation. We find the expansion of the spher-

                                                     holomorphic polynomials on D, the coefficients being the Wilson polynomials.

                                                Let D = G/K be a complex bounded symmetric domain of tube type. The weighted
                                             Bergman spaces Hν on D form unitary representations of G and are also called the scalar
                                             holomorphic discrete series. They have analytic continuation in terms of the weight ν and
                                             constitute some interesting and important family of unitary representations of G. It has
                                             turned out that it is very fruitful to study the restriction of the holomorphic representation
                                             to certain subgroups, both from the point of representation theory and harmonic analysis.
                                             In this paper we will pursue this by studying the restriction on some real forms of D.
                                                The domain D can be realized as a unit ball in a Jordan triple VC . Let V be a real form of
                                             VC , VC = V + iV . The real form D = V ∩ D is called a real bounded symmetric domain
                                             if the complex conjugation τ with respect to V keeps D invariant. In this case D = H/L
                                             is also a Riemannian symmetric space where H is a symmetric subgroup of G and L is a
                                             symmetric subgroup of K. Thus we have the following commutative diagram of subgroup

   We consider the branching law of the holomorphic representation Hν on D along the
diagram. The branching of Hν under K is given by the Schmid decomposition, whereas its
restriction to H (the left vertical line) is given by the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform
(see [26] and [39]), which gives the unitary equivalence between Hν as the L2 -space on the
D. To continue this study, we consider the L-invariant elements in Hν . The branching
along the lower horizontal line is then given by the Helgason spherical transform; so to get
diagram around we need to find all the L-invariant elements in the Schmid decomposition
and calculate their Segal-Bargmann and spherical transform, this will be the main task of
the present paper.
   Let r be the rank of D, so that the rank of D is also r if the root system of H/L is
of type Ar−1 or Dr , it is 2r other wise; see Appendix 2. Let W be the Weyl group of
the root system of the symmetric space H/L. The space P = P(VC ) of holomorphic
polynomials on VC under the natural action of the compact group K is decomposed into
irreducible subspaces Pn with signature n = n1 γ1 + · · · + nr γr for types A, D or B,
and n = n1 γ1 + n′1 γ1′ + · · · + nr γr + n′r γr′ for other types, with multiplicity one. This
decomposition can also be viewed as the diagonalization of a system of Cayley-Capelli
type operators, namely ∆(z)−α ∆(∂)∆(z)α+1 , where ∆ is the determinant polynomial of
the Jordan triple VC and α are nonnegative integers; moreover the eigenvalues of those
operators separate the spaces Pn . We consider its subspace PnL of L-invariant elements.
By using the Cartan-Helgason theorem we find those signatures n, to be called spherical
signature, for which PnL 6= 0. Our first goal will be to find those polynomials.
   For type A those polynomials are the well-known Jack symmetric polynomials and their
norm has been calculated by Faraut-Koranyi [7]; there are also studied intensively by com-
binatorial method [23]. We shall study in [3] their Segal-Bargmann transform both in
bounded and unbounded realization in relation to the Laplace-transform. However for other
types those polynomials have not been determined in representation theory. We will use
the Chevalley restriction theorem and the Dunkl-Cherednik operators to find them.
   Let h = q + l be the Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra h of H and let a be a
maximal abelian subspace of q. Denote Σ the root system of (h, a) and W the correspond-
ing Weyl group. The space q can be identified with the Jordan triple V . By a well-known
theorem of Chevalley the restriction map from P L of L-invariant polynomials on VC to a is
an isomorphism onto the subspace P(a)W of W -invariants polynomials in P(a). Thus for
each L-spherical signature n there exists up to constants a unique polynomials in Pn . Let
Dξ , ξ ∈ a, be the Dunkl operators. We can construct a family Ui of commuting operators
acting on polynomials on a. For root system of type A, C those operators have been previ-
ously constructed by Dunkl [6]. We prove that when acting on L-invariant polynomials p

and restricted to a,
                                                      r
                                                      Y
                       ∆(z)−α ∆(∂)∆(z)α+1 p(z) =        (Ui + α)p(z).
                                                       i=1

Thus the problem of diagonalizing the Cayley-Capelli operator is reduced to that for the
operators Ui . We find those polynomials pn ∈ PnL in terms of the Jack polynomials and we
calculated the Fock space norm of those polynomials; for type C those are done in [6] by
some different method. We can then find the norm of those polynomials in the Bergman
space Hν , by using the result of Faraut-Koranyi.
   We calculate then the Fourier and spherical transforms of the Segal-Bargmann trans-
forms of those polynomials in the setting of Fock spaces and respectively Bergman spaces.
They are, up to a factor of the square root of the symbol of the Berezin transform, Weyl
group invariant orthogonal polynomials and will be called the branching or coupling co-
efficients as appeared in the title. In the former case we prove that they are of the form
    1    2
e− 4ν kλk ζn,ν (λ), where ζn,ν (λ) are Hermite type polynomials. Let Jν (x, λ) be the Bessel
                                                                                    ν    2
function associated with the action of L on V , we prove that in the expansion of e 2 kxk Jν (x, λ)
in terms of pn (x) the coefficients are exactly ζn,ν (λ). In the later case (curved case) the
                                                                                         1
spherical transform of the Segal-Bargmann transform of pn is of the form bν (λ) 2 ξn (λ),
where bν (λ) is the symbol of the Berezin transform; the symbol has been found indepen-
dently in [34], [24] and [39]. (See also [32] for the case of complex bounded symmetric
domains.) Thus the polynomials ξm (λ) are W -invariant orthogonal polynomial with re-
spect to the measure bν (λ)|c(λ)|−2 where c(λ) is the Harish-Chandra c-function. They are
some limiting cases of the multi-variable Wilson polynomials [33], so that the measure
in the orthogonality relation has now an analytic significance. We find also an expan-
sion of the product of the spherical function on D with the reproducing kernel in terms of
the L-invariant polynomials, the coefficient being the spherical transform of their Segal-
Bargmann transform (see Theorem 9.1). We give thus a unification of the two types of
orthogonal polynomials associated to a root system, homogeneous symmetric polynomials
of Jack type on one hand and the non-homogeneous Wilson polynomials on the other. For
a general root system the Wilson polynomials have been studied by van-Diejen [33] under
certain self-dual condition.
   Along our way of the study we find an isometric version of the Chevalley restriction
theorem (see Proposition 5.2) and an analogy of the Capelli identity expressing the product
Q           Q                                            Q
    xj and Dj in terms of the Cherednik operators Uj , which we believe are also of
independent interest; see [31] and [15] for the related study.
   We remark that Theorem 6.9 can be deduced from [6], provided that one proves that
they are eigenpolynomials of the (product of) the Cherednik operators and identify ours
with that of Dunkl; in that paper Dunkl studied the a more general class of polynomials
invariant under certain subgroups of the Weyl group and found the norm.

   We refer also the reader to [14] for some algebraic consideration about finding polyno-
mial invariants of linear groups and [17], [18] for some general results concerning the
branching of unitary highest weight representations. We mention also that our results
can also be interpreted as finding eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians for the Calogero-
Sutherland model for many body system, both with rational (flat case) and hyperbolic
trigonometric (bounded case) first order differential operators in the Hamiltonian; see e.g.
[6] for the flat case.
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give an abbreviated introduction of
weighted Bergman spaces on bounded symmetric domains and fix some notation. In Sec-
tion 3 we present the Segal-Bargmann transform and Berezin transform on real bounded
symmetric domains, thus establish the abstract orthogonality relation for the spherical
transforms of the Segal-Bargmann transforms of the L-invariant polynomials. We identify
those Schmid components Pn which contain non-trivial L-invariant polynomials in Section
4. In Section 5 we express the radial part of the Cayley-Capelli type operator in terms of the
Dunkl operator. Their eigenspace decomposition is done in Sections 6 and 7. In Sections
8 and 9 we study their Segal-Bargmann transforms and prove their orthogonality relation
and find the expansion of the Bessel and spherical functions. We evaluate the constant in
the Plancherel formula for the symmetric space H/L in our settings in Appendix 1, and we
list all the real forms H/L of a general Hermitian symmetric space in Appendix 2.

   We recall very briefly in this and next sections some preliminary results on bounded
symmetric domains and fix notation; see [21] and [7] and reference therein.
   Let D = G/K be an irreducible bounded symmetric domain of tube type in a d-
dimensional complex vector space VC = Cd of rank r ′. (The symbol r will be reserved
for the rank of the real bounded symmetric domain D in Section 3.) Let g = k + p be the
Cartan decomposition and gC = p+ + kC + p− be the Harish-Chandra decomposition of its
complexification. The space VC = p+ has then a Jordan triple structure so that the subspace
p is of the form
(2.1)                              p = {v − Q(z)v̄, v ∈ VC },
when the elements are realized as holomorphic vector fields, where Q(z) : V¯C 7→ VC is qua-
dratic in z. We denote {xȳz} the Jordan triple product {xȳz} = (Q(x+z)−Q(x)−Q(z))ȳ.
We fix a K-invariant Hermitian inner product (·, ·) on VC so that a minimal tripotent has
norm 1. We let dm(z) be the corresponding Lebesgue measure. The Bergman reproducing
kernel up to a positive constant is of the form h(z, w̄)−p where p is the genus of D, defined
by p = 2d r′
             (for tube domains) and h(z, w̄) is an irreducible polynomial holomorphic in z
and anti-holomorphic in w.
    Let ν > p − 1 and consider the probability measure dµν (z) = c′ν h(z, z̄)ν−p dm(z) where
c′ν is the normalization constant, and the corresponding weighted Bergman space Hν =
Hν (D) of holomorphic functions f so that
                                        Z
                                   2

                                    −ν
It has reproducing kernel h(z, w̄) . The group G acts unitarily on Hν via the following
                                                      ν
(2.2)                             πν f (z) = Jg−1 (z) p f (g −1z),
and it forms a unitary projective representation of G.

  Let Fν = Fν (VC ), for ν > 0, be the Fock space of entire function on VC with the norm
defined by
                                      Z
                                   νd
                        (p, q)Fν = d      p(z)q(z)e−ν(z,z) dm(z).
                                   π VC
Thus it has reproducing kernel eν(z,w) . When ν = 1 we write for simplicity F = F1 . The
norm in F can alternatively defined by

for polynomials f and g, where g ∗ is obtained from g by taking formerly the complex
conjugate of the coefficients of the monomials (in terms of an orthonormal basis in VC ).
   The first part of the next result is due to Hua [16] for classical domains and Schmid [30]
for general domains, the second and third part is due to Faraut and Koranyi [7], Theorem
3.8; this result will be of fundamental importance for our work here. Fix a Cartan subalge-
bra of k and let γ1 > · · · > γr′ be the Harish-Chandra strongly orthogonal roots. Let a′ be
                          γ −γ
the root multiplicity of j 2 k in p+ .

                                                 n≥0

Each Pn is of lowest weight −n = −(n1 γ1 + · · · + nr γr ) with n1 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 0. The
quotient of the norms of a polynomial f ∈ Pn in the Fock space F and in the weighted

        3. B EREZIN   AND   BARGMANN      TRANSFORM ON REAL BOUNDED SYMMETRIC
                                               DOMAINS

   Let V be a real form of VC and τ the complex conjugation with respect to V . Suppose
τ (D) = D, namely, τ fixes the bounded symmetric domain. Then the real form D = D ∩ V
is called a real bounded symmetric domain. In this case the triple product D(x, ȳ)z =
{xȳz} restricted on V defines also a triple product on V .
   A complete list of real bounded symmetric domains D is given in [21]. As a Riemannian
symmetric space, D = H/L, where H is the connected component of the subgroup of G
of biholomorphic transformations of D which keep D invariant. The coset space G/H is
called a causal symmetric space, a complete list of the pairs (G, H) can be found in e.g.
[25] and [13], see also Appendix 2.
   The H-invariant measure on D is
                                                   p
(3.1)                                    h(z, z̄)− 2 dm(z),
                                    p
and H acts unitarily on L2 (D, h− 2 dm) via change of variables,
(3.2)                          π0 (g)f (x) = f (g −1x),         g ∈ H.
  We describe briefly some algebraic and geometric structures of the domain D.
  Let h = q ⊕ l be the Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra h of H. Similar to (2.1) we
have
(3.3)                             q = {v − Q(z)v̄, v ∈ V }.
We thus identify q with the underlying space V via the mapping v 7→ ξv (z).
   Let r the rank of D = H/L, so that the rank r ′ of D will be r or 2r; see below. Let
{ej , j = 1, . . . , r} be a frame of minimal tripotents in V . The elements ξj = ξej =
ej − Q(z)e¯j , j = 1, . . . , r, span a maximal subspace a of q of dimension r. Let {βj , j =
1, . . . , r} in a∗ be the dual basis of 21 ξj ,
                                           βj (ξk ) = 2δj,k ,
where δj,k is the Kronecker symbol. Then the root system Σ(g, a) is of types Ar , Cr or Dr .
Type Ar corresponds to the case that V is a formal real Jordan algebra; we will be only
concerned with type Cr and type Dr (r ≥ 3):
                                                        βj ± βk
                                 Σ(g, a) = {±βj ,               };
                                                           2
and respectively
                                               βj ± βk
                                    Σ(g, a) = {        }.
                                                  2
                                                  β ±β
We let, as in [39], a be the root multiplicity of j 2 k and ι − 1 that of βj . Arrange an
ordering of the roots so that
                                        β1 < β2 < · · · < βr .

The ranks r ′ and r and the multiplicities a′ , a and ι − 1 are related to each other:
(3.4)                                     r ′ = r, a′ = 2a
if it is type Dr (r ≥ 3), and
(3.5)                              r ′ = 2r, a = 2a′ , ι = 2 + a′ ;
if it is type Cr for r ≥ 2; a′ = 0 and ι = 2 + a′ if r = 1. Those relation can easily be
obtained by calculations of the dimensions of the root spaces or by a case by case check of
the table in the Appendix 2.
   We note that with the above normalization of the inner product on VC a minimal tripotent
                 √
of V has norm 2 if the root system is of Type C, otherwise it is of norm 1; see below.
(The inner product in [39] is normalized so that a minimal tripotent of V always has norm
1.)
   To consider the branching law of (Hν , πν ) of G under H we let R be the restriction map
([26]) R : Hν → C ∞ (D) by
                                                        ν
(3.6)                           Rf (x) = f (x)h(x, x̄) 2 ,    x ∈ D.
Then R is an H-intertwining map, as one can easily checks from the transformation prop-
erties of h(x, x̄). Consider its formal conjugate operator R∗ from L2 (D, dµ0) to H ν and
form the operator R∗ R on L2 (D, ω). It is
                                                  1

(3.8)                Bν f (z) = cν      f (w)                               p .
                                      D           h(z, w̄)ν        h(w, w̄) 2
is the (normalized) Berezin transform and the constant cν is such that Bν 1 = 1. The
constant cν is evaluated in [39]. Let
(3.9)                                        R = |R|U
be the polar decomposition of R. Thus |R|2 = RR∗ .
   It is proved in [39] that when ν > p − 1 for type C and suppose ν > p2 − 1 the Berezin
                                                          ν                p
transform RR∗ is bounded, and that the multiplier h 2 is in L1 (D, h− 2 dm(z)). Since for
those values of ν the space Hν contains all polynomials, thus the range of R contains
                                   ν
the functions of the form h(z, z̄) 2 p(z, z̄) where p(z, z̄) are polynomials of z and it clearly
                                       p
forms a dense subspace in L2 (D, h− 2 dm(z)). This proves

Proposition 3.1. Suppose ν > p − 1 for type C and suppose ν > 2p − 1 for type D. The
operator U is unitary and intertwines H-actions (2.2) on Hν and (3.2) onto L2 (D).

Definition 3.2. The unitary operator U is called a (generalized) Segal-Bargmann trans-
form.

  Let φλ be the spherical function on D = H/L. Let

support. It is well known ([11], Chapter IV) that the map extends to a unitary operator from
L2 (D)L onto L2 (a∗ , Co |c(λ)|−2 dλ)W of W -invariant functions in the L2 space on a∗ . Here
c(λ) is the Harish-Chandra c-function, with the same normalization as in [11], Chapter IV,
dλ is the regularly normalized measure and the constant C0 can be evaluated by using the
evaluation of the constant cν in [39] and the evaluation of the Selberg integral, see Appendix
1.
                            c is a unitary operator from HL onto L2 (a∗ , Co |c(λ)|−2 dλ)W .
Corollary 3.3. The map f 7→ Uf                            ν

  In particular if we find a canonical orthogonal basis HνL , their image under the above
unitary operator then gives an orthogonal basis L2 (a∗ , Co |c(λ)|−2 dλ)W .

Proof. The involution τ on VC induced an involution on k and its fixed point set is l, thus
(k, l) is a symmetric pair. Let k = l + k−
                                         τ be the corresponding Cartan decomposition. Let

 τ ⊂ kτ be a maximal abelian subspace of kτ , and t = kτ + kτ a Cartan subalgebra of

identify the L-spherical representations, which asserts in our case that the representation

one-dimensional. Here N is the set of nonnegative integers.
   Consider the type Dr first. By (3.1) the frame {e1 , e2 , . . . , er } of minimal tripotents in
V is also a frame in VC . Recall the involution τ induced by the complex conjugation on VC
with respect to V . We have τ (ξej ) = ξej τ (ξiej ) = −ξej . Thus
                                   τ (iD(ej , ej )) = −iD(ej , ej ),
since
                                                       1
                                      iD(ej , ej ) = [ξej , ξiej ],
                                                       2
so that iD(ej , ej ) ∈ t− τ , j =  1, . . . , r, and they  span an r-dimensional abelian subspace
i(RD(e1 , e1 )+· · ·+RD(e1 , e1 )) of tτ , whereas the dimension of t−
                                           −                                          −
                                                                           τ is dim(tτ ) = rank(K/L).
We claim that rank(K/L) > r. Indeed the symmetric pair (k, l) is (s(u(r) ⊕ u(r)), so(r) ⊕
so(r)), (u(2r), so(2r)) or (so(10) + R, sp(4)) (with r = 3), the rank of the first pair being
2r − 1 > r, the second 2r > r and the third 7 > 3 (see [11], Table V, p. 518). This means
that the subspace i(RD(e1 , e1 ) + · · · + RD(e1 , e1 )) is a nontrivial subspace of k−       τ . So the
vanishing condition (4.3) is already satisfied since n is vanishing on the orthogonal com-
plement of i(RD(e1 , e1 )+· · ·+RD(e1 , e1 )) in t. To check the second condition, recall (see
                                                                                       γj −γk

α orthogonal to 2 and if nonzero, kαk = k 2 k . Notice that since 2 , viewed as
linear functional on t−  τ , only span a r − 1-dimensional subspace, thus there exist roots in
    C    − C                  γ −γ
Σ(k , (tτ ) ) of the form j 2 k + α with nonzero α for all j, k = 1, . . . , r, j 6= k. Thus by
the Cartan-Helgason theorem, the polynomial representation n is L-spherical if and only if

when α = 0. The first condition clearly implies the second and it is just our stated condition.
  Now consider type Cr . There are only three cases and we study them case by case.
Consider the case (k, l) = (s(u(2r) ⊕ u(2r)), sp(r) ⊕ sp(r)). The highest weight n =
(m1 ε1 +m2 ε2 +· · ·+m2r ε2r )⊗(m1 ε1 +m2 ε2 +· · ·+m2r ε2r )∗ where εj is the dual of diagonal
matrix with jth entry being 1 and rest 0, in the standard matrix representation of u(2r), and
(m1 ε1 + m2 ε2 + · · · + m2r ε2r )∗ is the contra-gradient representation. The representation m
has a l = sp(r) ⊕ sp(r)-fixed vector if and only if the representation m1 ε1 + m2 ε2 + · · · +
m2r ε2r has a sp(r)-fixed vector, and the later happens precisely when m1 = m2 , m3 =
m4 , . . . , m2r−1 = m2r , namely our condition, again by the Cartan-Helgason theorem, since
(su(2r), sp(r)) is a symmetric pair. Now let (k, l) = (u(2r), sp(r)). The Harish-Chandra
roots are γj = 2ε2j−1, γj′ = 2ε2j . Our result immediately follows from the above argument.
Finally consider (k, l) = (so(2) ⊕ so(p), so(p)). The highest weight n = m2 (γ1 + γ2 ) +

(m1 − m2 )(γ1 ), and as representations n = m2 (γ1 + γ2 ) ⊗ (m1 − m2 )γ1 with m2 (γ1 + γ2 )
being the trivial representation of so(p) and (m1 − m2 )γ1 the representation of so(p) on the
spherical harmonics of degree m1 − m2 , the later has an so(p)-invariant vector if and only
if m1 − m2 is even. This completes the proof.

Remark 4.2. In [19] Krämer has given a classification of all spherical connected sub-
groups L of a simple compact Lie group K (Tabelle 1, loc. cit) and listed all the fun-
damental spherical highest weights. Our result can also be deduced from that list. One
may also prove the above result somewhat by slightly general argument by following the
classification as in [25] and [21]. Moreover the above result for type C holds also for type
BC and that for type D holds also for type B (with m = 0).

  Let ∆(z) be the determinant polynomial of the Jordan triple VC and ∆(∂) the corre-
sponding differential operator which we call the Cayley type operator. The next result
gives the eigevalue of the operator ∆(z)−α ∆(∂)∆(z)α+1 , sometimes also named as the
Cayley-Capelli operator, under the Schmid decomposition (2.4), and its follows easily by
using Theorem 2.1; see e.g. [36], [35].

Lemma 4.3. Let r ′ be the rank of D. The differential operators ∆(z)−α ∆(∂)∆(z)α+1 for
r ′ different nonnegative integers α form a system of generators of K-invariant differential
operators on P(VC ). A holomorphic polynomial f ∈ P(VC ) is in the space Pn if and only
if it is a solution of the system of differential equations
                                   r         ′
                                  Y    a′
                 −α
(4.5)                     α+1
             ∆(z) ∆(∂)∆(z) p(z) =     ( (r ′ − j) + 1 + α + nj )p(z),
                                  j=1
                                       2
for r ′ different nonnegative integers α.

  In the next sections we will find the L-invariant polynomials in Pn .

                                       GENERAL RESULTS

   We consider the Chevalley restriction map Res from P(VC )L onto the space P(a)W of
W -invariant polynomials on a. By using the Dunkl operator we define an inner product
on P(a)W and we prove that the restriction map Res is an unitary map from P(VC )L with
the Fock space norm onto P(a)W . This reduces the problem of finding and calculating of
L-invariant polynomials to the corresponding one of W -invariant polynomials on a.
   Some consideration that follows will be true for some general root system, we shall,
however, only consider the root systems Σ as in Section 3.
   We fix a frame {ej , j = 1, . . . , r} of minimal tripotent in V , enumerated so that ej ∈
V ⊂ V C = p+ is a root vector of the Harish-Chandra orthogonal root γj , j = 1, . . . r, if Σ
is of type C, and ej is a sum of two root vectors with roots γ2j−1 and γ2j for type D.

  For any root α ∈ Σ let rα ∈ W be the reflection defined by α. We recall the Dunkl
operator [4],
                                  1 X        α(ξj )
                        Dj = ∂j +        mα         (1 − rα )
                                  2    +
                                             α(x)
                                           α∈Σ
acting on polynomials f (x) on a, where the rα acts f (x) via
                                     (rα f )(x) = f (rα−1 x).
The operators Dj , j = 1, . . . , r are pairwise commuting, and thus define an isomorphism
between the ring of polynomials on a and the ring of difference-differential operators gen-
erated by them. We can thus define, for any polynomial x = x1 e1 + · · · + xr er → f (x) =
f (x1 , . . . , xr ) the operator f (D) by assigning Dj to the polynomials xj , j = 1, . . . , r.

Definition 5.1. (Dunkl [5]) Let Σ be the root system of type C or type D. The Σ-inner
product on (P(a))W is defined by
                                                     
                              (f, g)Σ = f (Dx )g ∗(x)x=0 ,
if Σ is of type D, and
                                              1          
                                 (f, g)Σ = f ( Dx )g ∗(x)x=0
                                              2
if Σ is of type C.

  The discrepancy for type C here is due to the unmatched norms of minimal tripotents in
VC and V .

Proposition 5.2. The restriction map Res is an isometric mapping from (P(VC )L , k · kF )
onto (P(a)W , k · kΣ ).

Proof. We consider the operators
                                      1
(5.1)                              E = (z12 + · · · + zd2 ),
                                      2
                                       1
(5.2)                             F = − (∂12 + · · · + ∂d2 ),
                                       2
and
                                                            d
(5.3)                           H = (z1 ∂1 + · · · + zd ∂d ) +
                                                            2
acting on the space P(VC ) . Then it is clear that they form the Lie algebra sl(2, C):
                          L


                         [E, F ] = H,   [H, E] = 2E,       [H, F ] = 2F.
Let us, following Heckman [10], define similarly
                                      1
(5.4)                          E0 = (x21 + · · · + x2r ),

for type D, and
(5.6)                               E0 = x21 + · · · + x2r ,
                                        1

                                        4
for type C (again due to the ill-matching of the norms of minimal tripotents in VC and V ),
and
                                                     1        X
(5.8)                 H0 = (x1 ∂1 + · · · + xr ∂d ) + (r +        mα ),

for all types. They form a copy of the Lie algebra sl(2, C). We claim that
                        Res E = E0 ,    Res F = F0 ,      Res H = H0 .
The second is trivial, the third follows since that the dimension d = dimC VC = dimR q =

  + 12 α∈R mα . The first is just the formula for the radial part of the Laplace operator on
q; see [12], Proposition 3.13 for the formula and [4] (or [10]) for the calculation of F0 . It
is proved in [10] Proposition 3.4 that for any polynomial p of degree m on a, viewed as
multiplication operator on P(a), namely in Aut(P(a)),
                                                1
(5.9)                          p(D) = (−1)m        ad(F0 )m (p),
                                               m!
where the Lie algebra sl(2, C) is acting on Aut(P(a)) via the adjoint action. The essentially
same (even easier) calculation shows that, for polynomial P on P(VC ) we have
                                                1
(5.10)                          P (∂) = (−1)m      ad(F )m (P )
                                                m!
                        L
For any P, Q ∈ P(VC ) , let p = Res P , q = Res Q; if x ∈ a,
                 P (∂)Q∗ (x) = (Res P (∂)Q∗ )(x)
                                                                  
                                              m 1         m      ∗
                               = Res((−1)          ad(F ) (P )Q ) (x)
                                               m!
                                                                       

                               = p(∂)q ∗ (x)
and
            (P, Q)F = P (∂)Q∗ (0) = p(∂)q ∗ (0) = (p, q)Σ = (Res P, Res Q)Σ ,
completing the proof.
  It is noted in [10] that the above idea of reducing computation to second order operators
goes back to Harish-Chandra.

Remark 5.3. The above result clarifies the significance of the Dunkl operator and the inner
product (·, ·)Σ . Moreover it gives an isometric version of the Chevalley restriction theorem
([12], Chapter 2, Corollary 5.12). It seems to the author that this was not been known
before.

     As a consequence we get

Corollary 5.4. The Cayley operator Res ∆(∂) on L-invariant polynomials is given by
                                              Yr
                           (Res ∆(∂))f (x) =     Dj f (x)
                                                       j=1

for type D and
                                                            r
                                                            Y
                                   (Res ∆(∂))f (x) = 2−2r         Dj2 f (x)

for type C.

Proof. We consider only the type Dr , the type Cr -case can be proved similarly. Recall that
the determinant function ∆ on VC is of degree r and when restricted on a it is
                                                      Yr         Yr
                                                                     βj
               Res ∆(x) = ∆(x1 e1 + · · · + xr er ) =     xj = (        )(x).
                                                      j=1        j=1

We calculate now the adjoint operator of ∆ and Res ∆. The adjoint operator of multiplica-
tion by ∆(z) on P(VC ) with respect to the Fock norm is ∆(∂), ∆∗ = ∆(∂) and respectively
                       Q     β    Q      β      Q
the multiplication by rj=1 2j is ( rj=1 2j )∗ = rj=1 Dj with respect to the Σ-norm by the
definition of the inner product. Thus for P, Q ∈ P(VC )L we have, by the preceding propo-
sition,
                    (Res(∆(∂)P ), Res Q)R = (∆(∂)P, Q)F = (P, ∆Q)F

   In this section we find the L-invariant polynomials in PnL and calculate their norm in the
Fock space. We will express them in terms of the Jack symmetric polynomials. For that
purpose we recall some basic facts.
   Let

where the superscript indicates that the underlying root system is of type A. Let

be the Cherednik operator for type A ([6] and [2]). Then UjA , j = 1, . . . , r are commuting
                                                                        Q            Q
operators. The relation between UjA and the Cayley type operator rj=1 Dj rj=1 yj is
the following. (It can be viewed as a symmetric invariant analogue of the Cayley-Capelli
identity, which express the product ∆(∂)∆(z) as another determinant.)

Lemma 6.1. The following identity hold

Proof. The proof relies on the commutation relations Di sij = sij Dj and [Di , xj ] = − a2 sij .
From this we deduce that

repeating the argument (moving Dr until it reaches yr ) we get

Remark 6.2. The Cherednik operators UjA are introduced before (see [6] for root systems
of type B and reference therein) in order to study the non-symmetric Jack polynomials.
The above lemma shows that it can also be obtained, though less systematically, in trying
                                   Q          Q
to write the Cayley-type operator ( rj=1 Dj )( rj=1 xj ) as a product of r operators.

   The Jack symmetric polynomial are then a sum of joint (nonsymmetric) eigenfunctions
of Uj . Let Ωm be the normalized Jack symmetric polynomial, so that it is a symmetric

orem. Lemma 4.3 implies that pn is in the space Pn , with n as given, if and only if it is an

Proof. For a fixed j write m′ = mj = (m1 , . . . , mj−1 , mj − 1, mj+1 , . . . , mr ) and let n′

5.2. Now, on the space of all W -invariant polynomials, the adjoint (E0 )∗ = −F0 with
respect to the Σ-inner product, from this we obtain

  Consider the Cherednik operator UjD acting on even functions f (x21 , . . . , x2r ). Performing
the change of variables yj = x2j , we have
                                                   1

                                                   2
where Uj is the operator (6.2). This proves consequently that the Cherednik operators UjD
         A

are also commuting operators when acting on even functions.
   The next result follows then immediately from Corollary 5.4, the formulas (7.3) and
(7.4).

Lemma 8.2. The L-invariant function e 2 kxk Jλ (x) on V has the following expansion in
terms of pn (x)

where the summation is over all n as determined in (4.1) and (4.2).

   The next result computes the Fourier transform of the Segal-Bargmann transform Upn,ν
of pn (λ). Denote f (x) 7→ fe(λ) the Fourier transform on V evaluated on a∗ ,

Proposition 8.3. The Fourier transform Up     gn (λ) of Upn is

(8.5)                      gn (λ) = (−ν)−|n| ( 2π ) d4 ζn,ν (λ)e− 4ν1 kλk2

                                                  ν
Proof. The Berezin transform is the convolution operator with Gaussian kernel, whose
Fourier transform is also a Gaussian. Namely |R|2 has eiλ(x) and therefore the Bessel
function as its eigenfunction. More precisely, we have
                                               2π d 1 2
(8.6)                          |R|2 Jλ (x) = ( ) 2 e− 2ν kλk Jλ (x).
                                                ν
We may rewrite it as
                  Z
                                ν    2            2π d           ν     2   1    2

                   V                               ν
We differentiate both side by the differential operator pn (∂x ) and evaluate at x = 0. To do
this, we observe that
                            pn (∂x )e−ν(x,y) (0) = (−ν)|n| pn (y),
so that the resulting formula is
                        Z

                         V                             ν
The left hand side is actually
(8.8)                        (−ν)|n| Rp                ^n (λ).
                                     gn (λ) = (−ν)|n| |R|Up

On the other hand formula the formula (8.6) implies that
                                ]  2 f (λ) = (
                                               2π d − 1 kλk2 e
                               |R|                ) 2 e 2ν     f (λ)
                                                ν
for any f ∈ L2 (V ). Thus
                                g (λ) = ( 2π ) d4 e− 4ν1 kλk2 fe(λ).
                               |R|f
                                               ν
Substituting this into (8.8) for f = Upn we get
                               gn (λ) = (−ν)|n| ( 2π ) 4d e− 4ν1 kλk2 Up
                      (−ν)|n| Rp                                      gn (λ).

                                   ν
completing the proof.

   The result is this section is parallel to that of the previous section and is an explicit
realization of the Corollary 3.3. We will be brief; see also [29] and [28].
   Recall the Berezin transform Bν in (3.8). It is proved in [39] that Bν defines a H-
invariant bounded operator on L2 (D) with the invariant measure (3.1). Let bν (λ) be its
spectral symbol, namely
                                                 Bν φλ = bν (λ)φλ
in the sense of spectral decomposition, where φλ on D is the spherical function; the function
bν (λ) is explicitly calculated in [39].

is

Note that we have extended the real analytic function h(x, x̄)− 2 to a holomorphic func-

tion, formally written as h(z, z)− 2 , on D. Notice also that both kpnn kν and kpn kν ξn (λ) are
orthonormal basis in the respective Hilbert spaces. Thus (R−1 φλ )(z) is the Schwarz ker-
nel for the unitary operator from HνL onto L2 (a∗ , C0 bνc(λ)

composition of the spherical and Segal-Bargmann transforms.

Remark 9.2. Associated to each root system there are the multi-variable Askey-Wilson
polynomials determined by the root multiplicities (which are positive real numbers) and
two more extra parameters [33]. Our polynomial ξn,ν (λ) depend on extra parameter and
can be reviewed as some limiting cases of the Askey-Wilson polynomials polynomials. We
have thus found an alternative simple proof of the their orthogonality relation. Moreover
                             ν
the (known) expansion of h− 2 in terms of the Jack symmetric polynomials will also give
some evaluation formula for the polynomials; we will however not pursue it here.

Remark 9.3. Consider the spherical function on the Hermitian symmetric space D or on
its compact dual. There are Jacobi type functions. There have been attempts (see [1]) in
expanding the Jacobi functions in terms of the Jack symmetric polynomials and study the
combinatorial properties of the coefficients. It turned out (see [37], [28] and [38]) however
that the expansion of the spherical transform multiplied with the reproducing kernel has a
much better analytical significance. This is also the case here. Further more by considering

analytic continuation in the parameter ν we may recover the expansion of the spherical
functions itself.

  We consider type Dr (r ≥ 3) first, in this case ∆(x) = δ(x) and the rank r(D) is r.
  It is proved in [12], Chapter IV, Exercise C4, that when the H-invariant measure dι(z)
on D = H/K is (regularly) normalized so that
               Z                Z               Y

with dn H the regular normalization, then the Plancherel formula reads
                           Z                  Z
                      |W |          2

By regular normalizations dn H on a it is meant that the dn H is the Euclidean measure on
                                                                                           1

by the Riesz lemma we get an identification of a with a and thus similarly get a regular
measure dn λ on a∗ . In our case they are

transform z 7→ w = e+z  e−z

kind of Selberg type integral and is also known. Let us carry out this calculation. Write I1

the following, and can also be written as

this fraction appears also in I1 . Finally the constant C0 is determined by the formula
                                                 √ r
                                                   2ar

                                                    2π
and we find that
        √ r          √ r
          2π I1        2π √ d         r!                             Γ( a2 )r

   The constant for type Cr can be evaluated similarly and we leave it to the interested
reader.

   We list here the the associated Lie algebras (g, k) and (h, l) of non-compact irreducible
bounded symmetric domains D = G/K ⊂ VC and respectively their real bounded symmet-
ric subdomain D = H/L ⊂ V , when V is not an Euclidean Jordan algebra; see [21]. They
were also classified by Olafsson ([25], [9]) through Lie theoretic methods. The restricted
root systems Σ of (h, l) are also indicated, the name of the types (Types B, BC, etc) is in
consistence with Loos [21], Proposition 11.18.
