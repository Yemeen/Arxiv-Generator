                                                      affine orthogonal group on its Lie algebra. In both cases there are or-
                                                      bits which have a modulus that is different from the usual invariants
                                                      for orthogonal groups. We find an unexplained bijection between ad-
                                                      joint and coadjoint orbits. As a special case, we classify the adjoint
                                                      and coadjoint orbits of the Poincaré group.


                                            1        Introduction
                                            Let (Ve , γe) be an n-dimensional real vector space with a nondegenerate inner
                                            product γ   e. The set O(Ve , γe) of real linear maps B of Ve into itself, which
                                            preserve γ  e, that is, γ  e(Bv, Bw) = γ e(v, w) for every v, w ∈ Ve , is a Lie group
                                            called the orthogonal group. Its Lie algebra o(Ve , γ         e) consists of real linear
                                            maps ξ of Ve into itself such that γ   e(ξv, w) + e   γ (v, ξw) = 0 for every v, w ∈ Ve .
                                            For ξ, η ∈ Ve the Lie bracket on o(Ve , γ      e) is [ξ, η] = ξ ◦ η − η ◦ ξ, where ◦ is
                                            the composition of linear maps. The affine orthogonal group AffO(Ve , γ                   e) =
                                                 e
                                            O(V , γ        e
                                                    e) ⋉ V is the set of real affine orthogonal maps of (V , γ          e  e) into itself.
                                            More precisely, it is the set O(Ve , γ  e) × Ve with group multiplication (B1 , v1 ) ·
                                            (B2 , v2 ) = (B1 B2 , B1 v2 + v1 ), which is the composition of affine linear maps.
                                            The affine orthogonal group is a Lie group. Its Lie algebra affo(Ve , γ                   e) =
                                            o(Ve , γe) × Ve has Lie bracket [(ξ1 , v1 ), (ξ2 , v2 )] = ([ξ1 , ξ2 ], ξ1 v2 − ξ2 v1 ), where
                                            ξ1 , ξ2 lie in o(Ve , γe). The adjoint action of the affine orthogonal group on its
                                            Lie algebra is defined by

                                                              ϕ : (O(Ve , γ
                                                                          e) ⋉ Ve ) × (o(Ve , γ
                                                                                              e) × Ve ) → o(Ve , γ
                                                                                                                 e) × Ve :
                                                                  ((B, v), (ξ, w)) 7→ (B, v) · (ξ, w) · (B, v)−1 ,

                                            where · is composition of affine linear maps. A straightforward calculation
                                            shows that ϕ((B, v), (ξ, w)) = (BξB −1 , −BξB −1 v + Bw).

                                                    This is a revised version of [4]



                                                                                           1
     One of the goals of this paper is to classify the orbits of the adjoint action
of the affine orthogonal group. In particular, we find a unique representative
(= normal form) for each orbit. The basic technique leans heavily on the idea
of an indecomposable type introduced by Burgoyne and Cushman [3] to find
normal forms for the adjoint action of any real form of a nonexceptional Lie
group.3 In this method the emphasis is not on subgroups and subvarieties,
but rather on vector spaces with quadratic forms. (Indeed we learn little
about an orbit as a variety. There is ample room for further work.)
     Our aims are rather limited, but still we get results that seem to be new,
despite a widespread belief that all is known on this topic. As explained in
section 2 below, our affine orthogonal group may be viewed as a subgroup of
a slightly larger orthogonal group O(V, K). We find that the usual eigenvalue
and Jordan invariants that classify the adjoint orbits of this ambient group
O(V, K) do not suffice to distinguish the orbits of the affine orthogonal
group. That is why we have to invent a modulus, which parametrizes families
of adjoint orbits, each family being contained in a single orbit of O(V, K).
In our classification of adjoint orbits we use the fact that we are working
over the reals.
     Next let us turn to the classification of coadjoint orbits. Recall that
Rawnsley [7] has described how in principle one can classify the coadjoint
orbits by reducing the problem to a similar problem for a subgroup known
as the little subgroup. One should be careful though, because there is no
canonical isomorphism between the little subgroup as an actual subgroup
and your favorite incarnation of the isomorphism type of the little subgroup
as a Lie group. This matters because affine orthogonal groups are less rigid
than ordinary orthogonal groups. In particular, rescaling the vector part of
    3
      We recall the idea of an indecomposable type for the special case of the Lie algebra
gl(V ) of the Lie group Gl(Ve ) of invertible real linear maps of Ve into itself. Let ξe ∈ gl(Ve ).
    e
Consider the pair (ξ, e Ve ). On the collection of all pairs we say that two pairs (ξ, e Ve ) and
(ξ , V ) are equivalent if there is a bijective real linear map P : Ve → Ve such that P ξe = ξe′ P .
 e ′ e′                                                                    ′

Note that P defines an isomorphism of Gl(Ve ) with Gl(Ve ′ ). Clearly being equivalent is an
equivalence relation on the collection of pairs. We call an equivalence class a type. Let
∆ be the type represented by the pair (ξ,      e Ve ). Suppose that Ve = W f1 ⊕ W f2 , where W fi
               e                             e f         f
are proper, ξ-invariant subspaces, then ξ|Wi ∈ gl(Wi ). Let ∆i be the type represented by
(ξ|Wfi , W
         fi ). Then ∆ is the sum of ∆1 and ∆2 , which we write as ∆ = ∆1 + ∆2 . This sum
is well defined. We say the the type ∆ is indecomposable if it can not be written as the
sum of two or more types. An indecomposable type is a Jordan block. The main theorem
for classifying the orbits of the adjoint action of Gl(Ve ) on gl(Ve ) is: for every ξe ∈ gl(Ve ),
the type ∆ represented by (ξ,  e Ve ) may be written as a sum of indecomposable types, which
is unique up to reordering of the summands. This is nothing but another formulation of
the real canonical form for real linear maps.

an affine orthogonal group gives an automorphism that is not inner. Thus
performing the actual classification, as opposed to giving an in principle
classification, needs some care. We do the classification in the style of Bur-
goyne and Cushman [3], working with vector spaces instead of subgroups
or subvarieties. Again we encounter an unfamiliar modulus. Surprisingly,
once we have found representatives of coadjoint orbits, we see that there is
a bijection between the chosen representatives for adjoint orbits and those
employed for coadjoint orbits. This bijection preserves “dimension”, “in-
dex”, “modulus” and Jordan type. We have no geometric explanation for
it.
    We now give an overview of the contents of this paper. In section 2 we
show that the affine orthogonal group is isomorphic to a larger orthogonal
group, which leaves an isotropic vector v ◦ fixed. Throughout the remainder
of the paper we look only at this isotropy group. In section 3 we adapt the
notion of an indecomposable type to the case at hand and show that there
is a distinguished indecomposable type containing the vector v ◦ . In section
4 we classify these distinguished indecomposable types and complete the
classification of the adjoint orbits of the affine orthogonal group. In section
5 we apply the above theory to find normal forms for the adjoint orbits of
the Poincaré group. In section 6 we classify the coadjoint orbits of the affine
orthogonal group and in section 7 we specialize this to the coadjoint orbits
of the Poincaré group.

In this section we show that the affine orthogonal group can be realized as
an isotropy subgroup of a larger orthogonal group.

     Let γ

       e
of γe with respect to this basis is G = diag(−Im , Ip ), where Ir is the r × r
identity matrix. Let O(Ve , G) be the set of all linear maps B of Ve into itself
which preserve e  γ , that is, e               e(v, w) for every v, w ∈ Ve . Then
                                  γ (Bv, Bw) = γ
O(Ve , G) is a Lie group which is isomorphic to O(m, p). On V = R × Ve × R
consider the inner product γ defined by γ((x, v, y), (x′ , v ′ , y ′ )) = γ      e(v, v ′ ) +

                                             3
the set of all real linear maps A of V into itself which preserve γ, that is,
γ(A(x, v, y), A(x′ , v ′ , y ′ )) = γ((x, v, y), (x′ , v ′ , y ′ )).
     Now consider the isotropy subgroup
                      O(V, K)en+1 = {A ∈ O(V, K) Aen+1 = en+1 }
of O(V, K). To give a more explicit description of O(V, K)en+1 let A be an
invertible real linear map of V into itself such thatAen+1 = en+1

that the matrix of A with respect to the basis e is                         d       B      e .   Then A =
                                                                             f       gT     h
               
  a    bT    0
 d    B     0 ,     because A leaves the vector en+1 fixed. Now A ∈ O(V, K) if
  f    gT    1
and only if K = AT KA, that is,
                                                                          

where B T GB = G and d ∈ Rn . Thus A ∈ O(V, K)en+1 if and only if (1)
holds. The group O(V, K)en+1 is isomorphic to the affine orthogonal group
AffO(V, K), which is the semidirect product ⋉ of O(Rn , G) with Rn , that

3        Classification of adjoint orbits
To fix notation. Let v ◦ be a nonzero isotropic vector in the real inner product
space (V, γ). Let o(V, γ)v◦ be the Lie algebra of the affine orthogonal group

                  O(V, γ)v◦ = {A ∈ Gl(V ) Av ◦ = v ◦ and A∗ γ = γ}.

Then Y ∈ o(V, γ)v◦ if and only if

               Y v ◦ = 0 and γ(Y v, w) + γ(v, Y w) = 0, for all v, w ∈ V .

    We begin our classification of the adjoint orbits of the affine orthogonal
group O(V, γ)v◦ on its Lie algebra o(V, γ)v◦ by defining the notions of in-
decomposable type and indecomposable distinguished type. First we define
the notion of a pair. Let W be a γ-nondegenerate real vector space. Our
vector spaces are always finite dimensional. If Y ∈ o(W, γ) then (Y, W ; γ)
is a pair.4 We say that the pairs (Y, W ; γ) and (Y ′ , W ′ ; γ ′ ) are equivalent
if there is a bijective real linear map P : W → W ′ such that P Y = Y ′ P
and P ∗ γ ′ = γ, that is, γ ′ (P v, P w) = γ(v, w) for every v, w ∈ W . Clearly
being equivalent is an equivalence relation on the collection of pairs. An
equivalence class of pairs is a type, which we denote by ∆. Given a type ∆
with representative (Y, W ; γ) we define the dimension, denoted dim ∆, of ∆
by dim W and the index, denoted ind ∆, of ∆ by the number of negative
eigenvalues of the Gram matrix (γ(vi , vj )), where {v1 , . . . , vdim W } is a basis
of W . It is straightforward to check that neither of these notions depends on
the choice of representative of ∆ or on the choice of basis. Let Y = S + N
be the Jordan decomposition of Y into a semisimple linear map S and a
commuting nilpotent linear map N . Because S and N are polynomials in
Y with real coefficients and Y v ◦ = 0, it follows that Sv ◦ = N v ◦ = 0.
So S, N ∈ o(W, γ)v◦ . Let h be the unique nonnegative integer such that
N h W 6= {0} but N h+1 W = 0. We call h the height of the type ∆ and we
denote it by ht(∆). It is evident that ht(∆) does not depend of the choice of
representative of ∆. We say that a type ∆ with representative (Y, W ; γ) is
uniform if N W = ker N h |W . Let (Y, W ; γ) represent the type ∆. Suppose
that W = W1 + W2 , where Wi are proper, Y -invariant subspaces, which are
γ-nondegenerate and γ orthogonal. Then ∆ is the sum of two types ∆i ,
which are represented by (Y |Wi , Wi ; γ|Wi ). We write ∆ = ∆1 + ∆2 . The
type ∆ is indecomposable if it can not be written as the sum of two types.
From [3, prop. 3, p.343] it follows that an indecomposable type is uniform.
    4
        Our concept of pair is the same as that of [3].



                                                5
So far the vector v ◦ has not played any role. Therefore the classification of
indecomposable types is given by results in [3].
    We now define the notion of a triple, where the vector v ◦ plays an essen-
tial role. (Y, W, v ◦ ; γ) is a triple if and only if the vector v ◦ is nonzero and
γ-isotropic and for the linear map Y in the pair (Y, W ; γ) we have Y v ◦ = 0.
We say that the triple (Y, W, v ◦ ; γ) is a nilpotent triple if Y is nilpotent.
Two triples (Y, W, v ◦ ; γ) and (Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ; γ ′ ) are equivalent if there is a
bijective real linear map P : W → W ′ such that Y ′ P = P Y , P ∗ γ ′ = γ
and P v ◦ = (v ◦ )′ . Clearly being equivalent is an equivalence relation on the
collection of triples. We call an equivalence class of triples a distinguished
type, which we denote by ∆. Let (Y, W, v ◦ ; γ) represent the distinguished
type ∆. If Y is nilpotent, then ∆ is a nilpotent distinguished type. Sup-
pose that W = W1 ⊕ W2 , where Wi are proper, Y -invariant, γ-orthogonal,
γ-nondegenerate subspaces and v ◦ ∈ W1 . Then (Y |W1 , W1 , v ◦ ; γ|W1 ) is
a triple whose distinguished type we write ∆1 . Moreover, let the pair
(Y |W2 , W2 ; γ|W2 ) represent the type ∆2 . In this situation we say that the
distinguished type ∆ is the sum of the distinguished type ∆1 and the type
∆2 and we write ∆ = ∆1 + ∆2 . If ∆ can not be written as the sum of
a distinguished type and a type, then we say that ∆ is an indecomposable
distinguished type. In other words, (Y, W, v ◦ ; γ) represents an indecompos-
able distinguished type if there is no proper, γ-nondegenerate, Y -invariant
subspace of W which contains v ◦ . To simplify notation from now on we
usually drop the inner product γ in pairs and triples.
    The first goal of this paper is to prove

Theorem 1 Every distinguished type is a sum of an indecomposable nilpo-
tent distinguished type and a sum of indecomposable types. This decompo-
sition is unique up to a reordering of the summands.
    The proof of the theorem will require an understanding of indecompos-
able nilpotent distinguished types. Recall the indecomposable types have
already been classified in [3]. The theorem solves the conjugacy class prob-
lem for the Lie algebra o(v, γ)v◦ . Indeed distinguished types represented
by triples of the form (Y, V, v ◦ ; γ) correspond one to one with orbits of the
adjoint action on o(v, γ)v◦ .
   Before beginning the proof of theorem 1, we need some additional con-
cepts. Let ∆ be a distinguished type with representative (Y, W, v ◦ ). We
say that ∆ has distinguished height h, if h is the largest positive integer for



                                           6
which there is a vector w ∈ W such that Y h w = v ◦ . We denote the dis-
tinguished height of ∆ by dht(∆). Because the definition of distinguished
height does not involve the inner product γ and Y v ◦ = 0, there is a largest
Jordan block of the linear map Y which contains the vector v ◦ . Moreover,
it is of size h + 1. Let

        µ(∆) = {γ(w, v ◦ ) ∈ R for all w ∈ W such that Y h w = v ◦ }.

We call µ(∆) the set of parameters of the distinguished type ∆. Below we
will show that this set is a singleton.
    We prove

Lemma 2 Suppose that ∆ = ∆′ + ∆. Then dht(∆) = dht(∆′ ) and µ(∆) =
µ(∆′ ).
Proof. Suppose that (Y, W, v ◦ ) is a triple which represents the distinguished
type ∆ and that W = W1 ⊕ W2 , where Wi are proper, Y -invariant, γ-
orthogonal, γ-nondegenerate subspaces of W with v ◦ ∈ W1 . Say the triple
(Y |W1 , W1 , v ◦ ) represents a distinguished type ∆′ and the pair (Y |W2 , W2 )
represents the type ∆. Suppose that dht(∆′ ) = h′ . Then there is a vector
                          ′
w′ ∈ W1 such that Y h w′ = v ◦ . Consequently, dht(∆) ≥ h′ . Since dht(∆) =
h, there is a vector w ∈ W such that Y h w = v ◦ . But W = W1 ⊕ W2 . So
we may write w = w1 + w2 where wi ∈ Wi . Since Wi are Y -invariant, we
have v ◦ = Y h w1 + Y h w2 where Y h wi ∈ Wi . By construction v ◦ ∈ W1 .
Therefore Y h w1 = v ◦ . Consequently h ≤ dht(∆′ ) = h′ . So h = h′ . Note
that dim ∆ > dim ∆′ .
   Since W1 ⊆ W , it follows from the definition of the set of parameters
that µ(∆′ ) ⊆ µ(∆). Suppose that there is a vector w ∈ W with Y h w = v ◦
                     / µ(∆′ ). Write w = w1 + w2 where wi ∈ Wi . Then by
such that γ(w, v ◦ ) ∈
the argument in the preceding paragraph we find that Y h w1 = v ◦ . Since
W2 is γ-orthogonal to W1 and v ◦ ∈ W1 , we obtain

               γ(w, v ◦ ) = γ(w1 , v ◦ ) + γ(w2 , v ◦ ) = γ(w1 , v ◦ ).

But γ(w1 , v ◦ ) ∈ µ(∆′ ) by definition. This is a contradiction. Hence µ(∆′ ) =
µ(∆).                                                                          

Lemma 3 We may write ∆ = ∆′ + ∆ where the distinguished type ∆′ is
indecomposable and nilpotent.
Proof. If the distinguished type ∆′ is not indecomposable, we find another
distinguished type ∆′′ of the same distinguished height and parameters and

                                          7
a type ∆′ such that ∆′ = ∆′′ + ∆′ , where dim ∆′ > 0. Because dim ∆′ >
dim ∆′′ after a finite number of repetitions, we obtain a distinguished type
e which we can no longer write as a sum of a distinguished type and a type,
∆
namely, ∆ = ∆   e + ∆.
                     e In other words, ∆  e is an indecomposable distinguished
type. By lemma 2 it has the same distinguished height and parameters as
the distinguished type ∆.
    We now show that the indecomposable distinguished type ∆,      e represented
                 ◦
by (Y |W, W, v ), is nilpotent. Let W0 be the generalized eigenspace of Y |W
corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then W0 is Y -invariant, γ-nondegenerate
and contains v ◦ . On W0 the linear map Y is nilpotent. From the fact
that the distinguished type ∆   e is indecomposable, it follows that the triple
(Y |W0 , W0 , v ; γ) equals the triple (Y |W, W, v ◦ ; γ). Hence the indecompos-
               ◦

able distinguished type ∆  e is nilpotent.                                     


4        Indecomposable distinguished types
In this section we classify indecomposable distinguished types. We start
by giving a rough description of the possible indecomposable distinguished
types, which we then refine to a classification.
Let ∆ be a distinguished type. There are two cases:
   1. the set of parameters µ(∆) contains a nonzero parameter;
or
   2. µ(∆) = {0}.
Case 1. Suppose that the triple (Y, W, v ◦ ) represents the distinguished
type ∆, which we assume has distinguished height h. Using lemma 3 write
∆ = ∆′ + ∆, where ∆′ is an indecomposable distinguished type of distin-
guished height h represented by (Y |W1 , W1 , v ◦ ) with W1 a γ-nondegenerate,
Y -invariant subspace of W which contains v ◦ . Choose w ∈ W1 so that
Y h w = v ◦ and γ(w, v ◦ ) = µ 6= 0.5 Look at the subspace

                              f = span{w, Y w, . . . , Y h w}
                              W

                      f . On W
of W . Clearly v ◦ ∈ W      f consider the (h + 1) × (h + 1) Gram matrix
                                         
G = γ(Y w, Y w) = ± γ(w, Y i+j w) , since Y ∈ o(W, γ)v◦ . Because
           i     j

    5
        This implies that h is even. Suppose not. Then

                        γ(w, Y h w) = (−1)h γ(Y h w, w) = −γ(w, Y h w),

since γ is symmetric. Hence γ(w, Y h w) = 0, which is a contradiction.



                                              8
                                    f = 0. Therefore, all the entries of G
Y h+1 w = Y v ◦ = 0, we have Y h+1 |W
below the antidiagonal are 0. On the other hand, because

                  γ(Y i w, Y h−i w) = ±γ(w, Y h w) = ±µ 6= 0,

all the entries of G on the antidiagonal are nonzero. Hence det G 6= 0, that
    f is γ-nondegenerate. As ∆′ was assumed to be indecomposable, it
is, W
follows that W1 = W  f . Note that (Y |W
                                       f, W
                                          f , v ◦ ) has one Jordan block and
             ′
therefore ∆ is uniform. This completes case 1.
Case 2. Suppose that the triple (Y, W, v ◦ ) represents the distinguished
type ∆, which we assume has distinguished height h. Using lemma 3
write ∆ = ∆′ + ∆, where ∆′ is a nilpotent indecomposable distinguished
type of distinguished height h represented by (Y |W1 , W1 , v ◦ ) with W1 a
γ-nondegenerate, Y -invariant subspace of W which contains v ◦ . Consider
the pair (Y |W1 , W1 ) and the type ∆ e which it represents. From the results
                         e
of [3] we may write ∆ = ∆1 + · · · + ∆r , where ∆j are indecomposable
types uniform of height hj , sorted so that h1 ≤ h2 ≤ · · · ≤ hr . Suppose
that (Y |Wj , Wj ) represents ∆j . Then v ◦ is a sum of its components in
the Wj , but some of those components may be zero. Let W        c = Wk where
k is the smallest index such that v has a nonzero component vc
                                        ◦                                   c.
                                                                       ◦ in W

Consider the type (Y |W  c, W c ). Then Y |W
                                           c annihilates vc ◦ and the height of
    c   c                                               ′
(Y |W , W ) equals the distinguished height h of ∆ . Choose z ∈ W       c such
that γ(z, v ◦ ) = γ(z, vc
                        ◦ ) 6= 0. This is possible since Wc is γ-nondegenerate.
                              h     ◦
Choose w ∈ W1 so that Y w = v . Consider the Y -invariant subspace
                f = span{w, Y w, . . . Y h w; z, Y z, . . . , Y h z}.
                W

                                f = 0 and γ(z, Y h w) 6= 0 by definition of z
Let n = h + 1. Note that Y h+1 |W
                        h
and w. Moreover γ(w, Y w) = 0 since µ(∆) = {0} by hypothesis. Look at
the 2n × 2n Gram matrix
                                                                                       
               gi,j     gi,j+n                γ(Y i−1 w, Y j−1 w)   γ(Y i−1 w, Y j−1 z)
     G=                               =                                                       .
              gi+n,j   gi+n,j+n               γ(Y i−1 z, Y j−1 w)   γ(Y i−1 z, Y j−1 z)

The entries of G satisfy the following conditions: i) gi,j = gn+i,j = gi,n+j =
gn+i,n+j = 0, when i + j ≥ n + 2 and 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n; ii) gi,j+n = gi+n,j 6= 0,
where i + j = n + 1; iii) gi,j = 0, where i + j = n + 1. Thus G has its
nonzero entries on or above the antidiagonal of each n × n block except the
upper left hand one, where even the antidiagonal elements are zero. Thus



                                                9
the matrix G has the form
                                                                
                                     ∗       0    ∗          +
                                                              
                                                              
                                  0
                                            0    +          0 
                                                               ,
                                                            ∗ 
                                  ∗         +    ∗            
                                                              
                                     +       0     ∗         0
where + denotes a nonzero entry. Expanding det G by minors of the h + 1st
column, one sees that det G is a nonzero number times the [h + 2, h + 1]
minor. Expanding this minor by its last column gives a nonzero number
times a matrix with the same form as the original G but with one fewer row
and column. Clearly when G is a 2 × 2, we have det G 6= 0. By induction
we have
                      Q
Lemma 4 det G = ± 2n    k=1 gk,2n−k+1 6= 0.

    Thus Wf is a 2h + 2-dimensional, Y -invariant, γ nondegenerate subspace
of W1 , which contains the vector v ◦ . Since ∆′ is indecomposable, the triple
    f, W
(Y |W   f , v ◦ ) represents the distinguished type ∆′ . Note that ∆′ is made
up of two Jordan blocks of size h + 1 and hence is uniform. This completes
case 2 of the rough description of indecomposable distinguished types. 
   We now classify indecomposable distinguished types.

Proposition 5 Let ∆ be an indecomposable distinguished type of distin-
guished height h, which is represented by the triple (Y, W, v ◦ ). Then exactly
one of the following alternatives holds.
  1. h is even, h > 0, and there is a basis

                   {Y h z, −Y h−1 z, . . . , (−1)h z ; w, Y w, . . . , Y h w},                     (3)

      the notation ∆h (0, 0).

      the notation ∆+        −
                    h (0) + ∆h (0) .

Proof. Using our rough classification of distinguished indecomposable types,
let us prove the proposition.
    Suppose that we are in case 1 of the rough classification. Then ∆ is
represented by the triple (Y, W, v ◦ ) where W = span{w, Y w, . . . , Y h w} and
γ(w, Y h w) 6= 0. Hence h is even and h > 0 because v ◦ is isotropic, while
γ(w, Y h w) 6= 0. Since ∆ is uniform we may form W = W/Y W . Clearly,
dim W = 1. On W the inner product γ induces a symmetric bilinear form
γ defined by γ(v, v ′ ) = γ(v, Y h v ′ ). Since γ(w, Y h w) 6= 0, the vector w is
nonzero and forms a basis of Y . Rescaling, we may assume that γ(w, w) = ε,
where ε2 = 1. By [3, prop. 2, p.343] any uniform type is determined by its
height and its (W , γ), so we may choose a vector w ∈ W which generates
the basis (2) of case 1 of the proposition, γ-adapted in the sense that its
Gram matrix is as indicated in the proposition. Indeed such a γ-adapted
basis describes a type that has the required height and (W , γ). In terms
of this basis there is a unique nonzero number µ such that v ◦ = µ Y h w.
Replacing w with −w, if necessary, we can assume that µ > 0. We call µ a
modulus. We compute that

                        γ(µw, v ◦ ) = γ(µw, µw) = µ2 ε,

which shows that µ(∆) = {µ2 ε}. Thus µ(∆) determines µ and ε. So ∆ is
a distinguished indecomposable type made
                                    
                                         up of one Jordan block. More-
                                         h/2, if (−1)h/2 ε = 1
over, we have dim ∆ = h + 1, ind ∆ = h/2 + 1, if (−1)h/2 ε = −1 and ∆ has
distinguished height h and a unique modulus µ > 0. The type of (Y, W ) is
denoted ∆εh (0) in [3].
    Now suppose that we are in case 2 of the rough classification. Then the
distinguished type ∆ of distinguished height h is represented by the triple
(Y, W, v ◦ ) with

               W = span{w, Y w, . . . , Y h w, z, Y z, . . . , Y h z},

and v ◦ = Y h w. Moreover, γ(w, v ◦ ) = 0 and γ(z, v ◦ ) 6= 0. There are two
subcases.

                                         11
Suppose that h is odd. Since ∆ is uniform, we may form W = W/Y W . On
W the inner product γ induces a skew symmetric bilinear form γ defined
by γ(v, v ′ ) = γ(v, Y h v ′ ). Clearly, W = span{w, z} and from γ(w, z) 6= 0
it follows that W is γ nondegenerate. Up to isomorphism there is only
one nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form of dimension two, and it
is indecomposable. So W is γ indecomposable. Using [3, prop. 2, p.343]
again we may choose vectors w, z ∈ W which generate the γ-adapted basis
(3) of case 2 of the proposition. We now need to show that we can choose
this basis so that v ◦ = Y h w. We know      ′that

                                                                                          =

where ad − bd = 1. We now show that w′ and z ′ generate the γ-adapted
basis {Y h z ′ , −Y h−1 z ′ , . . . , (−1)h z ′ ; w′ , Y w′ , . . . , Y h w′ } of W . This follows
because for every j between 0 and h we have

                           γ(Y i w′ , Y j w′ ) = γ(Y i z ′ , Y j z ′ ) = 0

and

      γ(Y j w′ , (−1)j Y h−j z ′ ) = (−1)j γ(Y j (aw + bz), Y h−j (cw + dz))
                                    = γ(aw + bz, Y h (cw + dz))
                                    = ad γ(w, w) + bd γ(z, z) + (ad − bc)γ(w, z)
                                    = γ(w, z) = 1.

By construction v ◦ = Y h w′ . Summarizing, we have shown that ∆ is a
distinguished indecomposable type made up of two Jordan blocks. Also
dim ∆ = 2(h + 1), ind ∆ = h + 1 and ∆ has distinguished height h, which is
odd. The type of (Y, W ) is denoted ∆h (0, 0) in [3].
Suppose that h is even. Since ∆ is uniform, we may form W = W/Y W .
On W the inner product γ induces a symmetric bilinear form γ defined
by γ(v, v ′ ) = γ(v, Y h v ′ ). Since γ(z, Y h w) 6= 0 by hypothesis, we see that
γ(z, w) 6= 0 and W = span{z, w}. Therefore the reduced type (Y , W ; γ) is
not indecomposable. Since γ(w, Y h w) =        0, the vector w is a nonzero and
                            1         γ(z,z)
γ-isotropic. Let y = γ(z,w) z − 2γ(z,w) w . Then y is a γ-isotropic vector in
W and γ(y, w) = 1. Thus the matrix of γ with respect to the basis {y, w}
is 01 10 . Using [3, prop. 2, p.343] we may choose vectors w,
                                                           e ze ∈ W which
generate the γ-adapted basis (4) of case 3 of the proposition. We now need to
show that we can choose this basis so that v ◦ = Y h w.
                                                      e Since v ◦ ∈ ker Y |W ,

                                                12
we see that v ◦ ∈ span{Y h w, e Y h ze}. Now write v ◦ = Y h (αw   e + βe z ). As
γ(αwe + βe     ◦
          z , v ) = 2αβ ∈ µ(∆) = {0}, we must have α = 0 or β = 0. If
v ◦ = α Y h w,
            e where α 6= 0, then put z ′ = α−1 ze, w′ = αw.   e If v ◦ = β Y h ze
with β 6= 0 then put z ′ = β −1 w,
                                e w′ = βe z . In either case v ◦ = Y h w′ and

             {Y h z ′ , −Y h−1 z ′ , . . . , (−1)h z ′ ; w′ , Y w′ , . . . , Y h w′ }
                                                                                         
                                                                             0     Ih+1
is a basis of W with respect to which the matrix of γ is                    Ih+1     0
                                                                                              . Note ∆
is a distinguished indecomposable type made up of two Jordan blocks. Also
dim ∆ = 2(h+1) with ind ∆ = h+1 and ∆ has distinguished height h, which
is even. The type of (Y, W ) is decomposable and is denoted ∆+            −
                                                                 h (0) + ∆h (0)
in [3].
    One may look at the above computation as exploiting the fact that there
is an action of O(W , γ) on ker Y |W . In the last two cases the action has
only one orbit of nonzero isotropic vectors, while in the first case there are
moduli. The action can be understood in terms of the Jacobson Morozov
theorem.
   The three cases are obviously exclusive. Note that one can distinguish
them by dht(∆) and µ(∆). This proves proposition 5.                   
Proof of theorem 1 Let ∆ be a distinguished type. By lemma 3 we may
write ∆ = ∆ e + ∆ where the distinguished type ∆   e is indecomposable and
nilpotent. By the main result of [3, theorem, p.343] applied to ∆, we can
write
                        ∆=∆  e + ∆1 + · · · + ∆r ,                      (5)
where ∆i for 1 ≤ i ≤ r are indecomposable types. By lemma 2 ∆  e is of
the same distinguished height and parameters as ∆. Suppose that ∆ has
another such decomposition, namely

                                 e ′ + ∆′1 + · · · + ∆′s ,
                               ∆=∆                                                                 (6)
         ′
where ∆   e is an indecomposable distinguished type and ∆′ for 1 ≤ j ≤ s
                                                                   j
are indecomposable types. By lemma 2 the distinguished height, say h,
of ∆e and ∆      e ′ are the same. Say that ∆           e ′ are represented by the
                                                  e and ∆
triples (Y, W, v ◦ ) and (Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ). Suppose that h is odd. Then the
linear map P : W → W ′ for which P Y i w = (Y ′ )i w′ and P Y i z = (Y ′ )i z ′
where 0 ≤ i ≤ h and w, z and w′ , z ′ are vectors given in the basis (3)
of case 2 of proposition 5 is an equivalence between the triples (Y, W, v ◦ )
and (Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ). Next suppose that h is even and that (Y, W, v ◦ ) and
(Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ) have one Jordan chain. Since by lemma 2 the parameters of

                                               13
∆e and ∆e ′ are the same, using the basis (2) of case 1 of proposition 5 we
can again construct an equivalence between ∆     e and ∆    e ′ . We can also handle
the case when h is even and (Y, W, v ◦ ) and (Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ) have two Jordan
chains. Thus in every case (Y, W, v ◦ ) and (Y ′ , W ′ , (v ◦ )′ ) are equivalent, that
    e =∆
is, ∆   e ′.

    Now we need only show that r = s and ∆i = ∆′i . But this follows
from the the main result of [3, theorem, p.343], because ∆1 + · · · ∆r and
∆′1 + · · · ∆′s are sums of indecomposable types, while ∆ e =∆  e ′ implies that
the underlying types of ∆  e and ∆e ′ are equal. This proves theorem 1.       


5    Adjoint orbits of the Poincaré group
In this section we use the above theory to determine the orbits of the adjoint
action of the Poincaré group on its Lie algebra.
    Let G = diag(−1, −1, −1, 1) be the matrix of a Lorentz inner product
on R4 with respect to the standard basis {e1 , . . . , e4 }. The Poincare group
is the affine Lorentz group, which is the semidirect product O(3, 1) ⋉ R4
of the Lorentz group O(3, 1) = O(R4 , G) with the abelian group R4 . In §2
we have shown that the Poincaré group is the isotropy group O(R6 , K)e5
of the orthogonal group O(R6 , K), where the matrix of the inner product
K with respect to the basis {e0 , e1 , . . . , e4 , e5 } of R6 is standard. The Lie
algebra of the Poincaré group is isomorphic to the Lie algebra o(R6 , K)e5
of O(R6 , K)e5 . All the conjugacy classes in o(R6 , K)e5 are given in table 3
below.
   First we list all the possible o(R6 , K)e5 -indecomposable distinguished
types, meaning indecomposable distinguished types that may occur as sum-
mand of some (Y, R6 , e5 ; K).
    Note we express v ◦ using the basis given in proposition 5.
    We now show that all the possible indecomposable distinguished types
are listed in table 1 below. The possible eigenvalue combinations are 0 0; 0;
and 0 + 0. Here, for instance, 0 + 0 stands for a decomposable two dimen-
sional (Y , W ; γ) with eigenvalue zero for each summand. The corresponding
heights and signs are 1; 4± , 2± ; and 0. So table 1 lists all the possibilities.
   Next in table 2 below we list the possible o(R6 , K)e5 -indecomposable
types, see [3, table II, p.349]. That is, we look for types that occur as

proper summand of some (Y, R6 ; K). We do not claim they all actually
occur in the setting of theorem 1.
Note in table 2 we have used the notation ∆m (ζ, CQ) = ∆m (ζ, −ζ, ζ, −ζ),
ζ 6= ±ζ, ∆m (ζ, RP) = ∆m (ζ, −ζ), ζ = ζ 6= 0, ∆m (ζ, IP) = ∆m (ζ, −ζ), ζ =
−ζ 6= 0, where ζ is the complex eigenvalue of Y with (Y, W ; K) a represen-
tative of the o(R6 , K)-indecomposable type. For instance, ∆m (ζ, −ζ, ζ, −ζ)
has height m and four eigenvalues on W .
     We now show that all the possible o(R6 , K)e5 -indecomposable types are
listed in table 2. For each eigenvalue combination we have the following
possibilities for the heights and the signs, because the dimension is at most
five.

This gives a total of fourteen cases, two of which are covered by case 5. Thus
table 2 is complete.
   Next we combine a given distinguished type in table 1 with a sum of
o(R6 , K)e5 -indecomposable types from table 2 so that their dimensions add
up to 6 and their indices add up to 4. This gives the entries in table 3.

    Below we show how to find explicit normal forms from the decompo-
sition into an indecomposable distinguished o(R6 , K)e5 -type and a sum of
indecomposable o(R6 , K)e5 -types given in table 3. We do this for one case
just to give the idea.

Example 6 ∆−           −
           4 (0), α + ∆0 (0).

Write R6 = V1 ⊕ V2 , where V1 and V2 are Y -invariant, K-orthogonal,
o(R6 , K)e5 -indecomposable subspaces where (V1 , Y |V1 ) ∈ ∆−   4 (0), e5 ∈ V1 ,
                     −
and (V2 , Y |V2 ) ∈ ∆0 (0). Now Y = N is nilpotent on V1 and V2 . Choose a
basis
                        {v1 , N v1 , −N 4 v1 , N 3 v1 ; N 2 v1 }
of V1 as in case 1 of proposition 5. Note that v ◦ = αN 4 v1 with α > 0. Also
there is a vector v2 in V2 such that K(v2 , v2 ) = −1. With respect to the
basis

{e0 , . . . , e5 } = {−α−1 v1 ,   1
                                  2   N v1 − N 3 v1 , N 2 v1 , v2 ,       1

6    Classification of coadjoint orbits
Our next aim is to determine a representative of each orbit of the coadjoint
action
                                     ∗                   ∗
       O(R6 , K)e5 × o(R6 , K)e5 → o(R6 , K)e5 : (P, Y ∗ ) 7→ Y ∗ ◦ AdP −1
                                                                          ∗
of the Poincaré group O(R6 , K)e5 on the dual o(R6 , K)e5 of its Lie algebra.
More generally, we classify the coadjoint orbits of an affine orthogonal group.
As before, it is essential to our method that the affine orthogonal group
is viewed as an isotropy subgroup. Instead of types we will now employ
cotypes.
    As always, the pair (V, γ) is a finite dimensional real vector space with
a nondegenerate inner product γ. When K is the Gram matrix of γ with
respect to some basis, we often write K for γ. For a vector v in V let
v ∗ be the linear function on V given by w 7→ γ(v, w). A tuple (V, Y, v; γ)
is a pair (V, γ), a real linear map Y ∈ o(V, γ) and a vector v ∈ V . On
the collection of all tuples we say that the tuple (V, Y, v; γ) is equivalent to
the tuple (V ′ , Y ′ , v ′ ; γ ′ ) if and only if there is a bijective real linear map
P : V → V ′ such that (i ) P ∗ γ ′ = γ, (ii ) P v = v ′ , and (iii ) there is a vector
w ∈ V such that Y ′ = P (Y + Lw,v )P −1 , where Lw,v = w ⊗ v ∗ − v ⊗ w∗ .

Fact 7 Lw,v ∈ o(V, γ).                                                              ✷

Fact 8 If P ∈ O(V, γ), then P Lw,v P −1 = LP w,P v .                                ✷

    Being equivalent is an equivalence relation on the collection of tuples.
An equivalence class is a cotype, which is denoted by ∇. If (V, Y, v; γ) is a
representative of ∇, then define the dimension of ∇ to be dim V and denote
it by dim ∇. Clearly, the notion of dimension is well defined. A cotype is
affine if it has a representative (V, Y, v; γ), where v is a nonzero, γ-isotropic
vector.
    Suppose that we are in the situation of §2, where V = R × Ve × R is a
real vector space with nondegenerate inner product γ defined by

                  γ((x, ve, y), (x′ , ve′ , y ′ )) = γ v , ve′ ) + x′ y + y ′ x,
                                                     e(e

where γe is a nondegenerate inner product on Ve . Suppose that with re-
spect to the standard basis e = {e0 , e1 , . . . , en , en+1 } of V the matrix of γ


                                               18

                               where G is the matrix of γ
          1      0       0
ee = {e1 , . . . en } of Ve .
    The following proposition explains the relevance of affine cotypes. See
also proposition 13 below.
    For Y ∈ o(V, γ) let ℓY be the linear function on o(V, γ) which maps Z
to tr Y Z. Observe that the map o(V, γ) → o(V, γ)∗ : Y 7→ ℓY is bijective.

Proposition 9 The map

                                (V, Y, en+1 ; K) 7→ ℓY |o(V, K)en+1                    (7)

induces a bijection between affine cotypes on (V, K) and coadjoint orbits of
O(V, K)en+1 on the dual o(V, K)∗en+1 of its Lie algebra.
Proof. The argument is a series of observations.
    Suppose that the tuples (V, Y, en+1 ; K) and (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) are equiva-
lent. Then there is a real linear map P ∈ O(V, K)en+1 and a vector w ∈ V
such that Y ′ = P (Y + Lw,en+1 )P −1 .
Observation 1. The matrix of Lw,en+1 with respect to the standard basis

                                               where w = w0 e0 + w
                      0         eT G
                               −w      −w0

Proof. We compute

      Lw,en+1 (e0 ) = (eTn+1 Ke0 )w − (wT Ke0 )en+1 = w − wn+1 en+1 =
                                     e
                           = w0 e0 + w;

  Lw,en+1 (en+1 ) = (eTn+1 Ken+1 )w − (wT Ken+1 )en+1 = −w0 en+1 .                     ✷

Observation 2. For P ∈ O(V, K) and Y ∈ o(V, K) we have

                                ℓP Y P −1 = AdTP −1 ℓY := ℓY ◦ AdP −1 .

Observation 3. Let o(V, K)0en+1 be the set of all ℓX ∈ o(V, K)∗ such that
ℓX (Y ) = tr XY = 0 for every Y ∈ o(V, K)en+1 . Then

          o(V, K)0en+1 = {ℓLv,en+1 ∈ o(V, K)∗ v = v0 e0 + ve ∈ V }.               (8)

which equals the dimension of the subspace of o(V, K)∗ spanned by covectors
of the form ℓLv,een+1 with v = v0 e0 + ve ∈ V . Consequently, equation (8)
holds.                                                                  
    Now we are in position to prove proposition 9. Supppose that the tuples
(V, Y, en+1 ; K) and (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) are equivalent. Then there is a P ∈
O(V, K)en+1 and a vector w ∈ V such that Y ′ = P (Y + Lw,en+1 )P −1 . For




                                              20
every Z ∈ o(V, K)en+1 we have

       ℓY ′ (Z) = ℓP (Y +Lw,en+1 )P −1 (Z) = ℓP Y P −1 (Z) + ℓP Lw,en+1 P −1 (Z)
                = ℓP Y P −1 (Z) + ℓLP w,en+1 (Z),     since P ∈ O(V, K)en+1
                = ℓP Y P −1 (Z),   since Z ∈ o(V, K)en+1
                = (AdTP −1 ℓY )(Z) = AdTP −1 (ℓY |o(V, K)en+1 )(Z).
So the affine cotype represented by the tuple (V, Y, en+1 ; K) corresponds to
the coadjoint orbit of O(V, K)en+1 through ℓY |o(V, K)en+1 in o(V, K)∗en+1 .
Thus the map induced by (7) exists.
    Suppose that for some Y, Y ′ ∈ o(V, K) and some P ∈ O(V, K)en+1
we have ℓY ′ − AdTP −1 ℓY = 0 on o(V, K)en+1 . In other words, we sup-
pose that ℓY ′ |o(V, K)en+1 lies in the O(V, K)en+1 coadjoint orbit through
ℓY |o(V, K)en+1 . Then ℓY ′ −P Y P −1 ∈ o(V, K)0en+1 . Therefore for some v ∈ V
we have ℓY ′ −P Y P −1 = ℓLv,en+1 . So

               Y ′ = P Y P −1 + Lv,en+1 = P (Y + LP −1 v,en+1 )P −1 .
Hence the tuples (V, Y, en+1 ; K) and (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) are equivalent. Thus
the coadjoint orbit of O(V, K)en+1 on o(V, K)∗en+1 determines a unique affine
cotype. Therefore the map induced by (7) is injective.
      Since every element of o(V, K)∗en+1 is of the form ℓY |o(V, K)en+1 for some
Y ∈ o(V, K), the map induced by (7) is surjective.                              
      Suppose that we are given the affine cotype ∇ with representative (Vb , Yb ,

Here y0 ∈ R, ve, ye ∈ Ve , Ye ∈ o(Ve , G), and ve∗ = v T G. We say that the cotype
∇ℓ , represented by (Ve , Ye , ve; G), is the little cotype of ∇.6

Lemma 10 The little cotype ∇ℓ does not depend on the choice of repre-
sentative of the affine cotype ∇.
   6
    The cotype ∇ℓ is called the little cotype because we are imitating the little subgroup
approach of Wigner [9] to the representation theory of the Poincaré group.

Proof. Up to isomorphism (Ve , G) is determined by ∇, so there is no need
to vary G or K. Let (V, Y, en+1 ; K) be a representative of the affine cotype
∇. Suppose that (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) is another representative. Then there is a
P ∈ O(V, K)en+1 and a vector w ∈ V such that

                                Y ′ = P (Y + Lw,en+1 )P −1 .                             (10)

represented by the tuple (Ve , Ye ′ , ve′ ; G), which does not depend on the vector
w. Since Ye ′ = A(Ye + L−A−1 ue,ev )A−1 and ve′ = Ae      v , the tuple (Ve , Ye ′ , ve′ ; G)
is equivalent to the tuple (Ve , Ye , ve; G). But this tuple depends only on the
representative (V, Y, en+1 ; K) and not the representative (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) of
the cotype ∇. So the little cotype ∇ℓ does not depend on the choice of
representative of the affine cotype ∇.                                                      ✷

In other words, the tuples (V, Y, en+1 ; K) and (V, Y ′ , en+1 ; K) are equivalent.

   The following proposition follows immediately from the above.

Proposition 13 There is a bijection between little cotypes and coadjoint
orbits.
    Let ∇ be a cotype represented by the tuple (V, Y, v; γ). Suppose that
V = V1 ⊕ V2 , where Vi are Y -invariant, γ-nondegenerate and γ-orthogonal
subspaces such that V2 6= {0} and v ∈ V1 . Then we say that ∇ is a sum
of the cotype ∇,e represented by the tuple (V1 , Y |V1 , v; γ|V1 ), and a type ∆,
represented by (Y |V2 , V2 ; γ|V2 ). We write ∇ = ∇  e + ∆. If V1 = {0}, then
             e
v = 0 and ∇ is the zero cotype, represented by the tuple ({0}, 0, 0; 0) and
denoted by 0. We say the a cotype is indecomposable if it cannot be written
as the sum of a cotype and a type. A nonzero cotype ∇, represented by the
tuple (V, Y, v; γ) is decomposable if there is a proper, Y -invariant subspace of
V , which contains the vector v and on which γ is nondegenerate. Conversely,
if ∇ is decomposable, then there is a representative (V, Y, v; γ) so that there
is a proper, Y -invariant subspace of V , which contains the vector v and on
which γ is nondegenerate. Let us call such a representative adapted to the
decomposition.

Lemma 14 Every cotype, which is not affine, is the sum of a unique inde-
composable cotype, which is either the zero cotype or a nonzero 1-dimensional
cotype, and a type.
Proof. Let (V, Y, v; γ) represent the nonaffine cotype ∇. Suppose that
v = 0. Write V = {0} ⊕ V . Then {0} and V are Y -invariant, γ-orthogonal,
and γ-nondegenerate. Hence ∇ is the sum of the zero cotype 0 and a type
∆, represented by (Y, V ; γ). Now suppose that v 6= 0. Because ∇ is not
affine, v is not γ-isotropic, that is, γ(v, v) = ε α2 , where ε2 = 1 and α > 0.

Lemma 15 Every affine cotype can be written as a sum of an indecompos-
able affine cotype and a sum of indecomposable types. This decomposition
is unique up to reordering of the summands which are types.
Proof. Suppose that we are given an affine cotype ∇. Then ∇ is uniquely
determined by its little cotype ∇ℓ , where dim ∇ℓ < dim ∇. This correspon-
dence respects decomposition: if ∇ℓ is decomposable, then reconstructing
∇ as in the remark above, one finds that ∇ is decomposable. Conversely, if
∇ is decomposable, then using a representative adapted to a decomposition
one finds that ∇ℓ is decomposable. If ∇ℓ is again affine, we look at its little
cotype. Repeating this process a finite number of times, we obtain either
the zero cotype and we stop or we obtain a nonzero cotype ∇   b which is not
                       b                               e
affine. By lemma 14 ∇ is a unique sum of a cotype ∇, which is either the

                                                25
zero cotype or a nonzero 1-dimensional cotype and a type ∆. By results
of [3], the type ∆ is a sum of indecomposable types, which is unique up to
reordering the summands. This completes the proof of the lemma.        ✷

     eT1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0). Note that as a nilpotent matrix, Y has just one
     Jordan block. We use the notation ∇εn (0), µ for the cotype ∇.
Proof. One easily checks that the given representatives do indeed define
cotypes ∇n (0, 0) and ∇εn (0), µ respectively. Computing their little cotypes
one finds that the little cotype of ∇εn (0), µ is ∇εn−2 (0), µ. And the little
cotype of ∇n (0, 0) is ∇n−2 (0, 0). Consider an indecomposable affine cotype
of dimension n. As a cotype is uniquely determined by its little cotype, and
this little cotype must thus also be indecomposable, it is either affine, and
we may argue by induction, or it has dimension at most one and is described
easily.                                                                     ✷

                                                  26
Remark 17 It is noteworthy that we could choose the representatives in-
proposition 16 to have nilpotent Y .

Remark 18 (The curious bijection) There is a curious bijection between
the representatives that we choose here for indecomposable affine cotypes
and the representatives that we used for indecomposable distinguished types
in proposition 5. The bijection preserves dimension, index, modulus, and
Jordan type. It follows that we also get a bijection between affine cotypes
and distinguished types with the same underlying (V ; γ). In other words,
we get a bijection between adjoint orbits and coadjoint orbits for any affine
orthogonal group.


7    Coadjoint orbits of the Poincaré group
In this section we use the theory of §6 to classify the coadjoint orbits of the
Poincaré group O(4, 2)e5 .

    Let (V, γ) be a real vector space with a nondegenerate inner product γ of
signature (m, p) = (4, 2). Suppose that the tuple (V, Y ′ , v; γ) represents an
affine cotype in O(V, γ). Since O(V, γ) acts transitively on the collection of
nonzero γ-isotropic vectors in V , there is a P ∈ O(V, γ) such that P v = e5 .
Hence the tuple (V, Y = P Y ′ P −1 , e5 ; γ) is equivalent to (V, Y, v; γ). Because
e5 is γ-isotropic and γ is nondegenerate on V , there is a γ-isotropic vector
e0 ∈ V such that γ(e0 , e5 ) = 1. In other words, H = span{e0 , e5 } is a
hyperbolic plane in V . Because γ|H is nondegenerate, we can extend {e0 , e5 }
to a γ-orthonormal basis e ={e0 , e1 , .. . , e4 , e5 } of V such that the matrix
                                 0   0   1
of γ with respect to e is K =0      G   0,   where GT = G, G2 = I, and G has
                                 1   0   0
signature (1, 3). Thus using the basis e the tuple (V, Y, e5 ; γ) is the tuple
(V, Y, e5 ; K).
    Without loss of generality we can begin with an affine cotype ∇ in

where y0 ∈ R, x   e, ye ∈ R4 , and Ye T G + GYe = 0, that is, Ye ∈ o(R4 , G).
By proposition 15 we can write ∇ = ∇      e + ∆, where the possible indecom-
posable affine cotypes ∇  e in o(V, K) are listed in table 4, and the possible
indecomposable summands of the o(V, K) type ∆ are listed in table 5.
    Therefore the possible decompositions of the affine cotype ∇ into a sum
of an indecomposable affine cotype ∇   e and a sum of indecomposable types is
given in table 6.


8       Normal forms
We now give a table of explicit tuples (R6 , Y, e5 ; K) which represent the
corresponding affine cotypes listed in table 6.
     In our list of normal forms we use the following conventions. Let e =
{e0 , e1 , . . . , e4 , e5 } be the standard

of the inner product is K =0             G      0,   where G =     0        1
                                                                                 .   We call K the

standard form of the inner product γ on R6 and G the standard form of the
Lorentz inner product on R4 with standard basis ee = {e1 , . . . , e4 }.
       If Y ∈ o(R6 , K), then the matrix of Y with respect to the standard basis
