                                                    Abstract. We study branching laws for a classical group G and a symmetric subgroup
                                                    H. Our approach is through the branching algebra, the algebra of covariants for H in the
                                                    regular functions on the natural torus bundle over the flag manifold for G. We give concrete
                                                    descriptions of certain subalgebras of the branching algebra using classical invariant theory.
                                                    In this context, it turns out that the ten classes of classical symmetric pairs (G, H) are
                                                    associated in pairs, (G, H) and (H ′ , G′ ), and that the (partial) branching algebra for (G, H)
                                                    also describes a branching law from H ′ to G′ . (However, the second branching law may
                                                    involve certain infinite-dimensional highest weight modules for H ′ .) To highlight the fact
                                                    that these algebras describe two branching laws simultaneously, we call them reciprocity
                                                    algebras. Our description of the reciprocity algebras reveals that they all are related to
                                                    the tensor product algebra for GLn . This relation is especially strong in the stable range.
                                                    We provide explicit descriptions of reciprocity algebras in the stable range in terms of the
                                                    tensor product algebra for GLn . This is the structure lying behind formulas for branching
                                                    multiplicities in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

                                               One of the basic problems in the study of transformation groups and finite dimensional
                                            representation theory is the branching problem: describing how irreducible representations of
                                            a compact group (mutatis mutandis, a reductive complex algebraic group) decompose when
                                            restricted to a subgroup. More specifically, given a group G and a subgroup H, we may
                                            consider the branching problem for the pair (G, H). This paper introduces and establishes
                                            some basic features of an approach to the branching problem for a class of particularly
                                            interesting cases: the classical symmetric pairs, in which the group G is a classical group
                                            and the subgroup H is a symmetric subgroup - the fixed points of an involution of G. One
                                            can organize these pairs in 10 families, listed in table I (see page 19).
                                               There is already a substantial literature on branching rules for classical symmetric pairs
                                            [1], [2], [3], [4], [8], [9], [10], [11], [14], [16], [17], [19], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31],
                                            [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [39], [41], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [50], [49], [54], [55], [56],
                                            [61], [65],
                                            [66], [69].
                                               A substantial portion of this work is combinatorial in nature, and is formulated in terms
                                            of tableaux and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This approach began with the work of
                                            Littlewood and Richardson [48] [9] on tensor products of representations of GLn and Little-
                                            wood’s Restriction Formula [50] [49] for restriction of certain representations of GLn to the
                                            orthogonal group or the symplectic group. More recent work in this tradition includes [61],

   A group G embedded diagonally in the product G×G is a symmetric subgroup, correspond-
ing to the involution which exchanges the two copies of G. An irreducible representation
of G × G is just a tensor product ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 of irreducible representations of G. Thus, the
branching problem for symmetric pairs includes the tensor product problem - to describe
how a tensor product of representations of a group G decomposes into irreducible pieces. In
the 1990s, striking progress on the tensor product problem came from an unexpected source
– the theory of quantum groups (see [7, 20–22]).
   Quantum groups are one-parameter deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a
semisimple Lie algebra. The extra parameter was used by Lusztig ([51]) and Kashiwara ([23])
to define bases (“canonical bases” or “crystal bases”) for these algebras. The properties of
these bases permitted combinatorial descriptions of tensor product multiplicities, providing
an extension of the Littlewood-Richardson Rule for GLn to all simple groups. This approach
has been elucidated and simplified by the path model of Littelmann (see [44–47]), which also
provides branching rules for restriction from a group G to the Levi component of a parabolic
subgroup.
   This paper takes another approach to the branching problem for classical symmetric pairs.
Its main tool is invariant theory, represented primarily by the geometric version of highest
weight theory (see [10], [14] and [6]) and by classical invariant theory [10, 14, 66]. (At the
moment, parts of our development also depend on the combinatorial theory of the Littlewood-
Richardson Rule. However, our approach also suggests alternative approaches to these re-
sults, and we hope eventually to obtain independent proofs.) To describe the branching rule
for a classical symmetric pair (G, H), we study a naturally defined algebra B(G, H), which
we call the branching algebra for the pair (G, H). The algebra B(G, H) carries a multigrad-
ing by Â+        +
           G × ÂH , the semigroups of dominant weights of G and H. The dimension of the
homogeneous component B(G, H)(φ,ψ) labeled by (φ, ψ) ∈ Â+            +
                                                                G × ÂH equals the multiplicity
of ρψ in ρφ , where ρφ (respectively, ρψ ) is the irreducible representation of G with highest
weight φ (respectively, irreducible representation of H, with highest weight ψ). Branching
algebras were studied in [69], but have been mostly neglected since.
   In addition to the full branching algebras, our theory distinguishes certain families of
graded subalgebras, depending on integer parameters. For a certain range of the parameters,
the subalgebras have a particularly simple structure. We call this the stable range, and the
resulting algebras, stable branching algebras.
   This approach must of course give the same numbers as are produced by the combinato-
rial, quantum group and path model methods. We have already shown in [16] how to use
branching algebras systematically to express stable branching multiplicities for all families
of classical symmetric pairs in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
   We feel that branching algebras have several virtues in addition to providing an efficient
route to formulas for branching multiplicities. One is, they provide finer information than
multiplicities: they provide highest weight vectors. Indeed, the homogeneous component
B(G, H)(φ,ψ) of B(G, H) consists of the ψ-highest weight vectors for H in a specific realization
of the representation ρφ of G. Thus, if one understands B(G, H) well enough, one gets
information about how H-modules sit inside G-modules. For the classical symmetric pairs,
this possibility can in fact be realized: in [17], the authors have shown how to construct an
                                               2
explicit basis for the GLn tensor product algebra. In further work, Howe and Lee [15] have
extended this construction to apply to most of the families of branching algebras.
   A second positive feature of branching algebras is, they collect all multiplicity information
into one coherent structure. This has several potential implications. For example, it has
been observed in many cases that branching multiplicities can be interpreted as the number
of integral points in certain convex polytopes. The theory of SAGBI bases ([58]) provides a
strategy for attaching lattices cones to affine algebras. The explicit bases mentioned above
permit one to realize the SAGBI strategy effectively. The insight gained into the structure
of branching algebras allows one in turn to predict the existence of convex polytopes whose
integral points define the desired multiplicities [2], [3], [42], [43].
   The algebra structure also provides natural connections between the different branching
algebras. The stable branching algebras for all 10 families of classical symmetric pairs are
closely related to each other, and in particular, they all can be described in terms of the
GLn branching algebra. These relationships lie behind the various formulas expressing stable
multiplicities for all families in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients [16].
   These connections in fact go beyond branching algebras. By some remarkable coincidences,
there are also very close relationships between branching algebras for classical symmetric
pairs and classical Kostant-Rallis actions (see [40], [67], [68]). By a Kostant-Rallis action,
we mean the complexified action of H on g/h, where H is a maximal compact subgroup of a
semisimple Lie group G, and g and h are the Lie algebras of G and H respectively. Some key
results about these actions were given in [40]. but some aspects of their structure are still not
completely settled. The tight connection of classical Kostant-Rallis actions with branching
algebras can be used to improve understanding of these important examples. Beyond these
immediate applications. branching algebras should provide a useful general tool for analyzing
group actions.
   We also feel that the branching algebra approach sheds light on some of the basic con-
structions of the combinatorial theory. For example, the combinatorial description tensor
product multiplicities for GLn by means of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux still has an air
of mystery about it. A number of experts have remarked on the curious circumstance that,
although tensor product multiplicities are obviously symmetric in the two tensor factors,
the Littlewood-Richardson description of multiplicities is not symmetric. The SAGBI basis
description of the GLn tensor product algebra [17] provides a natural interpretation of the
information encoded by a Littlewood-Richardson tableau, including providing a straightfor-
ward context for the asymmetrical treatment of the two factors.
   The efficient packaging of all multiplicity formulas for a given pair in one algebraic structure
also seems to provide an efficient way of computing explicit results in low rank examples.
The authors hope to treat a collection of explicit cases in a future publication.
   Finally, although the branching algebra construction is not limited to symmetric pairs, it
has a remarkable additional feature in the case of classical symmetric pairs. As explained in
[11] [12], classical invariant theory gives rise to natural correspondences between representa-
tions of pairs (“dual pairs”) of classical groups. It turns out that these correspondences can
be refined to correspondences between branching laws for symmetric pairs. The 10 families
of classical symmetric pairs pair up into 5 families of pairs of pairs (see Table II on page 19),
in such a way that a branching algebra for one pair can also be interpreted as a branching
algebra for the corresponding pair. Thus, one branching algebra simultaneously describes

                                                 3
branching between representations of two classical symmetric pairs. This can be thought of
as a reciprocity law, analogous to Frobenius Reciprocity in the theory of group representa-
tions. Hence we call these branching algebras reciprocity algebras. (Multiplicity versions of
these reciprocity laws are implicitly included in the general result of [11]). We should also
remark that in most cases, the relevant representations for some of the groups involved in the
pairs will be infinite dimensional. However, the infinite dimensional representations which
occur are of a very special sort, and share many of the characteristics of finite-dimensional
representations.)
   For all the above reasons, we hope that branching algebras will serve as a useful comple-
ment to the already developed approaches to describing branching laws.

1.1. Overview. We will give the construction of a branching algebra in the following sec-
tion. We shall illustrate how the algebra structure emphasizes the coherence of the branch-
ing problem across representations of G, rather than simply providing a representation-by-
representation answer. Further, the algebra structure goes beyond the numerical nature of
multiplicities, and is the basis of some of the well-known multiplicity results.
   There are three main parts to this paper:
    (a) Background: preliminary knowledge on multiplicity-free spaces, the theory of dual
        pairs and the classification of classical symmetric pairs, leading to the concept of
        reciprocity algebra. One can group the classical symmetric pairs into 10 families,
        and it turns out that these families are associated in pairs, (G, H) and (H ′ , G′ ) (see
        Tables I and II), and that the branching algebra for (G, H) also describes a branching
        law from H ′ to G′ . Hence, we call the algebra that describes the two related branching
        laws a reciprocity algebra.
    (b) Reciprocity: explaining the underpinnings of the reciprocity of multiplicities for
        the 5 pairs of reciprocity algebras, with detailed discussions for certain representative
        pairs.
    (c) Stability: describing the branching algebra for a symmetric pair (G, H) in terms of
        a GLn tensor product algebra. This emphasizes the underlying importance of the
        GLn branching algebras, since their structure relate to all others. This phenomenon
        is also the basis for the expression of multiplicity formulas for representations of
        classical groups in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients - a recurring theme in
        the literature. The present paper brings more structure to these multiplicity results.
   The first four sections provide the necessary background:
    §3: We provide the notations for the parametrization of representations in §3.1. Next,
        we discuss some preliminary concepts on multiplicity-free spaces and prove a main
        theorem (see Theorem 3.3) on embedding the associated graded algebra of a graded
        G-multiplicity-free space into the algebra R(G/UG ). The final subsection discusses
        the rudiments of classical invariant theory, formulated in terms of the theory of dual
        pairs.
    §4: Section 4 begins with the simplest example of a pair of branching algebras for GLn ,
        leading us to the concept of reciprocity algebras. This is where we bring forth the
        classification of classical symmetric pairs and the theory of dual pairs to introduce
        the 5 pairs (also called see-saw pairs) of reciprocity algebras.
   For the second part of the paper, we organize discussions of the see-saw pairs as follows:
                                                4
    §5: discusses the branching from GLn to On (note that branching from GL2n to Sp2n can
         be treated similarly);
    §6: discusses the tensor product algebra for On (note that the tensor product algebra of
         Sp2n can be treated similarly);
    §7: provides a more general treatment of the reciprocity for (GLn , GLm ).
For the sake of brevity, we will not discuss the branching from Sp2(m+n) to Sp2m × Sp2n , O2n
to GLn and Sp2n to GLn . They can be treated similarly.
   In the final part of this paper we begin with some important comments on stability results
for branching in §8. We demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings for stability results,
highlighting certain specific see-saw pairs:
    §9: we interpret the associated graded of the branching algebra from GLn to On as a
         (0, 1)-subalgebra (see Definition 3.1) of the tensor product algebra of GLm in the
         stable range n > 2m.
   §10: we interpret the associated graded of the On tensor product algebra as a (0, 1)-
         subalgebra of a triple product of tensor product algebras of GLn , GLm and GLℓ in
         the stable range n > 2(m + ℓ).
   §11: we interpret the branching algebra of On+m to On × Om as a (0, 1)-subalgebra of a
         triple tensor product algebra of GLℓ in the stable range min (n, m) > 2ℓ.
   In all these cases, we show that the branching algebras associated to symmetric pairs can
all be identified with suitable branching algebras associated to the general linear groups.
Thus, if we can have control of the solution in the general linear group case, we will have
some control of the other classical groups. And indeed, we do (see [17]). The other non-
trivial examples will be important extensions of this work, and we hope to see them in further
papers, for example, [15].

                                2. Branching Algebras
   For a reductive complex linear algebraic G, let UG be a maximal unipotent subgroup of
G. The group UG is determined up to conjugacy in G [5]. Let AG denote a maximal torus
which normalizes UG , so that BG = AG · UG is a Borel subgroup of G. Also let A    b+ be the
                                                                                    G
set of dominant characters of AG – the semigroup of highest weights of representations of
G. It is well-known [5] [14] and may be thought of as a geometric version of the theory of
the highest weight, that the space of regular functions on the coset space G/UG , denoted by
R(G/UG ), decomposes (under the action of G by left translations) as a direct sum of one
copy of each irreducible representation Vψ (with highest weight ψ) of G (see [64]):
                                                  M
                                    R(G/UG ) ≃        Vψ .                              (2.1)

                                                b+ -graded algebra, for which the Vψ are the
  We note that R(G/UG ) has the structure of an AG
graded components. To be specific, we note that since AG normalizes UG , it acts on G/UG
by right translations, and this action commutes with the action of G by left translations.

The following result is well-known, probably folklore. We provide the proof anyway, since
we are not able to find a suitable reference.
Proposition 2.1. The algebra of regular functions R(G/UG ) is an A     b+ -graded algebra, under
                                                                        G
the right action of AG . More precisely, the decomposition (2.1) is the graded algebra decompo-
sition under AG , where Vψ is the AG -eigenspace corresponding to φ ∈ A   b+ with φ = w ∗ (ψ −1 ).
                                                                            G
Here w is the longest element of the Weyl group with respect to the root system determined
by the Borel subgroup BG .
Proof. Since AG is commutative and reductive, we can decompose R(G/UG ) into eigenspaces
for the right action of AG . These eigenspaces must be invariant under the action of G
by left translations. Since Vψ is irreducible for the action of G, it must belong to a sin-
gle AG eigenspace. Let f be the highest weight vector for BG in Vψ . Then by definition
La (f ) = ψ(a)(f ), where a ∈ AG and Lg indicates left translation by g: Lg (f )(h) = f (g −1h)
for any h in G, representing a point in G/UG . If w is the longest element of the Weyl group,
then the BG orbit BG wUG is dense in G/UG , so that f is determined by its restriction to
BG wUG . We compute that
            ψ(a)f (w) = La (f )(w) = f (a−1 w) = f (ww −1a−1 w) = Rw−1 a−1 w f (w),
where Rg f (h) = f (hg) refers to the right translation of f by g. If Vψ belongs to the φ
eigenspace for the right action of AG , then this equation implies that
                      ψ(a) = φ(w −1 a−1 w),           or     ψ = w ∗ (φ−1 ),                (2.2)
where w ∗ indicates the action of w on A  bG resulting from conjugation of AG by w. Thus,
the Vψ are exactly the eigenspaces for the right action of AG , with the AG -eigencharacter
related to the highest weight by the equation (2.2). Since the right action by AG (as well as
the left action by G) is an action by algebra automorphisms of R(G/UG ), it is easy to check
that if f1 is a φ-eigenfunction for AG , and f2 is a θ-eigenfunction, then the product f1 f2 is
a φθ-eigenfunction for AG . It follows that
                                          Vψ Vχ = Vψχ ,
                                                                   b+ -graded algebra on
so that, indeed, the decomposition (2.1) defines a structure of an AG
R(G/UG ).          
   Now let H ⊂ G be a reductive subgroup, and let UH be a maximal unipotent subgroup
of H. We consider the algebra R(G/UG )UH , of functions on G/UG which are invariant
under left translations by UH . Let AH be a maximal torus of H normalizing UH , so that
BH := AH · UH is a Borel subgroup of H. Then R(G/UG )UH will be invariant under the
(left) action of AH , and we may decompose R(G/UG )UH into eigenspaces for AH . Since
the functions in R(G/UG )UH are by definition (left) invariant under UH , the (left) AH -
eigenfunctions will in fact be (left) BH eigenfunctions. In other words, they are highest
weight vectors for H. Hence, the characters of AH acting on (the left of) R(G/UG )UH will
all be dominant with respect to BH , and we may write R(G/UG )UH as a sum of (left) AH
eigenspaces (R(G/UG )UH )χ for dominant characters χ of H:
                                            M
                            R(G/UG )UH =        (R(G/UG )UH )χ .                    (2.3)
                                                b+
                                              χ∈A H
                                                6
   Since the spaces Vψ of decomposition (2.1) are (left) G-invariant, they are a fortiori
left H-invariant, so we have a decomposition of R(G/UG )UH into right AG -eigenspaces
(R(G/UG )UH )ψ :
                              M                         M
                 R(G/UG )UH =     R(G/UG )UH ∩ Vψ :=        R(G/UG )UψH .
                                   b+
                                 ψ∈A                          b+
                                                            ψ∈A
                                     G                          G

Combining this decomposition with the decomposition (2.3), we may write
                                         M
                      R(G/UG )UH =             (R(G/UG )UψH )χ .                           (2.4)
                                            b+ , χ∈A
                                          ψ∈A      b+
                                              G      H

  To emphasize the key features of this algebra, we note the resulting consequences of
decomposition (2.4) in the following proposition.
Proposition 2.2.      (a) The decomposition (2.4) is an (Ab+ × A
                                                               b+ )-graded algebra decom-
                                                           G    H
      position of R(G/UG )UH .
  (b) The subspaces (R(G/UG )UψH )χ tell us the χ highest weight vectors for BH in the
      irreducible representation Vψ of G. Therefore, the decomposition
                                           M
                            R(G/UG )UψH =     (R(G/UG )UψH )χ
                                                b+
                                              χ∈A H

       tells us how Vψ decomposes as a H-module.
   Thus, knowledge of R(G/UG )UH as a (Ab+ × A
                                             b+ )-graded algebra tell us how representations
                                         G    H
of G decompose when restricted to H, in other words, it describes the branching rule from
G to H. We will call R(G/UG )UH the (G, H) branching algebra. When G ≃ H × H, and H
is embedded diagonally in G, the branching algebra describes the decomposition of tensor
products of representations of H, and we then call it the tensor product algebra for H. More
generally, we would like to understand the (G, H) branching algebras for symmetric pairs
(G, H).

                            3. Preliminaries and Notations
3.1. Parametrization of Representations. Let G be a classical reductive algebraic group
over C: G = GLn (C) = GLn , the general linear group; or G = On (C) = On , the orthogonal
group; or G = Sp2n (C) = Sp2n , the symplectic group. We shall explain our notations
on irreducible representations of G using integer partitions. In each of these cases, we
select a Borel subalgebra of the classical Lie algebra and coordinatize it, as is done in [10].
Consequently, all highest weights are parameterized in the standard way (see [10]).
   A non-negative integer partition λ, with k parts, is an integer sequence λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥
λk > 0. We may sometimes refer to λ as a Young or Ferrers diagram. We use the same
notation for partitions as is done in [52]. For example, we write ℓ(λ) to denote
                                                                               P the length (or
depth) of a partition, i.e., ℓ(λ) = k for the above partition. Also let |λ| = i λi be the size
of a partition and λ′ denote the transpose (or conjugate) of λ (i.e., (λ′ )i = |{λj : λj ≥ i}|).

GLn Representations: Given non-negative integers p, q and n such that n ≥ p + q and
                                                                                 (λ+ ,λ− )
non-negative integer partitions λ+ and λ− with p and q parts respectively, let F(n)        denote
                                                7
the irreducible rational representation of GLn with highest weight given by the n-tuple:
                                                                                           
                   (λ+ , λ− ) = λ+       +             +                  −
                                    1 , λ2 , · · · , λp , 0, · · · , 0, −λq , · · · , −λ1
                                                                                         −
                                 |                            {z                           }
                                                               n
                                                                                                     ∗
    −                               λ+            (λ+ ,λ− )                         +              λ−
If λ = (0) then we will write F(n) for F(n)                 . Note that if λ = (0) then F(n)             is
                  +  −
                                            + − ∗                                      −   +
                (λ ,λ )                          (λ ,λ )                               (λ ,λ )
equivalent to F(n)      . More generally, F(n)                is equivalent to F(n)            .

On Representations: The complex orthogonal group has two connected components. Be-
cause the group is disconnected we cannot index irreducible representations by highest
weights. There is however an analog of Schur-Weyl duality for the case of On in which
each irreducible rational representation is indexed uniquely by a non-negative integer parti-
tion ν such that (ν ′ )1 + (ν ′ )2 ≤ n. That is, the sum of the first two columns of the Young
diagram of ν is at most n. We will call such a diagram On -admissible (see [10] Chapter 10
                      ν
for details). Let E(n)  denote the irreducible representation of On indexed ν in this way.
   An irreducible rational representation of SOn may be indexed by its highest weight. In
[10] Section 5.2.2, the irreducible representations of On are determined in terms of their
restrictions to SOn (which is a normal subgroup having index 2). We note that if ℓ(ν) 6= n2 ,
                           ν
then the restriction of E(n)  to SOn is irreducible. If ℓ(ν) = n2 (n even), then E(n)  ν
                                                                                         decomposes
into exactly two irreducible representations of SOn . See [10] Section 10.2.4 and 10.2.5 for the
correspondence between this parametrization and the above parametrization by partitions.
   The determinant defines an (irreducible) one-dimensional representation of On . This repre-
sentation is indexed by the length n partition ζ = (1, 1, · · · , 1). An irreducible representation
                                                          ζ
of On will remain irreducible when tensored by E(n)          , but the resulting representation may
be inequivalent to the initial representation. We say that a pair of On -admissible partitions
                             α        ζ ∼      β
α and β are associate if E(n)     ⊗ E(n) = E(n) . It turns out that α and β are associate exactly
when (α′ )1 + (β ′ )1 = n and (α′)i = (β ′ )i for all i > 1. This relation is clearly symmetric, and
is related to the structure of the underlying SOn -representations. Indeed, when restricted
           α ∼       β
to SOn , E(n)  = E(n) if and only if α and β are either associate or equal.

Sp2n Representations: For a non-negative integer partition ν with p parts where p ≤ n, let
  ν
V(2n) denote the irreducible rational representation of Sp2n where the highest weight indexed
by the partition ν is given by the n tuple:
                                       (ν1 , ν2 , · · · , νp , 0, · · · , 0)
                                       |                {z                 }.
                                                         n

3.2. Multiplicity-Free Actions. Let G be a complex reductive algebraic group acting on
a complex vector space V . We say V is a multiplicity-free action if the algebra P(V ) of
polynomial functions on V is multiplicity free as a G module. The criterion of Servedio-
Vinberg [60] [65] says that V is multiplicity free if and only if a Borel subgroup B of G has a
Zariski open orbit in V . In other words, B (and hence G) acts prehomogeneously on V (see
[59]). A direct consequence is that B eigenfunctions in P(V ) have a very simple structure.
Let Qψ ∈ P(V ) be a B eigenfunction with eigencharacter ψ, normalized so that Qψ (v0 ) = 1
for some fixed v0 in a Zariski open B orbit in V . Then Qψ is completely determined by ψ:
                                                        8
For v = b−1 v0 in the Zariski open B orbit,
                    Qψ (v) = Qψ (b−1 v0 ) = ψ(b)Qψ (v0 ) = ψ(b),     b ∈ B.
Qψ is then determined on all of V by continuity. Since B = AU, and U = (B, B) is the
commutator subgroup of B, we can identify a character of B with a character of A. Thus
the B eigenfunctions are precisely the G highest weight vectors (with respect to B) in P(V ).
Further
                                      Qψ1 Qψ2 = Qψ1 ψ2
and so the set of A b+ (V ) = {ψ ∈ Ab+ | Qψ 6= 0} forms a sub-semigroup of the cone A  b+ of
dominant weights of A.
   An element ψ(6= 1) of a semigroup is primitive if it is not expressible as a non-trivial
product of two elements of the semigroup. The algebra P(V )U has unique factorization
(see [18]). The eigenfunctions associated to the primitive elements of A   b+ (V ) are prime
polynomials, and P(V )U is the polynomial ring on these eigenfunctions. If ψ = ψ1 ψ2 , then
Qψ = Qψ1 Qψ2 . Thus, if ψ is not primitive, then the polynomial Qψ cannot be prime. An
element
                                                    c
                                         ψ = Πkj=1 ψj j
has cj ’s uniquely determined, and hence the prime factorization
                                                      c
                                       Qψ = Πkj=1 Qψjj .
   Consider a multiplicity-free action of G on an algebra W. In the general situation, we
would like to associate this algebra W with a subalgebra of R(G/U). With this goal in
mind, we introduce the following notion:
                           L
Definition 3.1. Let P = λ∈Ab+ Pλ denote an algebra graded by an abelian semigroup A   b+ .
If W ⊆ P is a subalgebra of P, then we say that W is a (0, 1)-subalgebra of P if
                                             M
                                         W=      Pλ
                                               λ∈Z

                              b+ , which we will denote by A
where Z is a sub-semigroup of A                            b+ (W) = Z. Note that W is
          b+ (W).
graded by A
  In what is to follow, we will usually have P = P(V ) (polynomial functions on a vector
space V ) and Ab+ will denote the dominant chamber of the character group of a maximal
torus A of a reductive group G acting on V . In this situation, we introduce an A+ -filtration
on W as follows:                              M
                                      W (ψ) =     Wφ
                                                φ≤ψ

                                        b+ given by (see [55])
where the ordering ≤ is the ordering on A
                     ψ1 ≤ ψ2      if ψ1−1 ψ2 is expressible as a product of
                                   rational powers of positive roots.
Note that positive roots are weights of the adjoint representation of G on its Lie algebra g.
We refer to the abelian group structure on the integral weights multiplicatively. Also, it will
turn out that we only need positive integer powers of the positive roots.
                                               9
   Next consider the more specific situation where W which is a G-invariant and G-multiplicity-
free subalgebra of a polynomial algebra P(V ). Suppose that W U has unique factorization.
Then W U is a polynomial ring and A     b+ (W) is a free sub-semigroup in A  b+ generated by
the highest weights corresponding to the non-zero graded components of W. Write the G
decomposition as follows:                      M
                                       W=           Wψ
                                              b+ (W)
                                            ψ∈A

noting that Wψ is an irreducible G module with highest weight ψ.
  If δ occurs with positive multiplicity in the tensor product decomposition
                                   M
                      Wφ ⊗ Wψ =         dim HomG (Wδ , Wφ ⊗ Wψ ) Wδ ,
                                      δ

then δ ≤ φψ. If
                  Wη ⊂ W (φ)   and Wγ ⊂ W (ψ) ,        i.e., η ≤ φ and γ ≤ ψ,
then it follows that
                          Wη · Wγ ֒→ Wη ⊗ Wγ ⊂ W (ηγ) ⊂ W (φψ) .
Thus
                                  W (φ) · W (ψ) ⊂ W (φψ) .
We have now an A+ -filtered algebra
                                            [
                                    W=            W (ψ) ,
                                             b+ (W)
                                           ψ∈A

and this filtration is known as the dominance filtration [55].
                                                                       b+ graded:
  With a filtered algebra, we can form its associated algebra which is A
                                            M
                                GrAb+ W =          (GrAb+ W)ψ
                                              b+ (W)
                                            ψ∈A

where                                                                !
                                                       M
                               (GrAb+ W)ψ = W (ψ) /          W (φ)       .

Theorem 3.2. Consider a multiplicity-free G-module W with a A b+ -filtered algebra structure
such that W is a unique factorization domain. Assume that the zero degree subspace of W
                                b+ -graded algebra injection:
is C. Then there is a canonical A
                                GrAb+ π : GrAb+ W ֒→ R(G/U).
Proof. In [14] it is shown that under the above hypothesis, W U is a polynomial ring on
                                             b+ -graded algebra and therefore, there exists
a canonical set of generators. Now, W U is a A
             b+ -graded algebra homomorphism obtained by sending each generator of the
an injective A
domain to a (indeed any) highest weight vector of the same weight in the codomain:
                                    α : W U ֒→ R(G/U)U .
Note that W U = GrAb+ (W U ) = (GrAb+ W)U .
                                               10
   There exists a unique G-module homomorphism α : GrAb+ W ֒→ R(G/U) such that the
following diagram commutes:
                             α:            WU            ֒→        R(G/U)U
                                           ∩                          ∩
                             α:       GrAb+ W            ֒→        R(G/U)
  We wish to show that α is an algebra homomorphism, i.e.,

                                                              −→
                      (GrAb+ W)λ × (GrAb+ W)µ                 mW
                                                                    (GrAb+ W)λ+µ

                          α↓                 α↓                         α↓
                                                           −→
                       R(G/U)λ       ×    R(G/U)µ        mR(G/U )
                                                                     R(G/U)λ+µ
commutes.
  We have two maps:
                   fi : (GrAb+ W)λ ⊗ (GrAb+ W)µ → R(G/U)λ+µ ,                i = 1, 2,
defined by: f1 (v ⊗ w) = mR(G/U ) (α(v) ⊗ α(w)) and f2 (v ⊗ w) = α(mW (v ⊗ w)).
  Each of f1 and f2 is G-equivariant and,
                                                                  	
                  dim β  β : (Gr b+ W)λ ⊗ (Gr b+ W)µ → R(G/U)λ+µ = 1
                                     A               A
because the Cartan product has multiplicity one in the tensor product of two irreducible
G-modules Vλ and Vµ [55].
  Therefore, there exists a constant C such that f1 = Cf2 . We know that α|W U = α is an
algebra homomorphism. So for highest weight vectors v λ ∈ WλU and w µ ∈ WµU :
      f1 (v λ ⊗ w µ ) = α(v λ)α(w µ ) = α(v λ )α(w µ) = α(v λw µ ) = α(v λ w µ ) = f2 (v λ ⊗ w µ ).
(Note that v λ w µ is a highest weight vector.) Note that C = 1.              
3.3. Dual Pairs and Duality Correspondence. We recall here some material and nota-
tion that will be required for later sections. Much of this material can be found in several
other sources on classical invariant theory (such as [14] and [10]).
   In our context, the theory of dual pairs may be cast in a purely algebraic language. In
this section, we will describe three dual pairs (K, g), where K is a classical linear algebraic
group defined over C and g is a complex classical Lie algebra. In each case, we have a linear
action of K on a finite dimensional complex vector space V , which is a finite sum of copies
of the standard module for K or copies of the dual of the standard module for K. This
action induces an action on the complex valued polynomial functions on V , upon which
g acts by polynomial coefficient differential operators. The actions of g and K commute
with each other. Furthermore, the algebra of polynomial coefficient differential operators
which commute with the K-action (resp. g-action) on P(V ) is generated as an algebra
by the image of the g-action (resp. K-action). In light of this situation, we may regard
P(V ) as a representation of g and K simultaneously. Theorem 3.4 describes, in part, the
(multiplicity-free) decomposition of P(V ) into irreducible modules for the joint action.
   Of particular importance are the K-invariants in P(V ). In each case, we may describe this
invariant ring through the action of g. Indeed, g may be decomposed into three subspaces
                                                   11
denoted g(2,0) , g(1,1) and g(0,2) . These subspaces are in fact Lie subalgebras with g(0,2) and
g(2,0) abelian, while g(1,1) normalizes each of them. Furthermore, g(1,1) ⊕g(2,0) and g(1,1) ⊕g(0,2)
are the Levi decompositions of certain parabolic subalgebras of g.
   Theorem 3.3 asserts that P(V )K is generated as an algebra by g(2,0) . Moreover, within a
certain stable range (described in Theorem 3.3), P(V )K is isomorphic to S(g(2,0) ), the full
symmetric algebra on g(2,0) . This is the first fundamental theorems of classical invariant
theory (see [10], [14], [66]).
   Note that at the same time, we obtain an action of K (by conjugation) on the constant co-
efficient differential operators on P(V ), denoted D(V ). In turn, the K-invariant subalgebra,
D(V )K is generated by g(0,2) . This brings us to our next ingredient. Define the K-harmonic
polynomials to be:
                                                                       	
                         H := f ∈ P(V ) | ∆f = 0 for all ∆ ∈ D(V )K .
                                                             m
For each dual pair, we have a surjection, P(V )K ⊗ H → P(V ) defined by multiplication.
Note that we may regard P(V ) as a module over the algebra P(V )K . By definition, this
module is free iff m is injective. Within a certain stable range, m is indeed injective, and
this range is indicated as part of Theorem 3.3. We have provided a proof of the injectivity
part of this theorem (also known as the Separation of Variables Theorem) as an appendix
of this paper.
   For each (g, K), the subspace g(1,1) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a subgroup G(1,1) ⊆
GL(V ) which commutes with the action of K. In Theorem 3.5 we describe the action of this
group. Note that, in general, the differential of the action of G(1,1) on P(V ) is not quite the
same as the action of g(1,1) ; however, it differs only by a central shift.
   Under the joint action of K × G(1,1) , H is a multiplicity-free invariant subspace of P(V ).
The precise decomposition of H is provided in Theorem 3.5.
   Finally, in each of the three dual pair settings we have P(V ) = I(J + ) ⊕ H, where I(J + )
is the ideal in P(V ) generated by g(2,0) (which is the same as the ideal generated by the
homogeneous invariants of positive degree). We note that the natural map:
                                       H −→ P(V )/I(J + )                                     (3.1)
is a linear isomorphism of representations.
   Details in this section including all theorems stated can be found in [10], [12] or [14].
3.3.1. Definitions of the Three Dual Pair Actions. We now describe the three dual pairs in
detail as well as state Theorems 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 on a case-by-case basis. For the following,
we let Mn,m be the complex vector space of n by m matrices. We shall select a coordinate
system {xij |i = 1, · · · , n, j = 1, · · · , m}.

CASE A: (On , sp2m ) where V := Mn,m .
By On we mean the group of invertible n × n matrices,       g such that gJg t = J where J is the
n × n matrix:                                              
                                       0 ··· 0 1
                                    ..                     
                                    . ··· 1 0              
                              J =                          .
                                    0 1 · · · ...          
                                       1 0 ··· 0
                                                 12
This group acts on the complex n × m matrices, V = Mn,m by left multiplication.
  Using the standard matrices entries as coordinates, we define the following differential
operators:
           P            2                P                              P
    ∆ij := ns=1 ∂xsi ∂x∂n−s+1 j , rij2 := ns=1 xsi xn−s+1 j , and Eij := ns=1 xsi ∂xn−s+1j
                                                                                     ∂
                                                                                           .

We define three spaces:
                                  (1,1)                                             	
                                sp2m := Span      Eij + n2 δi,j | i, j = 1, . . . , m ,
                                  (2,0)                                 	
                                sp2m      := Span rij2 | 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m , and
                                  (0,2)
                                sp2m := Span {∆ij | 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m} .
                                   (2,0)       (1,1)           (0,2)
  The direct sum, g := sp2m ⊕ sp2m ⊕ sp2m , is preserved under the usual operator bracket
and is isomorphic, as a Lie algebra, to the rank m complex symplectic Lie algebra, sp2m . This
presentation defines an action of sp2m on P(Mn,m ). The On action is defined by multiplication
on the left: for g ∈ On and f ∈ P(Mn,m ) we set g · f (x) = f (g t x) for all x ∈ Mn,m .

CASE B: (Sp2n , so2m ) where V = M2n,m .
By Sp2n wemean the group
                             of complex 2n × 2n invertible matrices, g, such that gJg t = J
               0 Ik
where J =                 with Ik the k × k identity matrix. This group acts on the complex
             −Ik 0
2n × m matrices, V = M2n,m by left multiplication.
  Using the standard matrix entries as coordinates, we define the following differential op-
erators:
          P         ∂2              ∂2
                                                             Pn
    Dij := ns=1 ∂xsi ∂x s+n,j
                              − ∂x s+n,i ∂x sj
                                                 ,    S 2
                                                        ij :=  s=1 (xsi xs+n,j − xs+n,i xsj ), and
                                                  P2n
                                       Eij := s=1 xsi ∂x∂sj .

We define three spaces:
                                 (1,1)
                            so2m := Span {Eij + n δi,j | i, j = 1, . . . , m} ,
                              (2,0)                            	
                            so2m := Span Sij2 | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m ,             and
                                 (0,2)
                            so2m := Span {Dij | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m} .
                                   (2,0)       (1,1)           (0,2)
  The direct sum, g := so2m ⊕ so2m ⊕ so2m , is isomorphic to so2m , the rank m orthogonal
Lie algebra of type D, and this presentation defines an action of so2m on P(M2n,m ). For
g ∈ Sp2n and f ∈ P(M2n,m ), we set g · f (x) = f (g tx) for all x ∈ M2n,m .

CASE C: (GLn , glm+ℓ ) where V = Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n .
Let {xab } and {ycd } be the coordinates on Mn,m and Mℓ,n respectively. Define the following
differential operators:
            n
            X                                n

                                                                                                             X

   ∆ij :=                   ,     r 2ij :=         xsi yjs ,     X

(In the above, i and j range over the appropriate interval defined by the sizes of the matrices.)
We define three spaces:
      (1,1)                                             	     

  The direct sum, g := glm,ℓ ⊕ glm,ℓ ⊕ glm,ℓ , is isomorphic to the rank m + ℓ general linear
Lie algebra glm+ℓ , and this presentation defines an action of glm+ℓ on P(Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n ). For
g ∈ GLn and f ∈ P(Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n ), we set g · f (x, y) = f (g t x, y(g t)−1 ) for all x ∈ Mn,m ,
y ∈ Mℓ,n .
3.3.2. Theorems on the Invariants, Decompositions and Harmonics. Let SMm and AMm be
the space of symmetric and anti-symmetric m by m matrices respectively. If V is a vector
space, we denote the symmetric algebra on V by S(V ). Note that in each of the dual pairs,
we have defined the action of K on P(V ) so that P(V ) ∼= S(V ) as K modules. (This is in
                                             ∼    ∗
contrast with the usual identification P(V ) = S(V ).) Also, for a set S, we shall denote by
C[S] by the algebra generated by elements in the set S.

Theorem.
  The Lie algebra g acts on P(V ) via differential operators. Under this action P(V ) decom-
poses into irreducible (infinite-dimensional, highest weight) representations of g. The group
                                                     14
K is reductive, so P(V ) also decomposes into irreducible (finite-dimensional, highest weight)
representations of K.
   In the space of polynomial coefficient differential operators, the algebra generated by the
image of the K-action is a the full centralizer of the algebra generated by the g-action. A
consequence of this is that P(V ) has a multiplicity free decomposition under the joint action
of the group K and the Lie algebra g. The irreducible constituents are of the form U ⊗ U     e
where U is an irreducible K-representation while U   e is an irreducible g-representation.
   In each of the three cases, On , Sp2n and GLn , denote the representations paired with E λ ,
V λ and F λ by E eλ , Ve λ and Feλ respectively. The parametrization involving highest weights
being made precise by the pairing defined in the following theorem:

       The group Sp2n × GLm acts on P(M2n,m ) by (g, h) · f (x) = f (g t xh), where g ∈
       Sp2n , h ∈ GLm and x ∈ M2n,m . Then H2n,m is invariant under this action. As a

                                   4. Reciprocity Algebras
   In this paper, we study branching algebras using classical invariant theory. The formula-
tion of classical invariant theory in terms of dual pairs [12] allows one to realize branching
algebras for classical symmetric pairs as concrete algebras of polynomials on vector spaces.
Furthermore, when realized in this way, the branching algebras have a double interpretation
in which they solve two related branching problems simultaneously. Classical invariant the-
ory also provides a flexible means which allows an inductive approach to the computation
of branching algebras, and makes evident natural connections between different branching
algebras.
   The easiest illustration of the above assertions is the realization of the tensor product
algebra for GLn presented as follows.

4.1. Illustration: Tensor Product Algebra for GLn . This first example is in [14], which
we recall here as it is a model for the other (more involved) constructions of branching
algebras as total subalgebras of GLn tensor product algebras.
  Consider the joint action of GLn × GLm on the P(Mn,m ) by the rule
               (g, h) · f (x) = f (g t xh),   for g ∈ GLn , h ∈ GLm , x ∈ Mn,m .
For the corresponding action on polynomials, one has the decomposition (see Theorem 3.4(c)
and (3.8))
                                           M

of the polynomials into irreducible GLn × GLm representations. Note that the sum is over
non-negative partitions λ with length at most min (n, m).
   Let Um = UGLm denote the upper triangular unipotent subgroup of GLm . From decom-
position (4.1), we can easily see that
                                                  !Um
                                  M                     M

                                           ⊗ F(m)     ≃     λ
                                                          F(n)      λ
                                                               ⊗ (F(m) )U m .      (4.2)

                    λ
Since the spaces (F(m) )Um are one-dimensional, the sum in equation (4.2) consists of one
                                                                               b+ , where Am
copy of each F λ . Just as in the discussion of §3.2, the algebra is graded by A
               (n)                                                                 m
is the diagonal torus of GLm , and one sees from (4.2) that the graded components are the
  λ
F(n) .
   By the arguments in §3.2, P(Mn,m )Um can thus be associated to a graded subalgebra in
R(GLn /Un ), in particular, this is a (0, 1)-subalgebra as in Definition 3.1. To study tensor
products of representations of GLn , we can take the direct sum of Mn,m and Mn,ℓ . We
then have an action of GLn × GLm × GLℓ on P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ ). Since P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ ) ≃
P(Mn,m ) ⊗ P (Mn,ℓ ), we may deduce from (4.1) that
                      P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ )Um ×Uℓ ≃ P(Mn,m )Um ⊗ P(Mn,ℓ )Uℓ
                          M µ                                    

                        ≃    (F(n) ⊗ F(n) ) ⊗ (F(m) )Um ⊗ (F(ℓ)
                                                             ν Uℓ
                                                                )   .                    (4.3)

                                                                        µ      ν
  Thus, this algebra is the sum of one copy of each tensor products F(n)   ⊗ F(n) . Hence, if
we take the Un -invariants, we will get a subalgebra of the tensor product algebra for GLn .
This results in the algebra
                   (P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ )Um ×Uℓ )Un ≃ P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ )Um ×Uℓ ×Un .
  This shows that we can realize the tensor product algebra for GLn , or more precisely,
various (0, 1)-subalgebras of it, as algebras of polynomial functions on matrices, specifically
as the algebras P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ )Um ×Uℓ ×Un .
  However, the algebra P(Mn,m ⊕ Mn,ℓ )Um ×Uℓ ×Un has a second interpretation, as a different
branching algebra. We note that Mn,m ⊕Mn,ℓ ≃ Mn,m+ℓ . On this space we have the action of
GLn × GLm+ℓ , which is described by the obvious adaptation of equation (4.1). The action of
GLn × GLm × GLℓ arises by restriction of the action of GLm+ℓ to the subgroup GLm × GLℓ
embedded block diagonally in GLm+ℓ . By (the obvious analog of) decomposition (4.2), we

This algebra embeds as a subalgebra of R(GLm+ℓ /Um+ℓ ), in particular, this is a (0, 1)-
subalgebra as in Definition 3.1. If we then take the Um × Uℓ invariants, we find that
                                             M
                   (P(Mn,m+ℓ )Un )Um ×Uℓ ≃         λ Un

                                              λ

is (a (0, 1)-subalgebra of) the (GLm+ℓ , GLm × GLℓ ) branching algebra. Thus, we have es-
tablished the following result.
Theorem 4.1.       (a) The algebra P(Mn,m+ℓ )Un ×Um ×Uℓ is isomorphic to a (0, 1)-subalgebra
      of the (GLn × GLn , GLn ) branching algebra (a.k.a. the GLn tensor product algebra),
      and to a (0, 1)-subalgebra of the (GLm+ℓ , GLm × GLℓ ) branching algebra.
  (b) In particular, the dimension of the ψ λ × ψ µ × ψ ν homogeneous component for An ×
      Am × Aℓ of P(Mn,m+ℓ )Un ×Um ×Uℓ records simultaneously
                                  λ                          µ      ν
        (i) the multiplicity of F(n) in the tensor product F(n) ⊗ F(n) , and
                                  µ       ν      λ
       (ii) the multiplicity of F(m) ⊗ F(ℓ) in F(m+ℓ) ,
      for partitions µ, ν, λ such that ℓ(µ) ≤ min(n, m), ℓ(ν) ≤ min(n, ℓ) and ℓ(λ) ≤
      min(n, m + ℓ).
   Thus, we can not only realize the GLn tensor product algebra concretely as an algebra
of polynomials, we find that it appears simultaneously in two guises, the second being as
the branching algebra for the pair (GLm+ℓ , GLm × GLℓ ). We emphasize two features of this
situation.
   First, the pair (GLm+ℓ , GLm ×GLℓ ), as well as the pair (GLn ×GLn , GLn ), is a symmetric
pair. Hence, both the interpretations of P(Mn,m+ℓ )Un ×Um ×Uℓ are as branching algebras for
symmetric pairs.
   Second, the relationship between the two situations is captured by the notion of “see-saw
pair” of dual pairs [41]. Precisely, a context for understanding the decomposition law (4.1)
is provided by observing that GLn and GLm (or more correctly, slight modifications of their
Lie algebras) are mutual centralizers inside the Lie algebra sp(Mn,m ) (of the metaplectic
group) of polynomial coefficient differential operators of total degree two on Mn,m [12] [14].
We say that they define a dual pair inside sp(Mn,m ). The decomposition (4.1) then appears
                                              18
as the correspondence of representations associated to this dual pair [12]. Further, the pairs
of groups (GLn , GLm+ℓ ) = (G1 , G′1 ) and (GLn × GLn , GLm × GLℓ ) = (G2 , G′2 ) both define
dual pairs inside the Lie algebra sp(Mn,m+ℓ ). We evidently have the relations
                               G1 = GLn ⊂ GLn × GLn = G2 ,                                 (4.4)
and (hence)
                              G′1 = GLm+ℓ ⊃ GLm × GLℓ = G′2 .                               (4.5)
We refer to a pair of dual pairs related as in inclusions (4.4) and (4.5), a see-saw pair of dual
pairs.
   In these terms, we may think of the symmetric pairs (G2 , G1 ) and (G′1 , G′2 ) as a “recip-
rocal pair” of symmetric pairs. If we do so, we see that the algebra P(Mn,m+ℓ )Un ×Um ×Uℓ is
                           U ×U ′
describable as P(Mn,m+ℓ ) G1 G2 – it has a description in terms of the see-saw pair, and in
this description the two pairs of the see-saw, or alternatively, the two reciprocal symmetric
pairs, enter equivalently into the description of the algebra that describes the branching law
for both symmetric pairs. For this reason, we also call this algebra, which describes the
branching law for both symmetric pairs, the reciprocity algebra of the pair of pairs.
   It turns out that any branching algebra associated to a classical symmetric pair, that is, a
pair (G, H) in which G is a product of classical groups, has an interpretation as a reciprocity
algebra – an algebra that describes a branching law for two reciprocal symmetric pairs
simultaneously. Sometimes, however, one of the branching laws involves infinite-dimensional
representations.
4.2. Symmetric Pairs and Reciprocity Pairs. In the context of dual pairs, we would like
to understand the (G, H) branching of irreducible representations of G to H, for symmetric
pairs (G, H). Table I lists the symmetric pairs which we will cover in this paper.
   If G is a classical group over C, then G can be embedded as one member of a dual pair in
the symplectic group as described in [12]. The resulting pairs of groups are (GLn , GLm ) or
(On , Sp2m ), each inside Sp2nm , and are called irreducible dual pairs. In general, a dual pair
of reductive groups in Sp2r is a product of such pairs.

Proposition 4.2 Let G be a classical group, or a product of two copies of a classical group.
Let G belong to a dual pair (G, G′ ) in a symplectic group Sp2m . Let H ⊂ G be a symmetric
subgroup, and let H ′ be the centralizer of H in Sp2m . Then (H, H ′ ) is also a dual pair in
Sp2m , and G′ is a symmetric subgroup inside H ′ .
Proof: This can be shown by fairly easy case-by-case checking. The basic reason that
(H, H ′ ) form a dual pair is that, for any classical symmetric pair (G, H), the restriction of
the standard module of G, or its dual, to H is a sum of standard modules of H, or their
duals [12]. This is very easy to check on a case-by-case basis. The see-saw relationship of
symmetric pairs organizes the 10 series of symmetric pairs as given in Table I into five pairs
of pairs. These are shown in Table II.        

Remark: Note that when the second component of any pair in Table II is of Lie type A,
then the action actually integrates to the group. Table II also amounts to another point of
view on the structure on which [13] is based.
   We begin with discussions of reciprocity algebras in the next three sections. The discus-
sions provided are ordered more in terms of complexity and do not follow the sequence given
in Table I.

                             5. Branching from GLn to On
  Consider the problem of restricting irreducible representations of GLn to the orthogonal
group On . We consider the symmetric see-saw pair (GLn , On ) and (Sp2m , GLm ). As in
the discussion of §4.1, we can realize (a (0, 1)-subalgebra of) the coordinate ring of the flag
manifold GLn /Un as the algebra of Um -invariants on P(Mn,m ). If we then look at the UOn -
invariants in this algebra, then we will have (a certain (0, 1)-subalgebra of) the (GLn , On )
branching algebra. Thus, we are interested in the algebra
                                       P(Mn,m )UOn ×Um .
We note that, in analogy with the situation of §4.1, this is the algebra of invariants for the
unipotent subgroups of the smaller member of each symmetric pair.
  Let us investigate what this algebra appears to be if we first take invariants with respect
to UOn . We have a decomposition of P(Mn,m ) as a joint On × sp2m -module (see Theorem
3.4 (a)):
                                          M µ
                               P(Mn,m ) ≃      E ⊗E    eµ .                              (5.1)
                                                     (n)   (2m)
                                                µ

Recall that the sum runs through the set of all non-negative integer partitions µ such that
                                                µ
ℓ(µ) ≤ min(n, m) and (µ′ )1 + (µ′ )2 ≤ n. Here E(n) denotes the irreducible On representation
                                                                        L µ          µ
parameterized by µ. Recall from §3.3, the decomposition P(Mn,m ) ≃ µ F(n)        ⊗ F(m) . The
module E µ is generated by the GLn highest weight vector in F µ . Further, E      eµ     is an
          (n)                                                       (n)                (2m)
                                                                                µ
irreducible infinite-dimensional representation of sp2m with lowest glm -type F(m) .
Theorem 5.1. Assume n > 2m.
  (a) The algebra P(Mn,m )UOn ×Um is isomorphic to a (0, 1)-subalgebra of the (GLn , On )
      branching algebra, and to a (0, 1)-subalgebra of the (sp2m , GLm ) branching algebra.
  (b) In particular, the dimension of the φµ × ψ λ homogeneous component for AOn × Am
      of P(Mn,m )UOn ×Um records simultaneously
                                  µ                          λ
        (i) the multiplicity of E(n) in the representation F(n) , and
       (ii) the multiplicity of F λ in E e µ
                                              .
                                 (m)     (2m)
       for partitions µ, λ such that ℓ(µ) ≤ m, ℓ(λ) ≤ m.
Proof. Taking the UOn -invariants for the decomposition (5.1), we find that
                                          M µ
                          P(Mn,m )UOn ≃                   eµ ,
                                             (E(n) )UOn ⊗ E                                   (5.2)
                                                           (2m)
                                                µ

where the sum is over partitions µ such that ℓ(µ) ≤ min(n, m) and (µ′ )1 +(µ′ )2 ≤ n. Note that
                                                                                  µ UO n
the stability condition n > 2m guarantees the latter inequality. The space (E(n)     )   is the
                                      µ UO n
space of highest weight vectors for (E(n) ) . We would like to say that it is one-dimensional,
                                                                                         eµ .
so that P(Mn,m )UOn would consist of one copy of each of the irreducible representations E    (2m)
But, owing to the disconnectedness of On , this is not quite true, and when it is true, the
                                               µ
highest weight may not completely determine E(n)  .
                               µ UO n                                            µ
  However, if n > 2m, then (E(n) )    is one-dimensional, and does single out E(n)  among
the representations which appear in the sum (5.1). Hence, let us make this restriction for
                                                21
the present discussion. Taking the Um invariants in the sum (5.2), we find that
                                          M µ
                       (P(Mn,m )UOn )Um ≃                  e µ )U m .
                                             (E(n) )UOn ⊗ (E                               (5.3)
                                                            (2m)
                                              µ

Note that the sum is over all partitions µ such that ℓ(µ) ≤ m (since n > 2m). The space
 e µ )Um describes how the representation E
(E                                           eµ of sp2m decomposes as a glm module, or
  (2m)                                        (2m)
                                                 eµ )Um describes the branching rule from
equivalently, as a GLm -module. In other words, (E (2m)
                           eµ .
sp2m to glm for the module E  (2m)
                                                                  µ UO n
  We know (thanks to our restriction to n > 2m) that the space (E(n) )   is one-dimensional.
      µ                         µ UO n          µ
Let φ be the AOn weight of (E(n) ) . Thus, φ is the restriction to the diagonal maximal
torus AOn of the character ψ µ of the group An of diagonal n × n matrices. Our assumption
                                       µ
further implies that φµ determines E(n)  . Therefore, for a given dominant Am weight ψ λ ,
corresponding to the partition λ, where ℓ(λ) ≤ m, the ψ λ -eigenspace in (E e µ )Um tells us
                                                                                (2m)
the multiplicity of  λ
                   F(m)                        e µ to glm . This is the same as the dimension
                         in the restriction of E(2m)
of the joint (φµ × ψ )-eigenspace in
                    λ


                  (P(Mn,m )UOn )Um ≃ P(Mn,m )UOn ×Um ≃ (P(Mn,m )Um )UOn .
                                                                                    µ       λ
  But we have already seen that this eigenspace describes the multiplicity of E(n)     in F(n) .
                                                                    UOn ×Um
Thus, again the AOn × Am homogeneous components of P(Mn,m )                 have a simultane-
ous interpretation, one for a branching law associated to each of the two symmetric pairs
composing the symmetric see-saw pair.              
  In this case, one of the branching laws involves infinite-dimensional representations. How-
ever, they are highest weight representations, which are the most tractable of infinite-
dimensional representations, from an algebraic point of view.

                          6. Tensor Product Algebra for On
                                                                              
   Using the symmetric see-saw pair (On , On × On ), (Sp2m × Sp2ℓ , Sp2(m+ℓ) ) , we can con-
struct ((0, 1)-subalgebras of) the tensor product algebra for On . To prepare for this, we
should explicate the decomposition (5.1) further.
   Let us recall the basic setup as in §3.3.1 Case A. Recall that Jn,m = P(Mn,m )On is the
algebra of On -invariant polynomials. Theorem 3.3(a) implies that Jn,m is a quotient of
     (2,0)                              (2,0)
S(sp2m ), the symmetric algebra on sp2m .
   The natural mapping
                                                       +
                                 Hn,m → P(Mn,m )/I(Jn,m   )                            (6.1)
is a linear On × GLm -module isomorphism. Further, the On × GLm structure of Hn,m is as
follows (see Theorem 3.5(a)):
                                        M µ         µ
                                Hn,m ≃     E(n) ⊗ F(m) .                          (6.2)
                                             µ

Here µ ranges over the same diagrams as in (5.1).
  From Theorem 3.4(a),
                            e µ ≃ F µ · Jn,m ≃ S(sp(2,0) ) · F µ ,
                            E                                                              (6.3)
                             (2m)  (m)             2m         (m)
                                                 22
and it follows that
                                  e µ /(sp(2,0) · E
                                  E               eµ ) ≃ F µ .
                                   (2m)   2m       (2m)   (m)
                                                                       e µ by the GLm
In other words, we can detect the sp2m isomorphism class of the module E(2m)
isomorphism class of the quotient E e µ /(sp(2,0) · E
                                                    eµ ). Also, if W ⊂ P(Mn,m ) is any
                                        (2m)    2m       (2m)
sp2m -invariant subspace, then
                                        (2,0)
                                  W/(sp2m · W ) ≃ W ∩ Hn,m ,
and this subspace also reveals the sp2m isomorphism type of W .
  We can use the above to find a model for (a (0, 1)-subalgebra of) the tensor product
algebra of On . One consequence of the above discussion is that
                                       +
                                            Um M µ           µ

  If we repeat the above discussion for Mn,ℓ , and combine the results, we find that

is a direct sum of one copy of each possible tensor product of an E(n)     with an E(n) . At this
point, we make the assumption that n > 2(m + ℓ), as in this range the On constituents of
decomposition are irreducible when restricted to the connected component of the identity in
On . If we now take the UOn -invariants in equation (6.5), we will have (a (0, 1)-subalgebra
of) the tensor product algebra of On :

  We can describe this algebra in another way. Begin with the observation that P(Mn,m ) ⊗
P(Mn,ℓ ) ≃ P(Mn,m+ℓ ), and
                         +                   +                     +      +

Proof. Let us now compute the ring expressed in this way. From Theorem 3.4(a), we know

Note that within the range n > 2(m+ℓ) we have           dim(E(n) )      = 1 since the On -representations

E(n) remain irreducible when restricted to SOn .

  From the discussion following equation (6.1), we see that the factor

  Hence, again the algebra has a double interpretation, one in terms of decomposing tensor
products of On representations, and one in terms of branching from sp2(m+ℓ) to sp2m ⊕ sp2ℓ
(although the second branching law involves infinite-dimensional representations).

                    7. More Reciprocity Algebras for (GLn , GLm )
   Whereas our first example of a reciprocity algebra in §4.1 involved only finite-dimensional
representations, the others all involve infinite-dimensional representations in some respect.
It turns out that the apparently exceptional nature of the reciprocity algebra for the pair
(GLn , GLm ) is somewhat deceptive. In fact, we can associate several reciprocity algebras to
(GLn , GLm ), and nearly all of them will involve infinite-dimensional representations.
   We shall refer to §3.3.1 and consider the action of GLn on P(Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n ) by the rule
                                    g · f (x, y) = f (g tx, y(g t)−1 )                              (7.1)
for x ∈ Mn,m , y ∈ Mℓ,n and g ∈ GLn . Recall from Theorem 3.3(c) that the algebra Jen,m,ℓ
                (2,0)
generated by glm,ℓ . It is the space of all polynomials on P(Mn,m ⊕Mℓ,n ) invariant under GLn .
Let Hen,m,ℓ be the space of GLn -harmonics and recall the GLn × GLm × GLℓ isomorphism
(see Theorem 3.5(c)):
                              P(Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n )/I(Jen,m,ℓ

        Here the partitions µ+ , µ− , ν + , ν − , λ+ , λ− are such that ℓ(µ+ ) ≤ m, ℓ(µ− ) ≤ ℓ,
        ℓ(µ+ ) + ℓ(µ− ) ≤ n, ℓ(ν + ) ≤ m′ , ℓ(ν − ) ≤ ℓ′ , ℓ(ν + ) + ℓ(ν − ) ≤ n, ℓ(λ+ ) ≤ m + m′ ,
        ℓ(λ− ) ≤ ℓ + ℓ′ and ℓ(λ+ ) + ℓ(λ− ) ≤ n.

Remarks: Recall from the remarks after Theorem 3.4 that we have written glm,ℓ instead of
glm+ℓ to emphasize the interplay of the two components Mn,m and Mℓ,n .
Proof. From the above description of P(Mn,m ⊕ Mℓ,n ), we can see using (3.11) that

is a multiplicity-free sum of representations F(n)     of GLn . Again, this can be embedded
as a (0, 1)-subalgebra of the coordinate ring of GLn /Un .
   Now repeat this with m′ in place of m and ℓ′ in place of ℓ. We again get a multiplicity-free
sum of a family of representations of GLn . If we take the tensor product of the two sums,
                                                   25

which tells us about the glm,ℓ ⊕ glm′ ,ℓ′ decomposition in the representation Fe(m+m′ ,ℓ+ℓ′ ) of
gl(m+m′ ),(ℓ+ℓ′ ) . This completes the proof.  

  The construction of §4.1 of course is just the case ℓ = 0 = ℓ′ of the current discussion.
That case is notable for staying completely in the context of finite-dimensional representation
theory. Another case of interest is when ℓ = 0 = m′ . Then, although the representations of
glm,ℓ′ are infinite dimensional, the representations of the subalgebras glm and glℓ′ are finite
dimensional. This case is analogous to branching from GLn to On (or from GL2n to Sp2n ).

     8. The Stable Range and Relations Between Reciprocity Algebras
  Let us summarize our discussions this far. Given any classical symmetric pair, we can
embed it in a (family of) see-saw symmetric pair(s). Doing this, we find that (a (0, 1)-
subalgebra of) the branching algebra for the pair can equally well be interpreted as the
branching algebra for a dual family of representations of the dual symmetric pair. The
representations of the dual symmetric pair will frequently be infinite dimensional, but they
are always highest weight modules.
  An immediate consequence of this isomorphism of algebras is the isomorphisms of inter-
twining spaces and hence equality of multiplicities, which we have collectively described as
                                                                   26
reciprocity laws. These reciprocity laws are of the same nature as Frobenius Reciprocity for
induced representations of groups.
   From §4.2, we see that the see-saw symmetric pairs actually come in two parameter fam-
ilies. If one of the pairs involves many more variables than the other, then certain features
of the discussions above become simpler.
   Take the results of Theorem 4.1 as an illustration: The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
for GLn ,
                                                          µ
                                                   λ
                              cλµν = dim HomGLn (F(n) , F(n)     ν
                                                             ⊗ F(n) )
                                                µ      ν      λ

are independent of n, if n ≥ m + ℓ, and depend only on the shape of the partitions µ, ν and
λ.
   Consider another example: branching from GL2n to Sp2n . If we let these groups act on
P(M2n,m ), we get the see-saw pairs (Sp2n , so2m ) and (GL2n , glm ). The branching coefficients
dµλ from GL2n to Sp2n can be described as follows:
                                                X µ µ

is independent of n, if n ≥ m, and only depends on the diagrams λ and µ. This allows one
to create a theory of “stable characters” for Sp2n . Similar considerations apply to GLn and
On and this idea has been actively pursued by [37], amongst others.
   These are all instances of stability laws. The well-known one-step branching from GLn
to GLn−1 is another instance. This branching can be described entirely by diagrams, with
no mention of the size n, if n is large. Iteration of this branching also shows that when n
is large, the weight multiplicities of dominant weights of an irreducible GLn representation
are independent of n. See [1] for the other classical groups, which don’t share this stability
property.
   In the sections that follow, we will illustrate the simplifications that occur in the stable
range, highlighting certain specific see-saw pairs. In all these cases, we show that the branch-
ing algebras associated to symmetric pairs can all be described by use of suitable branching
algebras associated to the general linear groups. Thus, if we can have control of the solution
in the general linear group case, we will have some control of the other classical groups. The
other non-trivial examples will be important extensions of this work, and we hope to see
them in further papers, for example, [16], [17] and [15].

                    9. Stability for Branching from GLn to On
  We begin with a detailed discussion of the case of (GLn , On ) and (sp2m , GLm ). Here we
have already encountered the stable range, without the name. It is when n > 2m. Several
things happen in the stable range:
                                               27
                               µ
   (a) The representations E(n)  of the orthogonal group remain irreducible when restricted
       to the special orthogonal group SOn , and furthermore, no two of them are equivalent.
   (b) Recall the algebra Jn,m of On -invariant polynomials on Mn,m generated by the qua-
                                                            (2,0)
       dratic invariants, which is the abelian subalgebra sp2m of sp2m . In the stable range
       (in fact it holds true whenever n ≥ m), the natural surjective homomorphism
                                                  (2,0)
                                          S(sp2m ) → Jn,m
       is an isomorphism. See Theorem 3.3(a).
   (c) In the stable range, the multiplication map
                                                              (2,0)
                          Hn,m ⊗ Jn,m ≃ Hn,m ⊗ S(sp2m ) → P(Mn,m )
       is also an isomorphism of On × GLm -modules. See Theorem 3.3(a).
  Of course, the subspace Hn,m of harmonic polynomials is not an algebra – it is not closed
under multiplication. This is quite clear, since Hn,m contains all the linear functions, which
generate the whole polynomial ring. However, to form the reciprocity algebra associated to
the symmetric see-saw pairs (GLn , On ) and (sp2m , GLm ), we need to take the UOn -invariants.
Thus, our reciprocity algebra is a subalgebra of
                                          (2,0)                               (2,0)

Theorem 9.1. When n > 2m, the space Hn,m            is a subalgebra of P(Mn,m ). Hence, the
                 UO n
algebra P(Mn,m )      is isomorphic to a tensor product
                                                                      (2,0)

of the algebras Hn,m   and S(sp2m ). Furthermore, the algebra Hn,m  is isomorphic (as a
                                   +
representation) to the subalgebra R (GLm /Um ) of R(GLm /Um ) defined by the polynomial
representations.
                      U
Proof. Note that Hn,m     On
                             can be identified with a subalgebra R+ (GLm /Um ) of R(GLm /Um )
defined by the polynomial representations, from our discussion in §3.2. Consider the space
of polynomials belonging to the sum in the last expression of equation (9.1). Let
{xjk | j = 1, . . . , n, k = 1, . . . , m} be the standard matrix entries on Mn,m . In order to
make the unipotent group UOn of On maximally compatible with (in fact, contained in) the
unipotent subgroup Un of GLn , we choose the inner product on Cn as in Section 3.3.1. By this
choice, joint On × GLm harmonic highest weight vectors are monomials in the determinants
                                                      

                                      P     µ UO n        µ
From this, we can see that the space µ (E(n)    )     ⊗ F(m)  is spanned by the monomials in
the determinants
                                                            

                                              .     .     . 
                                     xj,b1 xj,b2 . . . xj,bj
as {b1 , b2 , b3 , . . . , bj } ranges over all j-tuples of integers from 1 to m. Indeed, the span of
such monomials is clearly invariant under glm , and consists of highest weight vectors for On .
Finally, we see that these monomials will all be harmonic, because the partial Laplacians
                 (0,2)
spanning sp2m have the form
                                            n
                                            X            ∂2
                                    ∆ab =                         .                            (9.4)
                                            j=1
                                                  ∂xj,a ∂xn+1−j,b

Since every term of ∆ab involves differentiating with respect to a variable xjk with j > n/2,
and the determinants (9.3) do not depend on these variables, we see that they will be
                                                                                      UO n
annihilated by the ∆ab , which means that they are harmonic. This shows that Hn,m          is a
subalgebra of P(Mn,m ).
  We have thus completed the proof of the theorem. 

  We can use the description in Theorem 9.1 of P(Mn,m )UOn to relate the branching algebra
P(Mn,m )UOn ×Um to the tensor product algebra for GLm . As a GLm -module, the space
  (2,0)
sp2m is isomorphic to S 2 (Cm ), the space of symmetric m × m matrices. It is well known
that the symmetric algebra S(S 2 (Cm )) is multiplicity-free as a representation of GLm , and
decomposes into a sum of one copy of each polynomial representation corresponding to a
diagram with rows of even length (or a partition of even parts):
                                                  M
                                   S(S 2 (Cm )) ≃       2ν
                                                      F(m) .                             (9.5)
                                                        ν

(Note that this result is in several places in the literature. See [10] and [14] for example.)
  As a GLm -module, S(S 2 (Cm )) could be embedded in R(GLm /Um ), but the algebra struc-
tures on these two algebras are quite different.
  Using the dominance filtration (see §3.2), we have a canonical A       b+ -algebra filtration on
S(S 2 (Cm )). If we form the associated graded algebra, then Theorem 3.2 says that it will
be isomorphic to the subalgebra of R(GLm /Um ) spanned by the representations attached to
diagrams with even length rows.
  Let us denote the associated graded algebra of S(S 2 (Cm )) by GrAb+m S(S 2 (Cm )). Let us
denote the subalgebra of R(GLm /Um ) spanned by the representations attached to diagrams
with even length rows by R+2 (GLm /Um ).
                                       UO n       (2,0)                                       (2,0)
  We can filter the tensor product Hn,m     ⊗ S(sp2m ) by means of the filtration on S(sp2m ).
                                                   UO n              (2,0)
The associated graded algebra will then be Hn,m         ⊗ GrAb+m S(sp2m ). This discussion has
indicated that the following result holds.
Theorem 9.2. When n > 2m, the associated graded algebra of P(Mn,m )UOn with respect to
the dominance filtration on the factor Jn,m is isomorphic to the tensor product of the graded
                                                   29
subalgebras R+ (GLm /Um ) and R+2 (GLm /Um ) of R(GLm /Um ):
                   GrAb+m (P(Mn,m )UOn ) ≃ R+ (GLm /Um ) ⊗ R+2 (GLm /Um ).

  Of course, GrAb+m (P(Mn,m )UOn ) is isomorphic as a GLm -module to P(Mn,m )UOn in an
obvious way, by construction. Also GrAb+m (P(Mn,m )UOn ) inherits the A        b+ grading from
                                                                                On
P(Mn,m ) UO n                                  b
              – it becomes identified with the Am grading on the first factor R+ (GLm /Um ) in
                                                 +

the tensor product of Theorem 9.2. On the other hand, the second factor is also A      b+ -graded
                                                                                        m
in the obvious way, since it is the factor which defines the associated graded. When we
take the Um invariants, we get another grading by A     b+ , associated to the Am action on the
                                                         m
Um invariants. This triply A b+
                              m -graded  algebra  is evidently  a (0, 1)-subalgebra of the tensor
product algebra of GLm .
  On the other hand, we could take the Um invariants inside P(Mn,m )UOn , and then pass to
the associated graded. It is not hard to convince oneself that these two processes commute
with each other. Hence, we finally have:
Corollary 9.3 When n > 2m, the associated graded algebra of Um invariants in P(Mn,m )UOn ,

   (a) the weight on the first factor of (R(GLm /Um ) ⊗ R(GLm /Um ))Um should correspond
       to a partition (i.e., it should be a polynomial weight), and
   (b) the weight on the second factor should correspond to a partition with even parts.

algebra for (GLn , On ) using [16]; see second preprint of [15].

  We can interpret this algebra in term of tensor product algebras for general linear groups.
According to Theorem 3.4(c) and (3.8), as a GLm × GLℓ module, we have
                                              M
                              S(Cm ⊗ Cℓ ) ≃         δ

                                                       ⊗ F(ℓ) .                        (10.3)
                                                         δ
We also know that                                            M           µ      ν
                          R(GLm /Um × GLℓ /Uℓ ) ≃                      F(m) ⊗ F(ℓ) .                    (10.4)
                                                                 µ,ν
Since this algebra is bigraded by µ and ν, we can consider the “diagonal” (0, 1)-subalgebra
                                                    M

                                                                   δ

resulting from requiring the two partitions to be the same. Evidently, the algebra S(Cm ⊗Cℓ )
is isomorphic to ∆R(GLm /Um × GLℓ /Uℓ ) as GLm × GLℓ -module. They are not isomorphic
as algebras, since ∆R(GLm /Um × GLℓ /Uℓ ) is graded by A   b+ × A
                                                                b+ , while S(Cm ⊗ Cℓ ) is not.

However, we may filter S(Cm ⊗ Cℓ ) by the representations of GLm × GLℓ (or of either factor)
using the dominance filtration (see §3.2), and then the associated graded algebra will be
isomorphic to ∆R(GLm /Um × GLℓ /Uℓ ) by Theorem 3.2:
                    GrAb+m ×Ab+ (S(Cm ⊗ Cℓ )) ≃ ∆R(GLm /Um × GLℓ /Uℓ ).

  Now turn to the first factor    λ (F(n) ) ⊗ F (m+ℓ)   on the right hand side of equation
(10.2). According to Theorem 4.1, we can write this as

  We may interpret the last expression in (10.7) analogously to (10.4) and (10.5). We have

requiring that all three diagonal conditions occur at once will be denoted by using all three

  Consider now branching from On+m to the product On × Om . We look at the action of
On+m on Mn+m,ℓ by multiplication on the left. Here we simply state the relationship of the
reciprocity algebra for (On+m , On × Om ) in the stable range, in relation to the GLn tensor
product algebras. We shall omit the proof.

possible to compute a basis of the reciprocity algebra for (On+m , On × Om ) using [17]; see

  Let On act by the usual left multiplication on Mn,m , the n × m matrices. We assume that
n ≥ 2m, which includes the stable range n > 2m. Let rij be the invariant pairing between
the i-th column and the j-th column. Recall that Jn,m = P(Mn,m )On is generated freely by
the homogeneous quadratic polynomials {rij } in this range (see [10] Theorem 5.2.7). Also,
the space of harmonics, i.e., polynomials annihilated by all the differential operators dual to
the rij ’s, is denoted by Hn,m as in Theorem 3.3(a).
Theorem (Separation of Variables) If n ≥ 2m, then
                                  P(Mn,m ) ≃ Hn,m ⊗ P(Mn,m )On

Remarks. Proofs of this result for orthogonal groups (see Theorem 2.5 of [62]) and for
symplectic groups (see Theorem 1.10 of [63]) are given by Ton-That using results of [38].
                                                                     +
Proof of Separation of Variables Theorem: Let I(Jn,m                    ) be the ideal in P(Mn,m )
                                                                                    +
generated by rij ’s with zero constant terms, and consider P(Mn,m ) as an I(Jn,m       ) module by
multiplication.
  We shall need the notion of a regular sequence. First, denote the ideal in P(Mn,m ) gen-
erated by {f1 , . . . , fs } by the symbol < f1 , . . . , fs > P(Mn,m ). A sequence {f1 , . . . , fk } ⊂
    +
I(Jn,m ) forms a regular sequence for P(Mn,m ) if
    (a) fi is not a zero-divisor on P(Mn,m )/ < f1 , . . . , fi−1 > P(Mn,m ) for all i = 1, . . . , k,
        and
    (b) P(Mn,m )/ < f1 , . . . , fk > P(Mn,m ) is non-zero.
   Geometrically, saying that a given function f is not a zero-divisor on
P(Mn,m )/ < f1 , . . . , fi−1 > is the same as saying that f does not vanish identically on any
irreducible component of the zero set of {f1 , . . . , fi−1 }. This in turn is the same as saying that
each irreducible component of {f1 , . . . , fi−1 , f } has dimension one less that the component
of the zero set of {f1 , . . . , fi−1 }.
   Separation of variables would follow from knowing that the rij ’s (in some order) form a
regular sequence for P(Mn,m ). In fact, you can take any order you want. For an ideal I in
a commutative ring S, we have the chain:
                                       S ⊇ I ⊇ I2 ⊇ I3 ⊇ . . .
and we can thus form the associated graded algebra
                                 GrI S = S/I ⊕ I/I 2 ⊕ I 2 /I 3 ⊕ . . .
with multiplication (setting S = I 0 )
                                 I i /I i+1 ⊗ I j /I j+1 −→ I i+j /I i+j+1
                                                                                      +
induced by multiplication on S. In our context, S = P(Mn,m ) and P(Mn,m )/I(Jn,m        ) is the
coordinate ring of the null-cone and as a linear space (in particular, as a On × GLm module),
                                          +
it is isomorphic to Hn,m . If {rij } ⊂ I(Jn,m ) is a regular sequence of P(Mn,m ), then we have
a nice presentation of GrI(Jn,m
                              +
                                ) P(Mn,m ):
                                                    34
Ree’s Theorem (see Theorem 2.1 of [56]) If I is generated by a regular sequence f1 , . . . , fn ,
then the map φ : (S/I)[x1 , . . . , xn ] ← GrI S, sending xi to the class fi in I/I 2 is an isomor-
phism.
   Ree’s Theorem thus implies that as vector spaces, we have S = S/I ⊗ C[f1 , . . . , fn ], and
in our context, P(Mn,m ) ∼
                         = Hn,m ⊗ Jn,m.
                                                                         +
   Thus we want to show that indeed {rij } form a regular sequence in I(Jn,m ). To show this,
                                                                 2   m
consider the map from Mn,m to the m × m symmetric matrices S (C ) by putting the rij in
a matrix:
               Q : Mn,m −→ S 2 (Cm )          where       Q(T ) = T t T,       T ∈ Mn,m .
First observe that this map is On × GLm equivariant:
                            Q(gT h) = ht Q(T )h,         g ∈ On , h ∈ GLm .
Further, the On and GLm actions commute.
   Let us study the fibers of the map Q. Define the following rank m matrices in Mn,m : For
k = 0, 1, . . . , m, let
                                      Tk = [c1 c2 . . . ck ck+1 . . . cm ] ∈ Mn,m
where {c1 , c2 , . . . , ck } is an orthonormal set of non-isotropic vectors in Cn and {ck+1 , . . . , cm }
is an orthogonal set of isotropic vectors in Cn , such that each of the cj with j > k are
orthogonal to the cj with j ≤ k. It is easy to see that
                                                                      
                                                               Ik 0
                                                Q(Tk ) =
                                                               0 0
where Ik is the k × k identity matrix.                Next, for i = 0, 1, . . . , k, define the sets
Θk ⊂ Mn,m as follows:
                Θk = {X ∈ Mn,m | Q(X) = Q(Tk ) and rank X = rank Tk = m}.
Let us remind our readers on the following version of Witt’s Theorem (see Theorem 3.7.1 of
[14]):
Witt’s Theorem Given two n × m matrices T1 and T2 , there is an orthogonal n × n matrix
g such that gT1 = T2 if and only if Q(T1 ) = Q(T2 ) and ker T1 = ker T2 .
  Since X and Tk are of full rank, i.e., rank X = rank Tk = m , thus ker X = ker Tk = {0}. By
Witt’s Theorem, Θk is an On orbit in the fiber Q−1 (Q(Tk )) ⊂ Mn,m . The full rank condition
gives the openness and denseness of this orbit. The null cone (or null fiber) NCQ = Θ0
corresponds to k = 0.
  We claim that the fibers of the map Q are all varieties of the same dimension, i.e., Q is
an equi-dimensional map:
Proposition Consider the On × GLm -equivariant map Q. Then for each Y ∈ S 2 (Cm ),
  (a) the fiber Q−1 (Y ) is an irreducible variety, invariant under On , and contains an open
      dense orbit of the form Θk · h, for some h ∈ GLm and some k = 0, 1, . . . , m.
  (b) the dimension of each fiber Q−1 (Y ) is f = nm − m(m+1) 2
                                                                 , which is independent of the
      fiber.
  Remark: The inverse image of any symmetric matrix contains exactly one On orbit
consisting of invertible matrices. This is dense in the whole inverse image. It is the condition
                                                    35
that n ≥ 2m which permits injective maps into isotropic subspaces (i.e., such that the pulled-
back form vanishes).                                                                        
                                      2   m                                      t       Ik 0
Proof of Proposition: For Y ∈ S (C ), we can find h ∈ GLm such that h Y h =                    ,
                                                                                         0 0
for some k = 0, 1, . . . , m.                                                               
                                                                 t             t         Ik 0
   If X ∈ Mn,m is such that Q(X) = Y , then Q(Xh) = h Q(X)h = h Y h =                          .
                                                                                         0 0
Further, rank Xh = rank X. In other words, the fiber Q−1 (Y ) associated to Y ∈ S 2 (Cm ) is
the closure of an open dense orbit given by Θk · h, and hence an irreducible variety.
   The fact that the orbits Θk (and their translates) have the same dimension follows from the
computation of the dimension of the pointwise stabilizer in On of Tk ∈ Mn,m . The pointwise
stabilizer can be easily computed for each k = 0, 1, . . . , m. The dimension of each fiber is
f = nm − m(m+1)2
                  . (You can see this dimension from the null cone pretty easily because the
ring of On invariants is freely generated by m(m+1)
                                                  2
                                                       polynomials rij ’s.) 
   Since the mapping Q has equi-dimensional fibres, if V ⊂ S 2 (Cm ) is any irreducible variety
of dimension e, then Q−1 (V ) will be an irreducible variety of dimension e + f . The Q(rij )’s
are coordinates on S 2 (Cm ), so the variety defined by d of them is a subspace of codimension
d. It follows that the pullback of this subspace by Q is also irreducible and of codimension
d. Therefore, the dimension of the zero set of rij ’s decrease by 1 at each stage, making {rij }
a regular sequence (see Lemma 4 on page 105 of [53]). 
