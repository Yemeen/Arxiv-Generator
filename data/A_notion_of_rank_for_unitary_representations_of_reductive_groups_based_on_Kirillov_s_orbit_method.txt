                                                                                      HADI SALMASIAN




                                                    Abstract. We introduce a new notion of rank for unitary representations of semisim-
                                                    ple groups over a local field of characteristic zero. The theory is based on Kirillov’s
                                                    method of orbits for nilpotent groups over local fields. When the semisimple group is a
                                                    classical group, we prove that the new theory is essentially equivalent to Howe’s theory
                                                    of N -rank [Hw1], [Li1], [Sca]. Therefore, our results provide a systematic generalization
                                                    of the notion of a small representation (in the sense of Howe) to exceptional groups.
                                                    However, unlike previous works which used ad-hoc methods to study different types of
                                                    classical groups (and some exceptional ones [Ws], [LS]), our definition is simultaneously
                                                    applicable to both classical and exceptional groups. The most important result of this
                                                    paper is a general “purity” result for unitary representations, which demonstrates how
                                                    similar partial results in the previous authors’ works should be formulated and proved
                                                    for an arbitrary semisimple group in the language of Kirillov’s theory. The purity result
                                                    is a crucial step towards studying small representations of exceptional groups. New
                                                    results concerning small unitary representations of exceptional groups will be published
                                                    in a forthcoming paper [Sa].

                                             1.1. Background. The theory of N-rank [Hw1], [Li1], [Sca] provides an effective tool
                                             for studying “small” unitary representations of classical semisimple groups. It is based
                                             on analysing the restriction of a unitary representation to large commutative subgroups
                                             of such groups. The study of the notion of N-rank began in [Hw1] where the theory
                                             was developed for the metaplectic group. Roughly speaking, one can attach equivalence
                                             classes of bilinear symmetric forms to unitary representations, and these equivalence
                                             classes canonically correspond to orbits of the adjoint action of the Levi component of

the Siegel parabolic on its unipotent radical. Later on, the theory was extended by J.
S. Li [Li1] and R.Scaramuzzi [Sca] to classical groups, and an intrinsic connection with
the theta correspondence was also found in [Li2]. Representations which correspond to
degenerate classes are called singular representations. They form a large class of non-
tempered representations and therefore their study is essentially complementary to that
of the tempered representations. It turns out that this class of representations is quite
well-behaved. In fact Howe gave a construction of a large class of such representations
[Hw3], and they are applied in construction of automorphic forms [Hw4],[Li3].

  The lack of a theory of N-rank which applies to the exceptional groups is in a sense
a defect of this theory due to substantial interest in the small representations of these
groups. Aside from some generalizations in the works of Loke and Savin [LS] and Sahi,
most recently Weissman [Ws] provides an analogue for p-adic split simply-laced groups
excluding E8 using the representation-theoretic analogue of a Fourier-Jacobi functor.

   Here we develop a theory of rank which can also be applied to (almost) all exceptional
groups. The word “almost” will be explained more precisely in the remark after Propo-
sition 3.1.1. Our theory relies on the structure of unipotent radicals of certain parabolic
subgroups which are naturally expressible as a sequence of extensions by Heisenberg
groups. In this paper these unipotent radicals are called H-tower groups (see Definition
3.2.5).

   The main point of this work is to show that although the abelian nilradicals in terms of
which rank was defined for classical groups are usually not available in exceptional cases,
the maximal unipotent subgroups of all semisimple groups have a common feature which
enables us to define a similar notion of rank, which is essentially equivalent to the older
one for classical groups. This result, apart from being interesting itself, provides the
main tool needed to study small representations of exceptional groups. One interesting
application of this result is that it enables us to obtain sharp bounds on the behaviour
of matrix coefficients of unitary representations of exceptional groups, a problem studied
in [LZ], [Oh] and [LS]. Results along this line of research will be published elsewhere [Sa].

  It is also possible to generalize Theorem 4.2 of [Hw1], which is the next step to-
wards classification of small representations of exceptional groups. However, there does
not seem to be any strong connection between the “exceptional theta correspondences”
which result from the author’s work and the ones that already exist in the literature (see
[DS], [MS] or [GRS] for instance). This makes the classification problem both harder
and more interesting at the same time. This is a work still in its preliminary stages.

   This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 1.2 is devoted to the notation used
throughout the article. In section 2 we recall some basics about the Heisenberg groups
and the Weil representation. In section 3 we define a specific unipotent subgroup of a
simple group with regard to which our rank is defined. The “rankable” representations
of this unipotent group are defined and studied briefly in section 4. Section 5 is devoted
to the statement and proof of the main theorems, which essentially assert that rank is a
nontrivial invariant of a representation. Section 6 shows why our new theory generalizes
the older one.

bring and Gregg Zuckerman for fruitful conversations/communications, and especially

tions and for mentioning the inaccuracies which existed in section 5 of an earlier version
of the paper.
1.2. Notation. In this section we introduce some notation which will be used through-
out this article. Throughout this paper, we will be working with a local field F which is
either R, C or a finite extension of Qp , p 6= 2. Let F be the algebraic closure of F, and G
be the F-points of an absolutely simple, simply connected linear algebraic group defined
over F, and GF be the group of F-rational points of G. We assume G is F-isotropic.
By the Kneser-Tits conjecture, which holds in the case of local fields (see Proposition
7.6 and Theorem 7.6 in [PR, §7.2]), GF is equal to the group generated by its unipotent
elements. (In the archimedean case, GF is a connected Lie group.) Let G be a finite
topological central extension of GF . (For the definition of a topological central extension,
the reader is referred to [Mo2, Chapter 1].)

   Take a maximally split Cartan subgroup H of G (which is also defined over F), and
let A be the maximal split torus inside H. Let A be the inverse image of AF in G.

  We denote the Lie algebras of the groups G, H, A, G, A by g, h, a, gF , aF respectively.
More precisely, g, h, a are F-Lie algebras and gF and aF are F-forms of the corresponding
algebras.

  Let ∆ be an absolute root system associated to h, and let Σ be the restricted (or rel-
ative, as some people call it) root system associated to a. The root space corresponding
to any α ∈ ∆ is denoted by gα , and the coroot for α is denoted by Hα .

   We fix a G-invariant symmetric bilinear form (·, ·) on g, normalized in such a way that
if for any two roots β, γ we define (β, γ) to be (Hβ , Hγ ), then (β, β) = 2 for any long root
β. All roots of simply-laced root systems are considered as long ones. For hF = h ∩ gF
we have
                                         hF = aF ⊕ tF
where tF is the orthogonal complement of aF in hF with respect to the invariant symmet-
ric bilinear form (·, ·) introduced above.

  As usual, ∆+ and Σ+ denote the set of positive roots. We assume ∆+ , when restricted
to a, contains Σ+ . Let ∆B and ΣB denote the bases for positive roots in the correspond-
ing root systems such that ∆B , when restricted to a, contains ΣB .

   The choice of a positive system determines a fixed Borel subalgebra b of g (or a minimal
parabolic pmin of gF ). A parabolic subalgebra of g (respectively, of gF ) is called standard
if it contains b (respectively, pmin ). We identify the standard parabolic subgroups and
subalgebras of g (respectively of gF ) by subsets of ∆B (respectively of ΣB ) they naturally
correspond to. More precisely, for any subset Φ ⊆ ∆B , by pΦ we mean the standard
4                                         HADI SALMASIAN

parabolic subalgebra of g which contains all root spaces gα for any α ∈ ∆+ as well as any
g−α′ such that α′ ∈ ∆+ is in the semigroup generated by Φ. The definition will be similar
for the parabolic subalgebra (this time of gF ) corresponding to any Φ ⊆ ΣB . Later on,
when there is no risk of confusion between the parabolics of g and gF , we use the more
concise notation pΦ for both situations. Also, again for simplicity and when there is no
risk of ambiguity, Lie subalgebras of both g and gF may be denoted by Gothic letters in
a similar way; i.e. without a subscript “F” in the case of a Lie subalgebra of gF .

  The standard parabolic subgroups of G and G are denoted by PΦ and PΦ respectively.
Note that a parabolic subgroup of G means the inverse image of a parabolic subgroup of
GF in G. In other words, if the short exact sequence
                                            i           p
(1.1)                      1 −−−→ F −−−→ G −−−→ GF −−−→ 1
(where F is a finite subgroup of the center of G) represents our topological central
extension, then a parabolic P of G is of the form P = p−1 (PF ) for an F-parabolic P of
G. It follows from [Du, II 11 Lemme] (or from an explicit construction of the universal
central extension by Deodhar [De, Section 1.9]) that topological central extensions of
semisimple groups over local fields are split over the unipotent subgroups 1 and therefore
one can have an analogous “Levi” decomposition in G as well; i.e. if P = p−1 (PF ) and
P = LN is a Levi decomposition of P (with L being the reductive factor and N being
the unipotent radical) then one can express P as P = LN, where:
     1. L = p−1 (LF ).

      2. N ⊆ p−1 (NF ) is a normal subgroup of P and the map
                                            p : N 7→ NF
         is an isomorphism of topological groups. (Existence of N is what follows from
         the results of Duflo or Deodhar cited above.)
   We may as well drop the subscript Φ of the standard parabolics PΦ and PΦ when there
is no risk of confusion about the identifying subset Φ of simple positive roots. Moreover,
whenever a parabolic subgroup or subalgebra is standard, we assume that the Levi de-
composition considered above is also standard.

   Let K be an arbitrary locally compact group. Then the center of K will be denoted
by Z(K). Unitary representations of K are defined in the usual way (see [Mac1]) and
denoted by Greek letters. The unitary dual of K (which is the set of equivalence classes of
the irreducible unitary representations of K endowed with the Fell topology) is denoted
by K̂. Now suppose K ′ is a closed subgroup of K and let σ, σ ′ be unitary representations
                                                        K ′
of K, K ′ respectively. Then, as usual, ResK
                                           K ′ σ and IndK ′ σ mean restriction and unitary
induction. If there is no ambiguity about K, we use the simpler notation σ|K ′ instead of
ResKK ′ σ.


    Suppose l is an arbitrary Lie algebra. Then the center of l is denoted by z(l).

      fact an abstract (and hence topological) universal central extension of GF splits over the maximal
unipotent subgroup. I am indebted to Gopal Prasad for pointing to reference [De].

                   2. Heisenberg group and Weil representation
2.1. Heisenberg groups and algebras. Let n be a positive integer. An F-Heisenberg
group (or simply a Heisenberg group) Hn is a two-step nilpotent 2n + 1-dimensional
F−group which is isomorphic to the subgroup of GLn+2 (F) of unipotent, upper-triangular
matrices which do not have nonzero elements outside the diagonal, the first row and the
last column. This group has a one-dimensional center. We denote the Lie algebra of Hn
by hn . Since Hn ⊂ GLn+2 (F), hn sits in the usual way inside gln+2 (F).

  The Lie algebra hn of Hn can also be described more abstractly as
                                           hn = Wn ⊕ z
with the Lie bracket introduced below, where Wn is a 2n-dimensional space endowed with
a nondegenerate symplectic form < ·, · >, and z is the center of hn , a one-dimensional Lie
subalgebra. We fix a Lie algebra isomorphism between z and F, and denote the element
in z corresponding to 1 ∈ F by Z. The Lie bracket on Wn is defined as follows:
                      for every X, Y ∈ Wn ,          [X, Y ] =<X, Y >Z.
   Viewing hn as a subalgebra of gln+2 (F), the exponential map of GLn+2 (F) gives a bijec-
tion between hn and Hn , and Z(Hn ) is equal to exp(z). This bijection is the exponential
map of Hn .

2.2. Stone-von Neumann theorem. We briefly mention the structure of irreducible,
infinite-dimensional unitary representations of a Heisenberg group. For a more detailed
discussion, the reader can study [Hw2], [CG] or [Tay, Chapter 1] for instance.

  The Stone-von Neumann theorem states that for any nontrivial unitary character of
Z(Hn ), up to unitary equivalence there is a unique infinite-dimensional irreducible uni-
tary representation of Hn having this central character. We will describe an explicit
realization (the so-called Schrödinger model) for this representation below.

  Consider an arbitrary polarization of Wn , i.e. a decomposition of Wn as a direct sum
(2.1)                                      Wn = xn ⊕ yn
of maximal isotropic subspaces. It is possible to choose bases {X1 , . . . , Xn } and {Y1 , . . . , Yn }
of xn and yn respectively such that
(2.2)                                    < Xi , Yj >= δi,j .
There is an isomorphim
(2.3)                                       e : xn ≈ y∗n
obtained via the symplectic form. Z(Hn ) ≈ exp(F) and any nontrivial multiplicative
(unitary) character of Z(Hn ) is equal to χ ◦ exp−1 , for some χ, where χ can be any
nontrivial additive (unitary) character of z(hn ) ≈ F. Such characters χ are in one-to-one
correspondence with elements of F − {0}. √    For example, if F = R, χ will be of the form
         ixy
χ(x) = e for some y ∈ R − {0} (here i = −1). This follows from the well-known fact
that the unitary dual of a local field is identifiable to itself (see [We1]).

  The (irreducible) representation ρ of Hn with central character χ may be realized on
the Hilbert space
                                      Hρ = L2 (yn )
                   Pn
as follows. Let y = i=1 yi Yi ∈ yn . Then Hn acts on Hρ as
                                (ρ(etXi )f )(y) = χ(−tyi )f (y)
(2.4)                           (ρ(etYi )f )(y) = f (y + tYi )
                                 (ρ(etZ )f )(y) = χ(t)f (y).
This representation is irreducible and unitary with respect to the usual inner product of
Hρ .

Notation. Henceforth, whenever a locally compact group N is isomorphic to a Heisen-
berg group, we denote the subset of N̂ consisting of the family of the infinite-dimenional
representations constructed above by N̂◦ .
2.3. The Weil representation. Let Sp(Wn ) be the symplectic group associated to Wn .
When F = C, take Mp(Wn ) = Sp(Wn ), and otherwise let Mp(Wn ) be the (metaplectic)
double covering of Sp(Wn ) (see [We2]). Mp(Wn ) acts through Sp(Wn ) on Hn ≈ exp(hn )
(or equivalently on hn ) as follows. For any w ⊕ z ∈ Wn ⊕ z,
                                    g : w ⊕ z → g · w ⊕ z.
One can consider the semidirect product Mp(Wn ) ⋉ Hn . We have (see [We2]):
Proposition 2.3.1. Let χ be any nontrivial additive character of F. Then the irreducible
unitary representation ρ of Hn with central character χ can be extended to a unitary
representation (still denoted by ρ) of Mp(Wn ) ⋉ Hn ; i.e. for any g ∈ Mp(Wn ) and any
h ∈ Hn :
                               ρ(g)ρ(h)ρ(g −1 ) = ρ(ghg −1 ).

                        3. Construction of H-tower groups
3.1. The Heisenberg parabolic. We use the notation of section 1.2. Let β̃ be the
highest root in ∆ with respect to the positive system chosen in section 1.2 and let Hβ̃ be
the coroot for β̃. Let (·, ·) denote the G-invariant symmetric bilinear form introduced in
that section; i.e. (β̃, β̃) = 2. One obtains a grading
                                               M
                                          g=      gj

where gj is the j-eigenspace of ad(Hβ̃ ); i.e.

Note that in fact gk = {0} for |k| > 2. The Jacobi identity implies [gi , gj ] ⊆ gi+j . Note
that g1 = g−1 = {0} if and only if g = sl2 .

Condition (3.1) is not a crucial assumption. In fact the author believes that it can be
removed. See the discussion in the remark after Proposition 3.1.1.
Proposition 3.1.1. Let g satisfy condition (3.1). Then
     1. g0 ⊕ g1 ⊕ g2 is a parabolic subalgebra, g1 ⊕ g2 is its nilradical, and
                                      [[g0 , g0 ], g2 ] = {0}.
        The nilradical is a Heisenberg Lie algebra with center g2 and symplectic space
        g1 . One can describe the symplectic form <·, ·>1 on g1 using the Lie bracket as
        follows: fix X2 ∈ g2 − {0} and let <·, ·>1 be such that
                      for every X, Y ∈ g1 ,       [X, Y ] =<X, Y >1 ·X2 .
        Then <·, ·>1 will be nondegenerate, and the (adjoint) representation of [g0 , g0 ] on
        g1 will be a symplectic representation with respect to <·, ·>1 .

     2. When g is not of type Al (l > 1), the parabolic of part 1 is characterized by
        the subset ∆B − {β} of ∆B for the unique simple root β ∈ ∆B which satisfies
        (β, β̃) 6= 0. For type Al (l > 1), there are two such simple roots β ′, β ′′ , and the
        parabolic corresponds to ∆B − {β ′ , β ′′ }.

     3. When g is not of type Al (l > 1), β corresponds to a simple restricted root (still
        denoted by β). For g of type Al (l > 2) and gF non-split, the pair {β ′, β ′′ } corre-
        sponds to a simple restricted root β in the restricted root system.

Let the sets S ⊂ ∆B and T ⊂ ΣB be defined as follows. Set S = {β} when g is not of
type Al (l > 1) and S = {β ′, β ′′ } otherwise. Also, set T = {β ′ , β ′′ } when gF is split and
g is of type Al (l > 1), and T = {β} otherwise.

     4. The parabolic p∆B −S is defined over F, and (p∆B −S )F = pΣB −T . Its nilradical is
        a Heisenberg algebra. p∆B −S is a maximal parabolic when g is not of type Al ,
        (l > 1).
Proof. See [GW, §2] and [Tor, §10].                                                           

Remark. The assumption that g satisfies condition (3.1) holds for all but a very small
class of Lie algebras g. Fox example, when F = R, the cases where β̃ is not defined over R
are f4(−20) , e6(−26) , sp(p, q), and sl(n, H). The notion of rank in this paper is based on the
existence of a unipotent subgroup of G which is expressible as a tower of extensions by
Heisenberg groups (see Definition 3.2.5), and therefore it is not applicable to the groups
mentioned above. However, in all of these groups there does exist a similar structure
which is called an OKP subgroup in [HRW]. Therefore in principle the main results of
this paper (especially Theorem 5.3.2) should generalize to groups associated with these
real forms. However, addressing the technical problems which arise with including those
cases in this paper makes it much more technical. To keep our presentation as simple
and uniform as possible, we do not include those special cases in this paper. The author
intends to deal with those cases elsewhere.

Definition 3.1.2. The parabolic subalgebras p∆B −S of g and pΣB −T of gF or their corre-
sponding parabolic subgroups P∆B −S of G and PΣB −T = (P∆B −S )F of GF (or the parabolic
of G which corresponds to PΣB −T ) are called the Heisenberg parabolics.
  We tend to drop their identifying subscripts for simplicity when there is no risk of
confusion.

3.2. The H-tower subgroup NΓ of G. Let g be as in condition (3.1). In this section
we describe a nilpotent subalgebra of g (and another one of gF ) which is fundamental to
our definition of rank. The construction of these nilpotent subalgebras is based on what
is usually referred to as Kostant’s Cascade. We show that this nilpotent Lie subalgebra
is actually the nilradical of a parabolic subalgebra (see Propositions 3.2.3 and 3.2.4).
The unipotent subgroup of G which corresponds to this nilpotent subalgebra will play
an important role in the rest of the paper.

   First assume that g splits over F; i.e. all roots of g are defined over F. Let p = l ⊕ n
be the Heisenberg parabolic of g, obtained by Proposition 3.1.1, with the usual Levi
decomposition; i.e. l is the Levi factor and n is the nilradical of p. In the case of
orthogonal algebras the commutator [l, l] is not a simple Lie algebra. In fact when g is
of types Bl (l ≥ 3) or Dl (l > 4), the commutator [l, l] is a direct sum of the form
(3.2)                                 [l, l] = sl2 ⊕ s
where s is simple. When g is of type D4 , we have
                                  [l, l] = sl2 ⊕ sl2 ⊕ sl2 .

Definition 3.2.1. Let m be defined as follows:
    I. If g is of types Dl (l > 4) or Bl (l > 3) then m is equal to the summand s given
       in (3.2).

    II. If g is of types A2 , A3 , B2 = C2 , B3 , D4 or G2 then m = {0}.

   III. Otherwise, m = [l, l].
   One can repeatedly apply Proposition 3.1.1 as follows. First we apply it to m. If m
is nonzero, then m 6= sl2 and Proposition 3.1.1 guarantees the existence of a Heisenberg
parabolic in m. Let p′ be this parabolic of m, and let l′ be the Levi factor of p′ . Let
m′ be the subalgebra of [l′ , l′ ] which is defined in the same way that m was defined as
a subalgebra of [l, l] in Definition 3.2.1. Then we apply Proposition 3.1.1 to m′ , and so
on. This process can be repeated as long as Proposition 3.1.1 can be applied. As a
result, we obtain a sequence S1 , . . . , Sr of subsets of ∆B , where each Si , defined as in
part 2 of Proposition 3.1.1, contains either a simple root or a pair of simple roots. Each
Si corresponds to the “highest root” β̃i obtained in the i-th step. We also denote the
sequence of Heisenberg parabolics by p1 , . . . , pr , with the Levi decomposition
(3.3)                                   pj = lj ⊕ nj .
Therefore, p1 is the Heisenberg parabolic of g, p2 is the Heisenberg parabolic of m, and
                                        ′                           ′
so on. Each nj is normalized by any lj for j ′ ≥ j and hence by nj . For a similar reason,
  ′
nj acts trivially on the center of nj . Each nj is isomorphic to a Heisenberg algebra hdi
for some di . Therefore the Lie algebra n1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ nr is a tower of successive extensions
by Heisenberg F-algebras. The following proposition is obvious.
Proposition 3.2.2. n1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ nr is equal to the nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra pΓ
of g where

                                 Γ = ∆B − (S1 ∪ . . . ∪ Sr ).
  Now assume g satisfies condition (3.1) but it is not necessarily F-split. Recall that the
positive system for Σ is compatible with the one for ∆. We can apply Proposition 3.1.1
repeatedly again. Note that the number of possible iterations for a non-split F-form of
g is often smaller than the number of possible iterations in the split case. (In certain
groups with small rank, they may be equal.) This is because the successive Levi factors
may fail to satisfy condition (3.1).

    Part 3 of Proposition 3.1.1 yields a sequence T1 , . . . , Ts of subsets of ΣB (for some
s ≤ r) where each Tj contains a simple restricted root or a pair of them. Again we
obtain a nested sequence
                                       p1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ps
of Heisenberg parabolics (this time inside gF ) and the nilradical of any pi is normalized
                            ′
by the nilradical of any pi when i < i′ . Therefore p1 is the Heisenberg parabolic subal-
gebra of gF . We warn the reader that the new pi ’s are different from those which appear
immediately before Proposition 3.2.2; in fact the older pi ’s are obtained from the newer
pi ’s by an extension of scalars.

   Tables II and III explain how Proposition 3.1.1 is applied iteratively to gF . For sim-
plicity, the real and the p-adic cases are separated: Table II is for the p-adic case and
Table III is for the real case.

   The column gF in Table II shows the Tits index of gF and the column mF shows the
Tits index of mF . For any gF the number s is given too. Real exceptional Lie algebras
in Table III are identified by the symmetric pairs (gR , kR ). The only F-forms of g which
appear in the columns gF of both of the tables are those for which g satisfies condition
(3.1). If an entry in the column corresponding to mF is equal to “–”, this means either
that the Lie algebra m is equal to {0} or that the Lie algebra m is semisimple but it does
not satisfy condition (3.1), i.e. the highest root of m is not defined over F. Therefore one
can use Tables II and III to see how many times Proposition 3.1.1 can be applied to a
particular F-form of g.

     We denote the nilradical of the parabolic pj of gF by hj . It is an F-Heisenberg algebra.


Proposition 3.2.3. The nilpotent Lie subalgebra h1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ hs of gF is equal to the
nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra pΓ of gF where
                                   Γ = ΣB − (T1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ts ).
   Moreover, we have the following proposition, which describes the relationship between
n ’s and hi ’s.
 i


Proposition 3.2.4. Let pΓ be the parabolic subalgebra of gF defined in Proposition 3.2.3
with Levi decomposition pΓ = lΓ ⊕ nΓ . Then
                                    nΓ ⊗ F = n1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ ns
(where the nj ’s are the same as those which appear in Proposition 3.2.2) and thus nΓ ⊗ F
is equal to the nilradical of the parabolic pΓ′ of g where
                                  Γ′ = ∆B − (S1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ss ).
   Therefore PΓ′ is an F-parabolic of G and (PΓ′ )F = PΓ , where PΓ is the parabolic of
G which is associated to the set Γ ⊆ ΣB defined in Proposition 3.2.3. PΓ will play a
significant role in the rest of the paper. Its Levi decomposition can be written as
(3.4)                                     PΓ = LΓ NΓ .
Definition 3.2.5. Let U be the group of F-points of a unipotent linear algebraic F-group
U. U is said to be an “H-tower” group if and only if it satisfies one of the properties I
or II below.
     I. U = {1}; i.e. U is trivial.
    II. U is isomorphic to a semidirect product U ′ ⋉ U ′′ where
           i. U ′′ is an F-Heisenberg group and is the group of F-points of an algebraic
              F-subgroup U′′ of U.
          ii. U ′ is the group of F-rational points of an algebraic subgroup U′ of U and the
              action of U ′ on U ′′ in the semidirect product U ′ ⋉U ′′ comes from an algebraic
              action (defined over F) of U′ on U′′ by group automorphisms of U′′ (which,
12                                          HADI SALMASIAN

                  a fortiori, leave elements of Z(U′′ ) invariant and act on the symplectic space
                  U′′ /Z(U′′ ) via symplectic operators) 2.
             iii. U ′ is an H-tower group.
     Therefore an H-tower group U can be expressed as a tower of successive extensions:

(3.5)                  U = H 1 · H 2 · · · H t = H 1 ⋊ (· · · ⋊ (H t−1 ⋊ H t ) · · · )
where each H j is a Heisenberg group; i.e. H j = Hdj for some dj (see section 2.1).

Remarks.
1. The name “H-tower” is chosen so that it reminds the reader that the group is a tower
of extensions by Heisenberg groups.

2. Real H-tower groups form a subclass of OKP groups defined in [HRW].

3. The number t in (3.5) is referred to as the height of the tower of extensions. It will
be denoted by ht(U).

4. Consider an H-tower group U which is expressed as in (3.5). for any j ∈ {1, ..., ht(U)}
we denote the quotient group H j · · · H ht(U ) ≈ U/H 1 · · · H j−1 by Uj . Uj is also an H-tower
group.

     If in (3.5) we take U = NΓ and H j = exp hj , then by Proposition 3.2.3 we have
Proposition 3.2.6. NΓ is an H-tower group and ht(NΓ ) = s, where s is as in Proposition
3.2.3.
                   4. Rankable representations of H-tower groups
4.1. Oscillator extension and rankable representations. Fix an H-tower group U,
expressed as a tower of successive extensions as in (3.5). Let χ1 be a nontrivial additive
character of F, and consider the unitary representation ρ1 of H 1 with central character
χ1 (see section 2.2). When restricted to the inverse image (in the metaplectic group) of
the maximal unipotent subgroup of the symplectic group, the Weil representation factors
through a representation of the maximal unipotent subgroup of the symplectic group.
(In fact the two-fold central extension of the symplectic group splits over the maximal
unipotent subgroup and, more importantly, this splitting is unique. This holds because
any two splittings would differ by a finite-order character, whereas the maximal unipotent
subgroup is a divisible group and therefore it does not have such characters.) Therefore,
any representation ρ of any Heisenberg group Hn with central character χ (see section
2.2) is extendable to the unipotent radical of any Borel subgroup of the symplectic group
Sp(Wn ). This implies that the representation ρ1 of H 1 is extendable (in at least one
way) to U. We still denote this extension by ρ1 . Note that the extension of ρ1 is not
necessarily unique, as one can for example twist it by a one dimensional representation
of U which is trivial on H 1 . However, since the extension of ρ to the metaplectic group
is unique, we can distinguish the extension of ρ1 obtained by the restriction of the Weil
     2This
        means that there is an F-homomorphism of algebraic groups Φ : U′ 7→ Sp (U′′ /Z(U′′ )) and
consequently Φ(U ′ ) ⊆ Sp (U ′′ /Z(U ′′ )) .

representation without ambiguity. Let ρ1 mean this specific extension.

  In a similar fashion, for any j > 1 one can construct a representation of
                            Uj = U/H 1 · · · H j−1 ≈ H j · · · H ht(U )
as follows. We take an arbitrary nontrivial additive character χj of F, and the represen-
tation ρj of H j with central character χj . As before, we use the Weil representation to
extend ρj to Uj . Since
                                  Uj ≈ U/H 1 · · · H j−1 ,
this representation can be extended to U, trivially on H 1 · · · H j−1 . Thus using ρj we have
constructed a representation of U. We still keep the notation ρj for this representation.
Definition 4.1.1. Let U be an H-tower group described as in (3.5). A representation of
U is called “rankable” if and only if it is unitarily equivalent to a tensor product of the
form
                                    ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk
for some k ≤ ht(U), where ρj is the representation of U which is obtained (using the Weil
representation) by extending the irreducible representation of H j with central character
χj . The rank of a k-fold tensor product (including the case k = 0, i.e. the trivial
representation) is defined to be k. If σ is a rankable representation of rank k, we write
rank(σ) = k
Remark. It follows from Corollary 4.2.3 that rank(σ) is well-defined; i.e. it is an
invariant of the unitary equivalence class of σ.
4.2. Kirillov theory for rankable representations. We denote the coadjoint orbit
attached to an irreducible unitary representation σ of a nilpotent group by Oσ∗ . (See
[Kr1], [Kr2, Chapter 3], [CG] or [Ki, §2.2] for elaborated treatments of Kirillov’s orbital
theory.) In his seminal paper [Kr1], Kirillov developed his method of orbits for simply
connected nilpotent real Lie groups. However, later in his 1966 ICM lecture he explained
that essentially the same theory can be applied to algebraic unipotent groups over p-adic
fields. See also [Mo1, §4] for more details.

Lemma 4.2.1. Let N be the group of F-rational points of a unipotent linear algebraic F-
group N. Let σ be an irreducible unitary representation of N and let Oσ∗ be the coadjoint
orbit attached to it. Then Oσ∗ is an analytic manifold in the sense of [Se, Chapter III,
§2].
Proof. The lemma follows immediately from [PR, §3.1, Corollary 2].                            
  Lemma 4.2.1 implies that one can speak of the dimension of a coadjoint orbit. (The
transitivity under the group action implies that the dimension is the same around every
point.) For any coadjoint orbit O∗ , let dim O∗ denote its dimension.
Lemma 4.2.2. Let N be a unipotent algebraic group such that N = N′ ⋉ N′′ as algebraic
F-groups (and the action of N′ on N′′ is defined over F) and let N = N ′ ⋉N ′′ be the group
of F-rational points of N (where N ′ , N ′′ are the F-points of N′ , N′′ ). Let the Lie algebras
of N ′ , N ′′ be n′ , n′′ respectively. The Lie algebra of the semidirect product N = N ′ ⋉ N ′′
is n = n′ ⊕ n′′ as a vector space, and we have a canonical isomorphism of dual spaces
14                                       HADI SALMASIAN

n∗ = n′ ∗ ⊕ n′′ ∗ . Let σ ′ , σ ′′ be irreducible unitary representations of N ′ , N ′′ respectively,
such that
    1) σ ′ is an irreducible unitary representation of N ′ , extended trivially on N ′′ to a
       representation σ̃ ′ of N.
    2) σ ′′ is an irreducible unitary representation of N ′′ which extends to a unitary rep-
       resentation σ̃ ′′ of N. (In other words, ResN             ′′  ′′
                                                          N ′′ σ̃ = σ .)
  Then σ̃ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ is an irreducible representation of N and

                              dim Oσ̃∗ ′ ⊗σ̃′′ = dim Oσ∗ ′ + dim Oσ∗ ′′ .
Proof. Consider the map j defined as the composition
                            N 7→ N × N 7→ N/N ′′ × N ≈ N ′ × N
where the leftmost map is the diagonal embedding and the middle map (i.e. the map
N × N 7→ N/N ′′ × N) is projection onto the first factor (i.e. it is given by (n1 , n2 ) 7→
(n1 N ′′ , n2 )). Observe that

                                                        ′
                                                        ×N ′ ˆ ′′
(4.1)                              σ̃ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ = ResN
                                                     j(N ) σ ⊗σ̃ .

  It is easily seen by Mackey theory [Mac1, Theorem 3.12] that σ̃ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ is irreducible.
Now take a maximal chain of analytic subgroups
                           N ′ × N = N 0 ⊃ N 1 ⊃ N 2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ j(N)
such that each N j has codimension 1 in N j−1 . It follows from (4.1) that if σ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ is
considered as a representation of N j−1 , then
                                                  j−1
                                               N
                                            ResN j σ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′
is an irreducible representation of N j . Now it follows from the statement of Theorem
2.5.1 of [CG] that for any such j we are in the situation of part (b) of that theorem. But
then Proposition 1.3.4 of [CG] implies that in this case, the dimension of the coadjoint
orbit of σ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ considered as a representation of N j is the same as the dimension of the
coadjoint orbit of σ ′ ⊗ σ̃ ′′ considered as a representation of N j−1 . Consequently,
                                   dim Oσ∗ ′ ⊗σ̃         ∗
                                             ˆ ′′ = dim Oσ̃′ ⊗σ̃′′ .

     Now consider the map q such that
                                     q : N ′ × N ′′ 7→ N ′ × N
which is defined to be the identity map N ′ 7→ N ′ in the first component and the injection
N ′′ ⊂ N in the second component. Then
                                        ′
                                     N ×N           ′ ˆ ′′  ′ ˆ ′′
                                  Resq(N ′ ×N ′′ ) σ ⊗σ̃ = σ ⊗σ


which is an irreducible representation. Again a similar argument (taking a maximal
chain, etc.) proves that
                                  dim Oσ∗ ′ ⊗σ̃         ∗
                                                           ˆ ′′ .
                                            ˆ ′′ = dim Oσ′ ⊗σ
But the coadjoint orbit Oσ∗ ′ ⊗σ              ∗     ∗
                              ˆ ′′ equals Oσ′ × Oσ′′ , which completes the proof. 
  One can apply Lemma 4.2.2 to any H-tower group iteratively and obtain the following
result.
                  A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                           15

Corollary 4.2.3. Let U be an H-tower group as in (3.5). Let
                                  σ = ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk
be a rankable representation of U. (Recall that ρj is extended from a representation of
H j with central character χj .) Then σ is irreducible. Moreover, as an analytic manifold,
the coadjoint orbit Oσ∗ has dimension 2(n1 + · · · + nk ), where
                                            dimhj − 1
                                     nj =             .

                                  5. Main theorems
5.1. Technical issues of central extensions. Let G, G, g be as in section 1.2 such
that g satisfies condition (3.1). Let P be the Heisenberg parabolic of G (see Definition
3.1.2). Suppose P = LN is the Levi decomposition of P . Therefore N is a Heisenberg
group. As in section 2.2 let ρ be the irreducible unitary representation of N with an ar-
bitrary nontrivial central character χ. Let NΓ be the H-tower subgroup of G constructed
in section 3.2 and assume ht(NΓ ) > 1.

   This section is mainly devoted to a technical issue which arises with central extensions
of G. The main result is Proposition 5.1.1. To avoid being distracted from the main
point of the paper, the reader may assume Proposition 5.1.1 and go on to section 5.2.

   Proposition 3.1.1 implies that the adjoint action provides a group homomorphism
[L, L] 7→ Sp(N/Z(N)). Our next aim is to somehow apply Proposition 2.3.1 and extend
ρ to a representation of a larger group which at least contains NΓ . One natural candidate
could be [P, P ]. However, when F 6= C, in order to extend the representation ρ of N to
[P, P ] we need to know that indeed the group homomorphism [L, L] 7→ Sp(N/Z(N)) is
a composition of a group homomorphism into the metaplectic group, i.e.
                                 [L, L] 7→ Mp(N/Z(N)),
and the projection map
                             Mp(N/Z(N)) 7→ Sp(N/Z(N)).
This issue was also dealt with in [Tor] (see [GS, Section 3.3]). We will explain it more
clearly below. In fact it can be seen that in some cases, if PF = LF NF is the Heisenberg
parabolic of GF , then [LF , LF ] does not act as a subgroup of the metaplectic group, and
therefore extending ρ to [PF , PF ] may not be possible. An obvious example is when GF
is the symplectic group. A less obvious example is the split group of type F4 . (Actually,
in both cases the extension is possible if we use the metaplectic covers. This may be
seen after some simple calculations. For real groups one can use the results of [Ad] which
tell us when a covering of a real simple Lie group splits over embedded root subgroups
SL2 (R). However, here we do not rely on such calculations.)

   To overcome this difficulty, we will see below that we have to consider an appropriate
finite (topological) central extension of G instead of G itself. Note that a representa-
tion of G can trivially be considered as a representation of its central extension, and we
can always study this extension instead of the original G because the central extension
has an H-tower subgroup too, which is identical to NΓ and is essentially obtained by
16                                    HADI SALMASIAN

exponentiating the corresponding nilpotent subalgebra nΓ of gF . This follows from what
was explained in section 1.2 as well, that a universal topological central extension of GF
splits over the maximal unipotent subgroup (see [Du, II 11 Lemme] or [De, Section 1.9]).
(In fact the splitting is unique because any two splittings would differ by a finite-order
character, whereas any unipotent subgroup is a divisible group and therefore it does not
have such characters.) Therefore, as far as it concerns the main results of this work, we
can substitute G with such a “good” central extension of G, without any loss of generality.

  To show the existence of this “good” central extension for an arbitrary G, first we
show its existence for the group GF . That is to say, we show that we can find a finite
topological central extension G̃F of GF in which the representation ρ of N can be ex-
tended to a larger subgroup. We warn the reader that we may (and will) think of N as
a subgroup of both GF and G̃F at the same time, since the latter group has a subgroup
identical to the subgroup N of the former one.

   Note that once we find G̃F , a simple argument implies that the required extension
exists for G as well. In fact the existence of a universal topological central extension of
GF implies that there will be a finite topological central extension which covers both G
and G̃F . This extension will be the one in which the extension of ρ to a larger subgroup
is possible.

     Next we show that we can find G̃F . Let
                                       î            p̂
                        1 −−−→ F −−−→ G̃F −−−→ GF −−−→ 1
be a finite topological central extension of GF . Let P = LN be the Heisenberg parabolic
of G with its usual Levi decomposition. Let L = p̂−1 (LF ) and let N be the unipotent
radical of P = p̂−1 (PF ). The group [L, L], the derived subgroup of L, is a product of
isotropic and anisotropic factors (see [Tor, §8.19]). Let Lis be the isotropic factor of
[L, L]. Let M be the simply connected subgroup of [L, L] whose Lie algebra is equal
to m, where m is the Lie algebra introduced in Definition 3.2.1. (The simply connect-
edness of M follows from [Tor, §8.19].) It follows from ht(NΓ ) > 1 that M ⊆ Lis . Let
M = p̂−1 (MF ).

     Recall that the adjoint action provides a map
                                    M 7→ Sp(N/Z(N)).
(See Proposition 3.1.1.) Let us call the inverse image of any subgroup M ′ of M inside
the metaplectic group Mp (N/Z(N)) the metaplectic extension of M ′ . It follows from
[Tor, §8.25 and §9.3] that if the F-points of the minimal nilpotent G-orbit of g contain
a G̃F -admissible orbit (see [Tor, §3.17] for the definition of an admissible orbit), then
there exists a closed subgroup M ′ of M, which is a normal subgroup of L, such that
p̂(M ′ ) ⊇ M+            +
            F (where MF is the subgroup of MF generated by its F-rational unipotent
elements) and the metaplectic extension of M ′ is trivial. (Note that in fact p̂(M ′ ) ⊇ MF ,
because by [Tor, §8.19], M is simply connected and therefore M+  F = MF (see [PR, §7.2]).)
This means that one can extend ρ to M ′ · N. We keep the notation ρ for such an ex-
tension. We will see below that the extension of ρ is actually uniquely determined on a
                    A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                                17

slightly smaller group, and therefore using ρ to denote the extension is not ambiguous.

   Tables in the end of [Tor] determine which groups GF have finite topological central
extensions G̃F with admissible orbits. Among all F-forms of groups G whose Lie algebras
g satisfy condition (3.1), the only groups which do not have coverings with admissible
orbits are groups of Tits index Br,r and Br,r−1 in the nonarchimedean case and SU(p, q)
and SO(p, q) when p + q is odd in the archimedean case. In these cases, however, the
metaplectic extension of MF is trivial by [Li2, Lemma 2.2] and [Kaz, Lemma 7]. Therefore
if M ′ = MF then ρ extends to M ′ . This settles the issue of existence of an appropriate
covering for GF .

   For a general G we can take G̃ as a finite topological central extension which cov-
ers both G and G̃F . Let M0 be the inverse image of M ′ in G̃. Obviously extending
ρ to M0 · N is possible. M0 has a closed finite-index subgroup M1 which is perfect
(i.e. [M1 , M1 ] = M1 ). M1 is found as follows. Define the sequence M (0) = M0 and
M (i) = [M (i−1) , M (i−1) ]. Then each M (i) is a subgroup of M ′ of finite index and the
indices are uniformly bounded (in fact one upper bound is the size of the kernel of the
map G̃ 7→ GF ). Therefore there is some i◦ such that M (i◦ ) = M (i◦ +1) ; i.e. M (i◦) is perfect.
Let M1 = M (i◦ ) , the closure of M (i◦ ) inside M ′ . Then M1 is perfect by [Tor, §8.11].

  The extension of ρ to M1 · N is unique. In fact the projective representation of M1 is
uniquely determined by the relation
               ρ(m)ρ(n)ρ(m−1 ) = ρ(mnm−1 )             for any n ∈ N, m ∈ M1
and since M1 is perfect, this projective representation lifts to a linear representation of
M1 in a unique way.

  The discussion in the previous paragraph proves the following result.
Proposition 5.1.1. Let G be as in section 1.2 such that g satisfies condition (3.1). Let
G be a finite topological central extension of GF represented as in (1.1). Let P, L, N, ρ be
as in the beginning of section 5.1. Then there exists a finite topological central extension
G̃ of GF which covers G as in
                                           ĩ         p̃
                          1 −−−→ F̃ −−−→ G̃ −−−→ G −−−→ 1
and a (closed) subgroup P1 = M1 · Ñ of G̃ such that
     i. p ◦ p̃(M1 ) = MF and p ◦ p̃(Ñ ) = NF .

    ii. Ñ is the unipotent radical of p̃−1 (P ); i.e. p̃ : Ñ 7→ N is an isomorphism.

    iii. The representation ρ (which can naturally be thought of as a representation of Ñ
         too) can be extended in a unique way to a representation of P1 .

    iv. M1 is perfect; i.e. [M1 , M1 ] = M1 .

     v. P1 is a normal subgroup of p̃−1 (P ).

5.2. Mackey analysis. In this section we assume that the notation is the same as in
section 5.1. We also assume (without loss of generality) that
(5.1) ⋄ G is equal to the extension G̃ of Proposition 5.1.1 and [G, G] is dense in G.
Note that if [G, G] is dense in G, then from [Tor, §8.11] it follows that in fact [G, G] = G.
The assumption [G, G] = G is not a crucial one. This is because one can always find a
closed finite-index subgroup G1 of G such that G1 is perfect and G = G1 · Z(G), and once
a representation π of G is understood on G1 , It is easy to describe it as a representation
of G.

  Assume condition (5.1) holds. Let P1 ⊂ G be the subgroup given in the statement of
Proposition 5.1.1. Then we can write P1 = M1 · N, where M1 is defined in Proposition
5.1.1 and N ≈ Ñ is the unipotent radical of the Heisenberg parabolic P of G which
appears in parts ii and iii of Proposition 5.1.1.

  Let π be a unitary representation of G, without nonzero G-invariant vectors. Consider
the restriction of π to P . Recall that Z(N) means the center of N. By Howe-Moore
theorem [HM], π does not have a nonzero Z(N)-invariant vector either. Therefore in
the direct integral decomposition of π as a representation of N, the spectral measure is
supported on N̂◦ (see the notation introduced at the end of section 2.2).

   Elements of P1 commute with elements of Z(N). Therefore under the coadjoint action
of P on the unitary characters of Z(N), P1 lies within stabP (χ), the stabilizer (inside P )
of any nontrivial additive unitary character χ of Z(N). In fact all these stabilizers are
identical groups. We denote this common stabilizer group by J.

  The action of P on Z(N) (and also on its unitary characters) has only a finite number of
orbits. Consequently, since π has no nonzero G-invariant vectors, by elementary Mackey
theory (see Theorems 3.11 and 3.12 of [Mac1]) the restriction of π to P can be expressed
as a finite direct sum                    M
                                    π|P =     IndPJ σi
                                             i
where each σi is a representation of J which, when restricted to N, is a direct integral of
representations isomorphic to the representation ρi of N (defined in section 2.2) with some
central character χi . However, each ρi extends in exactly one way to a representation
of P1 . We still denote this extension by ρi . Again by Mackey theory we can write the
restriction of σi to P1 as
                                      σi|P1 = νi ⊗ ρi
where νi is indeed a representation of M1 extended trivially on N to P1 . Therefore we
have proved the following result.
Lemma 5.2.1. Let G, P, L and N be as in the beginning of section 5.1 so that G satisfies
condition (5.1). Let π be a unitary representation of G without a nonzero G-invariant
vector. Then π can be written as a finite direct sum
                                          M

where each σi is a representation of J such that
(5.3)                                     σi|P1 = νi ⊗ ρi
and νi factors to a representation of M1 . (In other words, νi is trivial on N.)
   Recall the construction of the H-tower subgroup U = NΓ (see (3.4)). In the notation
of (3.5) we have H 1 = N. The quotient group U2 = NΓ /N is identical to the H-tower
subgroup which is constructed for M. By Proposition 5.1.1, the latter H-tower group
should lie within M1 .
Lemma 5.2.2. Let ρ be the extension to P1 of the irreducible representation of N (which
is also denoted by ρ) with an arbitrary nontrivial central character χ (see section 2.2).
Let NΓ be as in (3.4). Then the restriction of the representation ρ to NΓ is supported on
rankable representations of NΓ of rank one.
Proof. The uniqueness of extension of ρ to P1 implies that on M1 , this extension should
be identical to the extension obtained by restriction of extension of ρ to the metaplectic
group acting on N/Z(N). Therefore the lemma follows from Definition 4.1.1.
                                                                                        
Notation. Let K be an arbitrary (abstract) group and let K ′ be a subgroup of K. Let
σ be a representation of K ′ on a vector space H. Let a ∈ K. Then by σ a we mean a
representation of the subgroup Ka′ = aK ′ a−1 on H defined as follows:
(5.4)                       for every x ∈ Ka′ , σ a (x) = σ(a−1 xa).
In particular, if K ′ = K, then σ a is a representation of K.

  At this point we recall Mackey’s subgroup theorem. We will use it in sections 5.4
and 5.5. Giving a precise statement would require some definitions and would distract
us from the main point of this paper. Therefore, for a detailed discussion we refer the
reader to [Mac1, Theorem 3.5] or [Mac2, Theorem 12.1].
Theorem 5.2.3. (Mackey’s Subgroup Theorem) Let K be a locally compact group and
let K ′ , K ′′ be its closed subgroups. Assume that K, K ′ , K ′′ are “nice” (see the above refer-
ences for details). Let σ be an irreducible representation of K ′ . Then the representation
                                                     K
                                          ResK
                                             K ′′ IndK ′ σ

has a direct integral decomposition supported on representations τv , v ∈ K, where
                                              ′′        K′
                                  τv = IndK                       v
                                          K ′′ ∩Kv′ ResK ′′ ∩Kv′ σ .

Here
                                          Kv′ = vK ′ v −1
and σ v is defined as in (5.4).
  The following elementary lemma, which essentially follows from Mackey theory too,
will help us in sections 5.4 and 5.5
Lemma 5.2.4. Let K ′ ⊂ K be two arbitrary locally compact groups such that K ′ is a
closed normal subgroup of K. Let σ be a unitary representation of K which acts on the
Hilbert space H. Suppose
                                 ResKK ′ σ = σ1 ⊕ σ2
20                                      HADI SALMASIAN

where σ1 and σ2 are unitary representations of K ′ such that for any a ∈ K, we have
                                     HomK ′ (σ1a , σ2 ) = {0}.
(Here σ1a is defined as in (5.4) and HomK ′ (σ1a , σ2 ) means the space of K ′ -intertwining
operators from σ1a to σ2 .) For i ∈ {1, 2}, let Hi be the closed σ(K ′ )-invariant subspace
of H which corresponds to the summand σi . Then each Hi is actually invariant under
σ(K).
Proof. Let a ∈ K. Then the linear operator T defined as
                              T : H1 →
                                     7 H
                               T (w) = σ(a)w for all w ∈ H1
is an element of HomK ′ (σ1a , σ). The orthogonal projection P of H onto H2 is an element
of HomK ′ (σ, σ2 ). By the hypothesis of the lemma, one should have P ◦ T = 0. Therefore
σ(a)H1 ⊆ H1 .
                                                                                       

5.3. Statement of the main theorems. We state the main theorems in this section
and prove them in sections 5.4 and 5.5.

  Throughout this section, we assume G, GF and g are as in section 1.2 and g satisfies
condition (3.1). Moreover, we assume NΓ is the H-tower subgroup of G (see equality
(3.4)), described as in (3.5).

Theorem 5.3.1. Let π be a unitary representation of G. Then in the direct integral
decomposition
                                     Z ⊕
                              π|NΓ =     τ dµ(τ )
                                                N̂Γ
the support of the spectral measure µ is inside the subset of rankable representations of
NΓ .
  In the next theorem the subset of rankable representations of rank k of NΓ will be
denoted by N̂Γ (k).
Theorem 5.3.2. Let π be a unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space Hπ . Consider
the direct integral decomposition
                                         Z ⊕
                                  π|NΓ =     τ dµ(τ )
                                                N̂Γ

and let Pµ be the projective measure corresponding to this decomposition. Let N̂Γ (π) be
the support of π in this direct integral decomposition. Set
                 Hπj = Pµ (N̂Γ (j) ∩ N̂Γ (π)) · Hπ     for any 0 ≤ j ≤ ht(NΓ ).
Then for every j such that
                                   j ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., ht(NΓ )},
Hπj    is a G-invariant subspace of Hπ . The direct sum of all these subspaces is equal to
Hπ .

Remark. It is clear that for Pµ (N̂Γ (j) ∩ N̂Γ (π)) to make sense we need to show that
the sets N̂Γ (j) ∩ N̂Γ (π) are indeed Borel subsets of N̂Γ . In fact one can show that the
set of rankable representations of a given rank of an H-tower group U = H 1 · · · H t can
be constructed with a finite number of set-theoretic operations on open and closed sets
of the unitary dual of U. Here is a sketch of the proof. Any rankable representation σ is
a tensor product of the form
                                       ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρt
such that ρ1 , ..., ρrank(σ) are extensions of representations (with nontrivial central char-
acters) of H 1, ..., H rank(σ) respectively, and the rest of the ρj ’s are trivial. The first
requirement imposes open conditions on the subset of rankable representations of a given
rank, whereas the second requirement imposes a closed condition.
Definition 5.3.3. Let π be any unitary representation of G. π is called “pure-rank” if
its restriction to NΓ is a direct integral of rankable representations of a fixed rank. The
common rank of these rankable representations is called the rank of π.
  Although Theorem 5.3.2 is slightly stronger than Corollary 5.3.4 below, we would like
to state it in order to clarify the analogy between our new theory and the older one.
Corollary 5.3.4. Let π be an irreducible representation of G. Then π is pure-rank.
5.4. Proof of Theorem 5.3.1. In this section we prove Theorem 5.3.1. Without loss
of generality we can assume that condition (5.1) holds. Theorem 5.3.1 is proved by in-
duction on ht(NΓ ). Let NΓ be described as in (3.5). By Howe-Moore’s theorem [HM],
when ht(NΓ ) = 1 there is nothing to prove. Now let ht(NΓ ) > 1. Let P, L, M and N be
as in section 5.1. Let P1 , M1 be as in Proposition 5.1.1. The H-tower subgroup which
is associated to M is N2 = NΓ /N and it lies within M1 . But ht(N2 ) = ht(NΓ ) − 1, and
therefore Theorem 5.3.1 holds for M1 .

    Without loss of generality, we can assume π has no nonzero G-fixed vectors. Let
σi ’s be the representations which appear in the decomposition of π using Lemma 5.2.1.
By a straightforward application of Mackey’s subgroup theorem (see Theorem 5.2.3), or
even more directly (with only little difficulty) by writing the definition of the induced
representation IndPJ σi explicitly, one can see that the representation
                                            ResPP1 IndPJ σi
is supported on representations of the form
                                         ResJP1 σix    x∈P
where σix is defined as in (5.4); i.e.
(5.5)                         for any y ∈ J, σix (y) = σi (x−1 yx).
Note that J is a normal subgroup of P because it contains [P, P ].

   By (5.3), ResJP1 σix is unitarily equivalent to νix ⊗ ρxi where νix and ρxi are defined similar
to (5.5). Theorem 5.3.1 follows from Lemma 5.2.2 applied to ρxi , the fact that by induction
hypothesis νix is supported on rankable representations of N2 = NΓ /N, and Definition
4.1.1.

5.5. Proof of Theorem 5.3.2. We will now proceed towards proving Theorem 5.3.2.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that condition (5.1) holds. Let P, L, N and
M be as in section 5.1. Let P1 , M1 be as in Proposition 5.1.1. The main idea behind
the proof is that the Kirillov orbits of representations of different rank have different
dimensions. We will apply some basic Kirillov theory.

  Recall from section 5.3 that G, g, gF are as in section 1.2 and g satisfies condition (3.1).
Let Σ, Σ+ and ΣB be as in section 1.2 too. Let β̃ be the highest root of g (see section
1.2) and β be a simple restricted root such that (β, β̃) = 1. Recall that
(5.6)                                 P{β} = L{β} N{β}
is a standard parabolic subgroup of G associated to {β} (see section 1.2). Let NΓ be the
H-tower subgroup of G and suppose nΓ is its Lie algebra. Let N{β} be as in equation
(5.6) and suppose n{β} is its Lie algebra. We consider nΓ and n{β} as subalgebras of gF .
Recall that for any γ ∈ Σ, (gF )γ denotes the restricted root subspace of gF associated to
γ. Our next aim is to define a subgroup NΓβ of NΓ in case ht(NΓ ) > 1.

     Let LΓ be as in equation (3.4), with Lie algebra lΓ where lΓ ⊂ gF , and
                                 ΣL = {γ ∈ Σ | (gF )γ ⊂ lΓ }.
Define
                                               M
(5.7)                                  nβΓ =          (gF )γ
                                               γ∈SΓ

where
(5.8)                SΓ = {γ ∈ Σ+ | (gF )γ ⊂ nΓ ∩ n{β} and γ − β ∈
                                                                 / ΣL }.
One can see that nβΓ is a Lie subalgebra of gF . To see this, assume γ, γ ′ ∈ SΓ and
γ + γ ′ ∈ Σ+ . Then since both nΓ and n{β} are Lie algebras, (gF )γ+γ ′ ⊂ nΓ ∩ n{β} .
Moreover, if γ + γ ′ − β ∈ ΣL , then either γ ∈ ΣL or γ ′ ∈ ΣL which is a contradiction.
Consequently γ + γ ′ ∈ SΓ .

  The group NΓβ is defined as the subgroup of NΓ ∩ N{β} with Lie algebra nβΓ . (It is
worth mentioning that NΓβ is a proper subgroup of NΓ ∩ N{β} if and only if Γ contains
an element which is not orthogonal to β in Σ.)

Lemma 5.5.1. Let ht(NΓ ) > 1 and L{β} be as in equation (5.6). Let M{β} = [L{β} , L{β} ],
the commutator subgroup of L{β} . Then M{β} normalizes NΓβ .
Proof. It suffices to show that for any γ ∈ SΓ , if γ + β ∈ Σ (respectively γ − β ∈ Σ) then
γ + β ∈ SΓ (respectively γ − β ∈ SΓ ). Note that γ − β cannot be zero.

   Assume γ ∈ SΓ and γ + β ∈ Σ. Since (gF )γ ⊂ n{β} , we have (gF )γ+β ⊂ n{β} too. Simi-
                                / ΣL and (γ +β)−β = γ ∈
larly, since (gF )γ ⊂ nΓ , γ +β ∈                     / ΣL which imply that γ +β ∈ SΓ .

  Next assume γ ∈ SΓ and γ − β ∈ Σ. Note that γ − β ∈ Σ implies γ − β ∈ Σ+ since
γ ∈ Σ+ . Again since (gF )γ ⊂ n{β} , we have (gF )γ−β ∈ n{β} . Moreover, by the definition of

nβΓ , γ − β ∈
            / ΣL and therefore (gF )γ−β ⊂ nΓ . Finally, if (γ − β) − β ∈ ΣL , then γ = 2β + γ1
where γ1 ∈ ΣL . This means that (γ, β̃) = 2, i.e. γ is the highest root. Since any simple
restricted root appears in the highest root with a positive coefficient, it follows that ΣB
consists of β and the elements of Γ. Consequently, there is only one simple restricted
root outside Γ, which implies that ht(NΓ ) = 1, which contradicts our assumption.
                                                                                            

Proposition 5.5.2. Let G be as in Theoreom 5.3.2, NΓ be the H-tower subgroup of G and
ht(NΓ ) > 1. Let NΓβ be defined as in equation (5.7). Then the restriction of a rankable
representation σ of rank k of NΓ to NΓβ is a direct integral of irreducible representations of
NΓβ whose attached coadjoint orbits have the same dimension equal to 2(n1 + · · ·+ nk − c),
where c is the codimension of NΓβ in NΓ , and ni ’s are defined as in Corollary 4.2.3.

Proof. Throughout the proof we assume F = R for simplicity. The proof for other local
fields is essentially similar.

with the ρi ’s as in Definition 4.1.1. It is easy to see that NΓβ ⊃ H 2 · · · H ht(NΓ ) , so when
j > 1 the restriction of ρj to NΓβ is irreducible. It remains to understand the restriction
of ρ1 to NΓβ . The group H 1 ∩ NΓβ is a direct product of a Heisenberg group of dimension
2(n1 − c) + 1 and a c-dimensional abelian group whose Lie algebra corresponds to the
direct sum of restricted root spaces (gR )β̃−γ , such that (γ, β̃) > 0 but γ ∈/ SΓ . To see why
these restricted root spaces form an isotropic subspace of the Heisenberg nilradical of gR ,
suppose β̃ − γ1 , β̃ − γ2 are given such that for any i ∈ {1, 2}, (γi , β̃) > 0 but γi ∈  / SΓ . If
(β̃ −γ1 )+(β̃ −γ2 ) = β̃, then β̃ = γ1 +γ2 . But for any i ∈ {1, 2}, γi = β +γi′ where γi′ ∈ ΣL
or γi′ = 0. Therefore β̃ = 2β+γ1′ +γ2′ , which implies that ΣB consists of β and the elements
of Γ. (See the proof of Lemma 5.5.1.) Consequently ht(NΓ ) = 1, which is a contradiction.

  Let the decomposition of H 1 ∩ NΓβ as a direct product be H β × Rc , where H β is the
2(n1 − c) + 1-dimensional Heisenberg group and Rc is the abelian factor. We will denote
the irreducible representation of H β with central character χ1 by ρβ1 .

The space Hρ of any representation ρ of the Heisenberg group H 1 = Hn1 introduced in
section 2.2 can be written as
             Hρ = L2 (y) = L2 (SpanR {Y1 , . . . , Yc } ⊕ SpanR {Yc+1, . . . , Yn1 }) =
                                                                       Z ⊕

                           L (R )⊗L (SpanR {Yc+1, . . . , Yn1 }) ≈             L2s dµ(s)
                                                                             Rc ∗
where  each L2s                   2                                            c
                   is equal to L (SpanR {Yc+1 , . . . , Yn1 }) on which R acts via the character
          is(x)
χs (x) = e      . In fact L2s is a representation of H β × Rc . Lemma 5.5.3 is proved.        
  Next we show that Rc ⊂ Z(NΓβ ). To see this, take a restricted root space (gR )β̃−γ
which lies inside Rc . It suffices to show that for any γ ′ ∈ SΓ , (β̃ − γ) + γ ′ ∈
                                                                                  / Σ. But we
know that γ = β + γ1 where γ1 ∈ ΣL or γ1 = 0. Therefore (β̃ − γ) + γ ′ = β̃ − β − γ1 + γ ′ .
Consequently, if (β̃ − γ) + γ ′ ∈ Σ, then either γ ′ ∈ ΣL or γ ′ − β = γ1 ∈ ΣL . However,
none of these is possible for γ ′ by the definition of SΓ in (5.8).

   We have shown that Rc ⊂ Z(NΓβ ) and the action of Rc on each L2s is by a distinct
character ψs (see Lemma 5.5.3). Hence the restriction of ρ1 to NΓβ breaks into a direct
integral of a c-parameter family of irreducible representations. Consequently the same
thing happens to any rankable representation
                                          σ = ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk .
By Theorem 2.5.1 of [CG] and Lemma 4.2.2 applied to NΓβ which is a semidirect product
of H β × Rc and N2 , it follows that the projection of the coadjoint orbit Oσ∗ onto the Lie
algebra of NΓβ is foliated by subvarieties of codimension 2c, which are indeed coadjoint
orbits of the constituents of the rankable representations in the restriction of σ to NΓβ .
Proposition 5.5.2 is proved.                                                             
  We will now concentrate on finishing the proof of Theorem 5.3.2. Theorem 5.3.2 is
proved by induction on the height ht(NΓ ) of the H-tower group NΓ . If ht(NΓ ) = 1 then
there is nothing to prove. Let ht(NΓ ) > 1. Then the H-tower subgroup of M1 is equal to
N2 , where
                                       N2 = NΓ /N.
Clearly ht(N2 ) = ht(NΓ ) − 1.

   Without loss of generality we can assume π has no nonzero G-invariant vectors. Con-
sider the decomposition of π given in (5.2). Applying induction hypothesis to M1 , which
contains the H-tower subgroup N2 , we can refine this decomposition by expressing each
νi as a direct sum of its M1 -invariant pure-rank parts (where the rank for a representation
of M1 is naturally defined with respect to N2 ). Conseqently, as a representation of M1 ,
                                   νi = νi,0 ⊕ νi,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ νi,ht(N2 ) .
Here νi,j denotes the part of νi supported on rankable representations of N2 of rank j.
(Note that some of the νi,j ’s may be trivial, but this fact does not affect our proof.)
Therefore we have
                        σi|P1 = (νi,0 ⊗ ρi ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (νi,ht(N2 ) ⊗ ρi ).
Let H be the Hilbert space of the representation σi . For any j ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., ht(N2 )}, let
Hj be the subspace of H which corresponds to νi,j ⊗ ρi . Our next task is to prove that
                   A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                                25

each Hj is in fact invariant under σi (J). (See Lemma 5.2.1.) This follows from Lemma
5.2.4 once we prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.5.4. Let η = νi,j ⊗ ρi and η ′ = νi,j ′ ⊗ ρi where j 6= j ′ . Let a ∈ J. Then
                                      HomP1 (η a , η ′ ) = {0}
where η a is a representation of P1 defined on Hj defined as in (5.4); i.e.
                             η a (x) = η(a−1 xa)     for all x ∈ P1 .
Proof. We actually prove more; i.e. that
(5.9)                         HomNΓ (ResPN1Γ η a , ResPN1Γ η ′ ) = {0}.
We claim that ResPN1Γ η a is a direct integral supported on rankable representations of NΓ
of rank j + 1. The claim implies (5.9) because if j 6= j ′ , then it implies that ResPN1Γ η a and
ResPN1Γ η ′ are supported on disjoint subsets of N̂Γ . We prove this claim below.

  By Lemma 5.2.2, ρai is supported on rankable representations of NΓ of rank one. Next
              a
we show that νi,j is supported on rankable representations of N2 = NΓ /N of rank j.

   As we know, G is a central extension of GF . Suppose this extension is represented as
in (1.1).

   First let a ∈ N. Then a ∈ NΓ and consequently ResPN1Γ η a is unitarily equivalent to
ResPN1Γ η. Since J ⊂ P and any element of P is a product of an element of N and an
element of p−1 (LF ), it follows that it suffices to assume that p(a) ∈ LF .

   It follows from p(a) ∈ LF that p(a)MF p(a−1 ) = MF . The group p(PΓ ) is the F-points
of the F-parabolic PΓ′ of G. Now Pm = PΓ′ ∩ M is an F-parabolic of M. Since
p(a) ∈ LF , p(a)Pm p(a−1 ) is another F-parabolic of M, and therefore by [Bor, Theorem
20.9] these two parabolics are conjugate under an element p(b) of MF where b ∈ M1 (re-
call from Proposition 5.1.1 that p(M1 ) ⊇ MF ). This means that p(ba)Pm p(ba)−1 = Pm .
If Um is the unipotent radical of Pm , then p(ba)Um p(ba)−1 = Um , which implies that
baN2 a−1 b−1 = N2 .

   Let c = ba. Then c ∈ P . Let n2 ⊂ nΓ be the Lie algebra of N2 . Consider Ad∗ (c) as a
linear map from the dual of the Lie algebra of P to itself. Obviously Ad∗ (c)(n∗2 ) = n∗2 .
Let τ be an irreducible unitary representation of N2 and let Oτ∗ be the coadjoint orbit
associated to τ . Then the coadjoint orbit associated to τ c is Ad∗ (c)(Oτ∗ ). This fact fol-
lows for instance from [Du, III 11]. A short proof of this fact can be obtained by an
adaptation of the proof of Lemma 5.5.6.

  For simplicity let ν = νi,j for fixed i, j. The representation ResM

  Let ν a , ν b , ν c be representations of M1 defined as in (5.4). (Note that aM1 a−1 = M1
because P1 is normal in p−1 (PF ).) Since b ∈ M1 , any representation θ of M1 is obviously
unitarily equivalent to θb . Therefore ν c is unitarily equivalent to ν a . Since the action of
Ad∗ (c) on n∗2 is linear, it does not change the dimension of coadjoint orbits, and therefore
ResM 1 c
   N2 ν is supported on unitary representations of N2 whose associated coadjoint orbits
have dimension n2 + · · · + nj+1 .

   Since ν c is a unitary representation of M1 , by Theorem 5.3.1 all representations in
the support of its restriction to N2 should be rankable. Therefore ResM     1 c
                                                                          N2 ν is supported
on rankable representations of N2 of rank j. Now ν is unitarily equivalent to ν c as a
                                                       a

representation of M1 , and hence as a representation of N2 . Therefore ν a is also supported
on rankable representations of N2 of rank j. Definition 4.1.1 completes the proof of our
claim. The proof of Lemma 5.5.4 is complete.
                                                                                          
  As mentioned before, Lemma 5.5.4 implies that each of the subspaces Hj (which cor-
responds to the representation νi,j ⊗ ρi of P1 ) is invariant under σi (J).
Lemma 5.5.5. There is a P -invariant direct sum decomposition of π such as
                                  π|P = π1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ πht(NΓ )
where each πi is of pure NΓ -rank i.

Proof. The invariance of the spaces Hj under σi (J) means that one can actually decom-
pose σi as a direct sum
                              σi = σi,1 ⊕ σi,2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ σi,ht(NΓ )
such that each σi,j is a representation of J and
                                     σi,j |P1 = νi,j−1 ⊗ ρi .
Now an application of Mackey’s subgroup theorem (see Theorem 5.2.3) immediately
implies that the representation
                                     ResPNΓ IndPJ σi,j
is supported on rankable representations of NΓ of rank j. (See the argument of Theorem
5.3.1 and Lemma 5.5.4.) Lemma 5.5.5 is proved.                                       
   Recall from Lemma 5.5.1 that the group NΓβ is normalized by M{β} . A version of the
following lemma was mentioned in the proof of Lemma 5.5.4.
Lemma 5.5.6. Let τ be a unitary representation of NΓβ and let g ∈ M{β} . Let τ g be
defined as in (5.4). Then the coadjoint orbits associated to τ and τ g (in the sense of
Kirillov’s orbital theory) have the same dimension.
Proof. The proof follows immediately from the fact that the coadjoint orbit attached to
τ g is Ad∗ (g)(O∗ ), which follows from [Du, III 11]. We would like to give a short proof of
this fact for the reader’s convenience. Let nβΓ be the Lie algebra of NΓβ . Fix an additive
character χ of F as done in [Mo1, §4]. (When F = R or C, χ(t) = eiRe(t) where Re(t)
means the real part of t, and when F is p-adic, χ will be an unramified character given by
Tate.) Let the coajoint orbit associated to τ be Oτ∗ ⊂ nβΓ . By Kirillov’s orbital theory we
know that τ is constructed as follows. One chooses an arbitrary element λ ∈ Oτ∗ and a
                   A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                              27

maximal subalgebra q of nβΓ subordinate to λ, which exponentiates to a closed subgroup
Q of NΓβ . Then
                                            Nβ
                                  τ = IndQΓ (χ ◦ λ ◦ log).
For any g ∈ M{β} , let (χ ◦ λ ◦ log)g be defined as in (5.4). Then
                      Nβ                             Nβ       ∗
             τ g = IndgQg
                       Γ                  g
                          −1 (χ ◦ λ ◦ log) = IndgQg −1 (χ ◦ Ad (g)(λ) ◦ log).
                                                 Γ



Since Ad(g)(q) is a maximal subalgebra subordinate to Ad∗ (g)(λ), the coadjoint orbit
attached to τ g is
                                      Ad∗ (g)(O∗ ).
Since the action of Ad∗ (g) is linear on nβΓ , it does not change the dimension of the
coadjoint orbit.                                                                    
  To prove Theorem 5.3.2, we show that each of the components πi given in Lemma
5.5.5 is G-invariant as well. To this end, we first prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.5.7. The P -invariant decomposition in Lemma 5.5.5 is preserved by the action
of M{β} , where
                                 M{β} = [L{β} , L{β} ]
and L{β} is the Levi component of the standard parabolic P{β} with β as in Proposition
5.5.2.
Proof. For any 1 ≤ j ≤ ht(NΓ ), the representation
                                           ResPN β πj
                                                 Γ

is a direct integral of representations which correspond to coadjoint orbits of dimension
2(n1 + · · · + nj − c). However, n1 , ..., nht(NΓ ) > 0. Therefore, if we define πja (for any
a ∈ M{β} ) as in (5.4), then Lemma 5.5.6 implies that for any j ′ 6= j, the dimension of
the coadjoint orbits associated to the irreducible representations of NΓβ in the support of
ResPNΓ πja is different from the dimension of the coadjoint orbits assoiated to the irreducible
representations of NΓβ in the support of ResPNΓ πj ′ . This means that
                            HomN β (ResPN β πja , ResPN β πj ′ ) = {0}.
                                   Γ        Γ             Γ

Now we apply Lemma 5.2.4 with K = [P{β} , P{β} ], K ′ = NΓβ , σ = π, σ1 = πi and
                                       M
                                 σ2 =       πi .
                                                 i6=j

It follows that each πj is invariant under the action of M{β} . Lemma 5.5.7 is proved.
                                                                                             
   To finish the proof of Theorem 5.3.2, we note that the parabolic subgroup P in G is
maximal, therefore the group generated by M{β} and P will be equal to G. (This follows
from the Bruhat-Tits decomposition.) The decomposition of π given in Lemma 5.5.5 is
preserved by both P and M{β} , and hence by the group generated by them. Therefore
the decomposition of Lemma 5.5.5 is G-invariant.

Remark. Let G be as in Theorem 5.3.1, such that the central extension identifying
G is as in (1.1). Let NΓ be the H-tower subgroup of the group G. Let π be a unitary
28                                     HADI SALMASIAN

representation of G of pure rank k, where k ≤ ht(NΓ ). Consider the subgroup Ak of
G defined as follows. Ak = p−1 (A′F ), where A′ is an F-torus inside the maximal split
F-torus A whose Lie algebra is spanned by the coroots Hβ̃1 , ..., Hβ̃k . Let τ be a rankable
representation of NΓ of rank k. The stabilizer Sτ of τ inside Ak is a finite subgroup of
Ak . Moreover, under the action of Ak there are only a finite number of orbits of rankable
representations of rank k. By Mackey theory, the restriction of π to Ak ⋉ NΓ is a direct
integral of representations of the form
(5.10)                                    IndA k ⋉NΓ
                                             Sτ ⋉NΓ στ

where στ is irreducible and στ |NΓ = nτ τ for some nτ ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., ∞}. Moreover, by
                                                               Sτ ⋉NΓ
Frobenius reciprocity, στ will be a subrepresentation of IndN    Γ
                                                                      τ . Since Sτ is a finite
group, there are only a finite number of possibilities for στ . Since the number of orbits
(and hence stabilizers) of rankable representations of rank k under the action of Ak is
finite, the number of representations of the form (5.10) is finite as well. This implies the
following result.
Proposition 5.5.8. Let π be a unitary representation of G of pure rank k. Then there
exists a finite family {τ1 , ..., τt } of irreducible representations of Ak ⋉ NΓ , independent of
π, such that
                                      π|Ak ⋉NΓ = n1 τ1 + · · · + nt τt
where ni ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., ∞} for each i.

                          6. Relation with the old theory
6.1. Outline of the old theory. In this section we show how the notion of rank defined
in the past sections relates to the existing theory for classical groups. To this end, we
show that for the real forms of classical groups, the two notions of rank (the one defined
in [Li1] and the one defined in Definition 5.3.3) are equivalent. Here we give a brief out-
line of the old theory. In classical cases, rank of a representation of the real semisimple
group G is defined in terms of its restriction to the centers of nilradicals of maximal
parabolic subgroups. One can characterize each of these parabolics with a node in the
Dynkin diagram of the restricted root system in a natural way. It turns out that there is
a (not necessarily unique) standard parabolic which provides the most refined informa-
tion about the rank. We will devote this section to exhibiting the coincidence of the two
notions of rank on this parabolic. Really the main idea is some slight modification of
the fact that the nilradical of the rank parabolic subalgebra contains a maximal isotropic
subspace of each of the Heisenberg algebras in the H-tower NΓ . Our presentation of the
results follows the notation of older literature [Hw1], [Li1], [Sca].

   The notation used in this section is chosen independent of other sections in order to
simplify matters and be more coherent with older works. For simplicity we only consider
the case F = R. The general case is essentially the same and will only be more technical.
It is more convenient to consider classical groups of different types (in the sense of [Hw5])
separately. Here we quickly review the definition of classical groups of types I and II over
a local field, but later we will retain our assumption that F = R.

  Let F be a local field, D a division algebra over F with an involution, and V a left vector
space over D of dimension n. A classical group G is said to be of type II if G = GLD (V ).
                     A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                                 29

From now on, by (·, ·) we mean a Hermitian or skew-Hermitian sesquilinear form (·, ·) on
V . A classical group G of type I is the connected component of identity of the stabilizer
subgroup of (·, ·) inside GLD (V ). The real groups of type I which are of our interest
here, i.e. those which satisfy the assumptions of Proposition 3.1.1, correspond to the
cases where F = R and D = R, C or H with their usual involutions.


6.2. Groups of type I. A typical maximal parabolic of these groups can be described
as follows. Take a maximal polarization inside V , i.e. a maximal set of vectors
                                        {e1 , . . . , er , e∗1 , . . . , e∗r }
in V which satisfy
                                    (ei , ej ) = (e∗i , e∗j ) = 0
                                          (ei , e∗j ) = δi,j .
In fact r is equal to the split rank of G. For any k let
                    Xk = SpanD {e1 , . . . , ek } ,            Xk∗ = SpanD {e∗1 , . . . , e∗k }
and define Vk to be Xk ⊕Xk∗ . Let Pk be the subgroup of G that consists of elements which
leave the subspace Xk∗ invariant. Pk is a parabolic subgroup and the Levi decomposition
of Pk looks like
(6.1)                                 Pk = GLD (Xk∗ )G(Vk⊥ )Nk
where by G(Vk⊥ ) we mean the stabilizer of (·, ·) as a form on Vk⊥ . Here Nk is the unipo-
tent radical of Pk .

  Pr is the parabolic which provides the most refined information about the rank (in the
sense of [Hw1],[Li1]).
Definition 6.2.1. Let r be the split rank of G. The parabolic Pr or its Lie algebra are
called the rank parabolic.

   The unipotent radical Nk is a two-step nilpotent simply connected Lie group and there-
fore it can be identified with its Lie algebra via the exponential map. From now on, we
think of any Nk through this identification, and although slightly ambiguous, we use the
same notation for its Lie subgroups and their Lie algebras. This is done in order to avoid
complicated notation and to keep the presentation as close to the style used in the papers
of Howe and Li. We will make it clear whether or not we are using a Lie group or a Lie
algerba wherever necessary.

  As in [Li1], we have the following exact sequence of Lie algebras:
                         0 −→ ZNk −→ Nk −→ HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ ) −→ 0
where ZNk is the center of Nk . ZNk is isomorphic to
                                             Hominv      ∗
                                                D (Xk , Xk )

where Hominv      ∗                                                  ∗
         D (Xk , Xk ) is the F-subspace of elements T of HomD (Xk , Xk ) satisfying

                         ∀i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, (T ei , ej ) + (ei , T ej ) = 0.
30                                         HADI SALMASIAN

Thus as an F−vector space, the Lie algebra Nk can be expressed as
(6.2)                      Nk = HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ ) ⊕ Hominv      ∗
                                                       D (Xk , Xk ).

     The isomorphism of HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ ) into the Lie algebra Nk can be depicted as
(6.3)                        ˜: HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ ) 7→ HomD (V, V )

                                                    T 7→ T̃
     where T̃ is defined as follows:

                                       T̃ v = T v    for   v ∈ Vk⊥
                                        T̃ v = 0     for   v ∈ Xk∗
                                    T̃ v = T t v     for   v ∈ Xk .
Here T t ∈ HomD (Xk , Vk⊥ ) is defined uniquely by
                      ∀ v ∈ Vk⊥ , x ∈ Xk            (T v, x) + (v, T t x) = 0.
  It turns out that the Heisenberg parabolic P of G is Pk1 , where k1 = 2 for G = SOp,q
and k1 = 1 for all other classical cases under consideration. Let P = LN be the Levi
decomposition of P . Let M be the appropriate simple isotropic factor of [L, L]; i.e. we
drop the redundant factor of [L, L] which, in (6.1), corresponds to GLD (Xk∗1 ). Let m be
the Lie algebra of M. For any k define
                      Yk = Span{ek , . . . , er } ,     Yk∗ = Span{e∗k , . . . , e∗r }.
The center of the nilradical of the rank parabolic of m is identical to
                                        Hominv           ∗
                                           D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ).

The Lie algebra Hominv             ∗
                     D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) acts on the Lie algebra Nk1 through the adjoint
action of m. By Theorem 3.1.1 this action will be trivial on ZNk1 . The following simple
lemma describes this action more explicitly.
Lemma 6.2.2. Let X ∈ Hominv              ∗                     ⊥   ∗
                             D (Yk+1 , Yk+1 ). Let Y ∈ HomD (Vk , Xk ). Then the adjoint
action of m on n = Nk is described as
                                          adX (Ỹ ) = −(Y˜X)
where Y˜X is defined as in (6.3).
Remark. Note that we think of −Y X as an element of HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ ) which is zero on
Vr⊥ and Yk+1
          ∗
             .

   The restriction of (·, ·) to Vr⊥ is a definite form. Without loss of generality, we may
assume that the form is positive definite. Let {f1 , . . . , fn−2r } be an orthonormal basis
for Vc = Vr⊥ ; consequently Vc = SpanD {f1 , . . . , fn−2r }. One can see that HomD (Vk⊥ , Xk∗ )
is equal to
(6.4)               HomD (Yk+1 , Xk∗) ⊕ HomD (Yk+1
                                                ∗
                                                   , Xk∗ ) ⊕ HomD (Vc , Xk∗ ).
We consider the direct sum decomposition (6.4) inside Nk (see (6.2) ) We observe that:
                   A NOTION OF RANK FOR UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                            31

Lemma 6.2.3. In the direct sum decomposition (6.4), the third summand commutes
with the first two summands, and the adjoint action of Hominv         ∗
                                                          D (Yk+1 , Yk+1 ) on the third
summand is trivial.


  Now take k = k1 . Then the direct sum
(6.5)          HomD (Yk1+1 , Xk∗1 ) ⊕ HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 ) ⊕ Hominv       ∗
                                                                  D (Xk1 , Xk1 )

is a Lie subalgebra of Nk1 , and also a Heisenberg algebra with a polarization given
by the first two summands in (6.5). We denote the Lie algebra in (6.5) (and also its
corresponding Lie group) by N k1 . The Lie bracket when restricted to the polarization is
described as follows.
Lemma 6.2.4. Let X ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk∗1 ) and Y ∈ HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 ). Then [X̃, Ỹ ] is
an element of Hominv       ∗
                 D (Xk1 , Xk1 ) given by

                                     [X̃, Ỹ ] = XY t − Y X t
where X t ∈ HomD (Xk1 , Yk∗1 +1 ) and Y t ∈ HomD (Xk1 , Yk1 +1 ) are uniquely determined as
follows
                  ∀ i ≤ k1 and ∀ j > k1 , (X t ei , ej ) + (ei , Xej ) = 0
                     ∀ i ≤ k1 and ∀ j > k1 , (Y t ei , e∗j ) + (ei , Y e∗j ) = 0.

Proof. Follows immediately from [X̃, Ỹ ] = X̃ Ỹ − Ỹ X̃ where X̃ and Ỹ are defined as in
(6.3).                                                                                   
   The adjoint action of Hominv            ∗
                             D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) on N k1 is given by Lemma 6.2.2. This ac-
tion normalizes N k1 and takes HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 ) to HomD (Yk1+1 , Xk∗1 ).

  At this point we come back to nilpotent groups and their representations. Consider
an irreducible representation ρ1 of the Heisenberg group Nk1 with (nontrivial) central
character χ1 . From the orthogonal decomposition obtained in (6.5) it follows that the
restriction of ρ1 to the group N k1 decomposes into a direct integral of representations of
this latter Heisenberg group with the same central character. We study the restriction
of a rankable representation of rank one of the H-tower unipotent radical of G to its
subgroup
                               N k1 ⋊ Hominv            ∗
                                          D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ).
This restriction is a direct integral of representations of the latter group obtained by
extending the irreducible representation of N k1 with central character χ1 to N k1 ⋊
Hominv             ∗
     D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) as suggested by Proposition 2.3.1. This is because Lemma 6.2.3
implies that as subspaces of Nk1 ,
                       [Hominv           ∗                   ∗
                           D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ), HomD (Vc , Xk1 )] = {0}

and the Weil representation is functorial. (See (1.15) of [Hw1] for a precise meaning of
functoriality.)

  Since Hominv         ∗
             D (Y1 , Y1 ) is an abelian Lie group, any unitary representation of this group
can be described as a direct integral of unitary characters. Hominv          ∗
                                                                   D (Y1 , Y1 ) is isomorphic
32                                        HADI SALMASIAN

to some Rp ; so its group of unitary characters can be naturally identified to Hominv  ∗
                                                                                  D (Y1 , Y1 )
via the F-bilinear form
(6.6)                                   β(A, B) = tr(AB).
Definition 6.2.5. The rank of a character of Hominv          ∗
                                                   D (Y1 , Y1 ) is the F-rank of the element
       inv ∗
in HomD (Y1 , Y1 ) which corresponds to it via the bilinear form in (6.6).
Definition 6.2.6. (See [Hw1],[Li1]) Let π be a unitary representation of G. π is said to
have rank k if and only if π|Hominv     ∗ decomposes into a direct integral of characters of
                                D (Y1 ,Y1 )
rank equal to k.
     The following proposition is a key result of this section.
Proposition 6.2.7. The restriction of a rankable representation of rank one to
                                          Hominv       ∗
                                             D (Y1 , Y1 )

is supported on characters whose rank is equal to k1 .
Proof. The polarization for the group N k1 has the structure of a D-vector space. There-
fore, similar to (2.5), we can realize the representation ρ1 of N k1 on
                                      L2 (HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 ))
and then extend it to Hominv            ∗
                          D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ). In Lemma 6.2.8 below, we denote elements
of the Lie algebras by X, Y, ... and the corresponding elements in the Lie groups by
eX , eY ,....
Lemma 6.2.8. The action of the extension of ρ1 is described as below.
  (a) For any X ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk∗1 ), Y ∈ HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 )
                                 (ρ1 (eX )f )(Y ) = χ1 (e[Y,X] )f (Y )
      (b) For any X ∈ Hominv           ∗                   ∗       ∗
                         D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ), Y ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk1 )
                                                         1
                               (ρ1 (eX )f )(Y ) = χ1 (e 2 [Y,Y X] )f (Y )
      (c) For any X ∈ Hominv       ∗                 ∗       ∗
                         D (Xk1 , Xk1 ), Y ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk1 )

                                  (ρ1 (eX )f )(Y ) = χ1 (eX )f (Y ).
Proof. This is an almost immediate consequence of the Schrödinger model for the real-
ization of Weil representation. See [Hw6].                                          
     Let X ∈ Hominv           ∗                      ∗       ∗
                D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) and Y ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk1 ). For all i ≤ k1 and j > k1 ,

                          (ej , (Y X)t ei ) = −(Y Xej , ei ) = (Xej , Y t ei )
                             = −(ej , XY t ei ) = (ej , −XY t ei )
which implies that (Y X)t = −XY t . Thus the equation in part (b) of Lemma 6.2.8 can
be simplified as
                                                         t
                            (ρ1 (X)f )(Y ) = χ1 (e−Y XY )f (Y ).
  We would like to have a single formula instead of parts (a), (b) and (c) of Lemma
6.2.8. To this end, we define the linear operator S = S(Y ) such that
                                           S : Y1∗ 7→ Xk∗1

                                      Se∗i = e∗i if i ≤ k1
                                     Se∗i = Y e∗i if i > k1 .
We have the following lemma.
Lemma 6.2.9. Let X ∈ Hominv       ∗
                        D (Y1 , Y1 ). Let f be a function such that

                                  f ∈ L2 (HomD (Yk∗1 +1 , Xk∗1 )).
Then
                                                            t
                             ρ1 (eX )f (Y ) = χ1 (e−SXS )f (Y )
where S t is defined as in Lemma 6.2.4.
Proof. Applying (ei , Se∗j ) + (S t ei , e∗j ) = 0, one can see that for any i ≤ k1
                                       S t ei = −ei + Y t ei
and thus for any X ∈ HomD (Yk1 +1 , Xk∗1 )
                            −SXS t ei = −S X̃(−ei + Y t ei ) =
                                (−S)(−X t )ei − SXY t ei =
                                 Y X t ei − XY t ei = [Y, X]ei
which proves −SXS t = [Y, X].

  For any X ∈ Hominv           ∗
                 D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) we have

                  −SXS t ei = −S X̃(−ei + Y t ei ) = −SXY t ei = −Y XY t ei
which proves −SXS t = −Y XY t .

  Finally, when X ∈ Hominv       ∗
                       D (Xk1 , Xk1 )

                        −SXS t ei = −SX(−ei + Y t ei ) = SXei = Xei
which proves −SXS t = X. This completes the proof.                                     
   To complete the proof of Proposition 6.2.7, note that via the identification described
                                          t
in (6.6), the character χ(eX ) = χ1 (e−S XS ) corresponds to an element
                                  a
(6.7)                           − S tV S         a ∈ iR − {0}
                                 k1
where
                                       V : Xk∗1 7→ Xk1
is defined as
                      V e∗l = (−1)l+1 e∗k1 −l+1 for any 1 ≤ l ≤ k1 .
It is easy to see that (6.7) is an element of Hominv  ∗
                                                 D (Y1 , Y1 ) of rank k1 , even when its
domain is restricted to Xk1 .                                                         
  The following theorem shows that in groups of type I, the two notions of rank are
essentially the same.
Theorem 6.2.10. Let π be an irreducible representation of a classical group G of type
I. Let NΓ be the H-tower subgroup of G (see (3.4)).
34                                     HADI SALMASIAN

       • Assume that the rank of π in the sense of Definition 6.2.6 is less than ht(NΓ )×k1 .
         Then π has rank k in the sense of Definition 5.3.3 if and only if π has rank kk1
         in the sense of Definition 6.2.6.
       • If the rank of π in the sense of Definition 5.3.3 is equal to ht(NΓ ), then rank of
         π in the sense of Definition 6.2.6 is ht(NΓ ) × k1 or higher.
Proof. Since π is supported on rankable representations, the only thing we have to show
is that a rankable representation of rank k (in the sense of Definition 4.1.1), when re-
stricted to Hominv   ∗
                D (Y1 , Y1 ), decomposes as a direct integral of characters of rank kk1 . By
Proposition 6.2.7, this is true when k = 1.

     Next consider a rankable representation ρ of rank k > 1, say
                                       ρ = ρ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk .
Elementary properties of tensor product imply that the restriction of ρ to Hominv       ∗
                                                                              D (Y1 , Y1 )
is a direct integral of characters of the form
                                             φ1 · φ2
where the characters φ1 and φ2 are constituents of the direct integral decomposition of ρ1
and ρ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk , when restricted to Hominv        ∗
                                             D (Y1 , Y1 ), respectively. But if φi (i ∈ {1, 2})
                            inv  ∗
corresponds to Ai ∈ HomD (Y1 , Y1 ) via (6.6), then φ1 · φ2 corresponds to A1 + A2 . Since
ρ2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρk and therefore any possible φ2 is a trivial representation when restricted
to Nk1 , any possible A2 is really an element of Hominv        ∗
                                                          D (Yk1 +1 , Yk1 +1 ) which is extended
trivially on Xk1 to Y1∗ . However, at the end of the proof of Proposition 6.2.7 it was shown
that any such character φ1 corresponds to some element of Hominv                ∗
                                                                          D (Y1 , Y1 ) which is of
rank k1 even when its domain is restricted to Xk∗1 . It is now easy to show that we have
                  rank(A1 + A2 ) = rank(A1 ) + rank(A2 ) = k1 + rank(A2 ).
An induction on k completes the proof.                                                         
Example. Let G = SO(6, 6). Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of G. Then
the rank of π in the sense of Definition 6.2.6 can be 0, 2, 4 or 6. The rank of π in the sense
of Definition 5.3.3 can be 0, 1 or 2. The following chart shows how the ranks correspond
to each other:
                              Definition 6.2.6 Definition 5.3.3
                                             0 0
                                             2 1
                                             4 2
                                             6 2
   Now let G = SO(5, 11). Then we have a similar chart for the rank of π.
                              Definition 6.2.6 Definition 5.3.3
                                             0 0
                                             2 1
                                             4 2
Therefore the correspondence of ranks may or may not be one to one. It is an easy
exercise to determine in which cases the correspondence is actually one to one.

6.3. SLl+1 (R). Let G = SLl+1 (R), the group of linear transformations on the l + 1-
dimensional vector space V with a fixed basis
                                         {e1 , . . . , el+1 }.
Set r = ⌊ l+1
           2
              ⌋. For any k let Pk be the maximal parabolic of G which is represented by
matrices of the form                              
                                          A B
                                          0 C
where
               A ∈ GLk (R) , C ∈ GLl+1−k (R) , and B ∈ Mk×(l+1−k) (R).
Therefore
                           Pk = S(GLk (R) × GLl+1−k (R)) · Nk
where
                  Nk = Hom(Span({ek+1 , . . . , el+1 }), Span({e1 , . . . , ek })).
The parabolic of G which gives the most refined rank is Pr , and henceforth we focus our
attention to Pr . Let
               Xk = Span({e2 , . . . , ek })      ,        Yk = Span({ek , . . . , el }).
The Heisenberg parabolic subgroup of G is P1 ∩ Pl , and a polarization of the Lie algebra
of its unipotent radical N is a direct sum of
                             Hom(Xr , Re1 ) ⊕ Hom(Rel+1 , Yr+1 )
and
                          Hom(Yr+1 , Re1 ) ⊕ Hom(Rel+1 , Xr ).
The second summand lies inside the nilradical of the Lie algebra of Pr . Its center is
isomorphic to
                                   Hom(Rel+1 , Re1 ).
As before we are interested in description of the restriction of a representation ρ1 of N
to
                   Hom(Span({er+1 , . . . , el+1 }), Span({e1 , . . . , er })).
We identify the dual of
                     Hom(Span({er+1 , . . . , el+1 }), Span({e1 , . . . , er }))
with itself via the bilinear form
                                      β(X, Y ) = tr(X t Y ).
The rank of a unitary character of
                     Hom(Span({er+1 , . . . , el+1 }), Span({e1 , . . . , er }))
is defined to be the rank of the linear transformation which corresponds to it via the
bilinear form β.

  We write any
                        Y ∈ Hom(Xr , Re1 ) ⊕ Hom(Rel+1 , Yr+1 )
naturally as Y = Y1 ⊕ Y2 . Define
                            Y1+ ∈ Hom(Span({e1 , . . . , er }), Re1 )
36                                         HADI SALMASIAN

by
                                  Y1+ e1 = e1
                                  Y1+ ej = Y1 ej        for any j > 1.
Similarly,
                            Y2+ ∈ Hom(Rel+1 , Span({er+1 , . . . , el+1 }))
is defined to be
                                     Y2+ el+1 = −Y2 el+1 + el+1 .
We can prove the following version of Lemma 6.2.9.
Lemma 6.3.1. Let ρ1 be a representation of N with central character χ1 realized on
                          H = L2 (Hom(Xr , Re1 ) ⊕ Hom(Rel+1 , Yr+1 ))
as in section 2.1.
For any
                     X ∈ Hom(Span({er+1 , . . . , el+1 }), Span({e1 , . . . , er })),
we have
                                                             +
                                                                 XY2+
                                  ρ1 (X)f (Y ) = χ1 (eY1                )f (Y ).
Proof. We will write Y as Y1 ⊕ Y2 according to the polarization given in the statement
of the lemma. Based on the Schrödinger model, if X ∈ Hom(Yr+1, Xr ), then the action
of X on the function f at a point Y is multiplication by the character
                                           1
                                    χ1 (e− 2 [Y,Y X] ) = χ1 (e−Y1 XY2 ).
If X = X1 ⊕ X2 ∈ Hom(Yr+1 , Re1 ) ⊕ Hom(Rel+1 , Xr ) then [X, Y ] = −X1 Y2 + Y1 X2 and
the action of X is by the character
                                           χ1 (e−X1 Y2 +Y1 X2 )
and if X belongs to the center of N then clearly the action will be by the character
                                                 χ1 (eX ).
The statement of the lemma follows by a simple calculation.                                 
  One can see that by the duality provided via bilinear form β, The restriction of a
representation of rank one to the nilradical of Pr is a direct integral of characters which
correspond to linear operators of the form Y2+ Y1+ , which have rank one (in the usual
sense) even when the domain is restricted to Rel+1 . Proof of the following theorem
(which shows the equivalence of the two notions of rank) is similar to that of Theorem
6.2.10.
Theorem 6.3.2. Let G = SLl+1 (R). Then the restriction of a pure-rank representation
of G of rank k (in the sense of Definition 5.3.3) to the abelian nilradical of Pr is supported
on unitary characters of rank k.
Remark. Note that when l is even, the maximum rank of the unitary characters is 2l ,
which is the same as the height of the H-tower subgoup of G. However, for odd l, the
maximum rank of unitary characters exceeds the height of the H-tower group by one.
