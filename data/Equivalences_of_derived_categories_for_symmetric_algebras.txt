                                                                                 1. Introduction
                                                It is about a decade since Broué made his celebrated conjecture [2] on equivalences of de-
                                            rived categories in block theory: that the module categories of a block algebra A of a finite
                                            group algebra and its Brauer correspondent B should have equivalent derived categories
                                            if their defect group is abelian. Since then, character-theoretic evidence for the conjecture
                                            has accumulated rapidly, but until very recently there have been very few examples where
                                            the conjecture has actually been verified. This is because the precise structure of, say, the
                                            indecomposable projective modules for A is known only in the simplest cases (although
                                            the corresponding structure for B is much easier to determine): this makes it very difficult
                                            to carry out explicit calculations to verify an equivalence of derived categories.
                                                Recently, however, Okuyama [6] introduced a method of proving that there is an equiv-
                                            alence of derived categories that needs very little explicit information about A.
                                                In many of the simpler cases where Broué’s conjecture is not yet known to be true,
                                            there is known to be a ‘stable equivalence of Morita type’ between A and B: an exact
                                            functor between the module categories that is an equivalence of categories ‘modulo pro-
                                            jective modules’. This is a consequence of an equivalence of derived categories, since the
                                            stable module category is a canonical quotient of the derived category. Moreover, recent
                                            work of Rouquier [11],[12] gives a method of constructing such stable equivalences from
                                            equivalences of derived categories for smaller groups.
                                                Okuyama’s method is a strategy for lifting stable equivalences to equivalences of derived
                                            categories. If one can produce an equivalence of derived categories between B and a third
                                            algebra C, and if the objects of the derived category D b (mod(B)) that correspond to
                                            the simple C-modules are isomorphic in the stable module category of B (regarded as a
                                            quotient category of D b (mod(B))) to the images of the simple A-modules under a stable
                                            equivalence of Morita type, then it follows from a theorem of Linckelmann [5, Theorem 2.1]
                                            that A and C are Morita equivalent, and so A and B have equivalent derived categories.
                                            Note that to carry out this strategy, one needs to know nothing about A except which
                                            objects of the stable module category of B correspond to the simple A-modules.
                                                Okuyama used this method to verify Broué’s conjecture for many examples of blocks
                                            with defect group C3 × C3 [6].
                                                This still leaves the problem of finding a suitable equivalence

                                            (1.1)                           D b (mod(B)) ≈ D b (mod(C))
                                                                                           1

of derived categories. Okuyama did this by constructing a suitable ‘tilting complex’ T for
B: by the main theorem of [8], T is the object corresponding to the free C-module under
an equivalence (1.1), where C is the endomorphism algebra of T . The main theorem of
this paper, Theorem 5.1, gives an alternative approach. Rather than characterizing the
objects of D b (mod(B)) that correspond to free modules under equivalences of derived
categories, as the definition of a tilting complex does, we characterize the sets of objects
that can correspond to the simple modules. Our proof requires only that B should be a
symmetric algebra, which is of course the case for a block of a finite group algebra; it is
easy to construct counterexamples for general finite-dimensional algebras, but we do not
know any counterexamples for self-injective algebras.
   Since Linckelmann’s theorem focuses on the simple modules, this new characterization of
derived equivalence is well suited to applying his theorem as Okuyama did. In Section 7 we
give several fairly simple examples. Simple modules have a less complicated structure than
projective modules, so it is no surprise that in our examples the objects of D b (mod(B))
that we construct (corresponding to the simple A-modules) are considerably simpler than
the tilting complex (corresponding to a free A-module) would be.
   In a recent paper [3], Chuang has used our main theorem to give a proof of Broué’s
conjecture for the principal block of SL(2, p2 ) in characteristic p for an arbitrary prime
p. Using different methods, this result has subsequently been extended to SL(2, pn ) for
all n by Okuyama [7]. Holloway [4] has also used our main theorem to verify Broué’s
conjecture for several blocks, including the principal block of the sporadic Hall-Janko
group in characteristic five, using computer calculations.

                             2. Conventions and notation
   Throughout most of this paper, k will be an algebraically closed field. This is not
really essential, but for the sake of clarity we prefer to avoid the (entirely routine) added
complication involved in dealing with a field that is not algebraically closed. In Section 8
we shall give details of the minor modifications that need to be made to deal with a general
field.
   By a ‘module’ for a ring, we shall mean a left module unless we specify otherwise.
   If Λ is a ring, then Mod(Λ) will be the category of all (left) Λ-modules. If Λ is a finite-
dimensional k-algebra, then mod(Λ) will be the category of finitely generated Λ-modules
and proj(Λ) will be the category of finitely generated projective Λ-modules.
   If Λ is a finite-dimensional self-injective k-algebra (i.e., the injective and projective
Λ-modules coincide), then stmod(Λ) will be the stable module category, which is the
quotient of mod(Λ) by the ideal of maps that factor through projective modules. This
is a triangulated category with shift functor the inverse Ω−1 of the Heller translate. The
space of maps from M to N in stmod(Λ) will be denoted by HomΛ (M, N ).
   Our ‘complexes’ will all be cochain complexes, so the differentials will have degree +1.
   If
                                           di−1     di
                       X := · · · −→ X i−1 −→
                                            X
                                               X i −→
                                                    X

is a cochain complex, then X[m] will be X ‘shifted m places to the left’: i.e., X[m]i = X i+m
and diX[m] = (−1)m di+m
                     X .

   If A is an additive category, then K(A) will be the chain homotopy category of cochain
complexes over A, K − (A) will be the full subcategory consisting of complexes X that
are ‘bounded above’ (i.e., X i = 0 for i >> 0) and K b (A) will be the full subcategory of
‘bounded’ complexes (i.e., complexes X with X i = 0 for all but finitely many i).
   If A is an abelian category, then D(A) will be the derived category of cochain com-
plexes over A, and D − (A) and D b (A) will be the full subcategories of complexes that are
respectively bounded above and bounded.
   We shall regard an abelian category A as a full subcategory of its derived category D(A)
in the usual way, identifying an object X of A with the complex whose only non-zero term
is X in degree zero.

                      3. Preliminaries on symmetric algebras
  A finite-dimensional k-algebra Λ is said to be symmetric if there is a symmetrizing
form on Λ: i.e., a linear map λ : Λ → k such that
                                 ∀x, y ∈ Λ, λ(xy) = λ(yx),
and such that the kernel of λ contains no non-zero left or right ideal of Λ.
   The principal example is the group algebra kG of a finite group, when λ can be taken
to be
                                        1 if g = 1
                                      n
                               λ(g) =
                                        0 if g ∈ G − {1},
extended linearly to the whole of kG. Any block algebra of kG is also a symmetric algebra,
using the restriction of the same map λ to the block.
   The following theorem, giving characterizations of symmetric algebras in terms of the
module category, is well-known, but for the readers’ convenience we include a proof.
Theorem 3.1. Let Λ be a finite-dimensional k-algebra. The following conditions are
equivalent.
 (a) Λ is symmetric.
  (b) Λ and its dual Λ∨ = Homk (Λ, k) are isomorphic as Λ-bimodules.
  (c) Homk (?, k) and HomΛ (?, Λ) are isomorphic as functors from the category of left Λ-
       modules to the category of right Λ-modules.
 (c′ ) Homk (?, k) and HomΛ (?, Λ) are isomorphic as functors from the category of right
       Λ-modules to the category of left Λ-modules.
 (d) For finitely generated projective left Λ-modules P and finitely generated left Λ-modules
       M , there is an isomorphism of k-vector spaces
                               HomΛ (P, M ) ∼ = HomΛ (M, P )∨ ,
      functorial in both P and M .
(d′ ) For finitely generated projective right Λ-modules P and finitely generated right Λ-
      modules M , there is an isomorphism of k-vector spaces
                              HomΛ (P, M ) =∼ HomΛ (M, P )∨ ,
     functorial in both P and M .

Proof. Since (a) and (b) are left-right symmetric, it is sufficient to prove that (a) and (b)
are equivalent and that (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (d) ⇒ (b).
  First we shall show that (a) implies (b). Let λ : Λ → k be a symmetrizing form on Λ.
Consider the map
                                    θ : Λ → Homk (Λ, k)
defined by θ(x) = x.λ for x ∈ Λ: i.e., θ(x) : Λ → k is the map
                                    y 7→ λ(yx) = λ(xy).
Since θ(xz) is the map
                            y 7→ λ(yxz) = λ(zyx) = (x.λ.z)(y),
θ is a Λ-bimodule homomorphism.
   Now let x ∈ Λ, and suppose θ(x) = 0. Then λ(yx) = 0 for all y ∈ Λ, and so the left
ideal Λx is contained in the kernel of λ. Since λ is a symmetrizing form, this implies x = 0.
Hence θ is injective, and is therefore an isomorphism, since Λ and Λ∨ are vector spaces of
the same dimension.
   To show (b) implies (a), suppose θ : Λ → Λ∨ is a Λ-bimodule isomorphism. Let
λ = θ(1). Then for x, y ∈ Λ,
        λ(xy) = θ(1)(xy) = (yθ(1))(x) = θ(y)(x) = (θ(1)y)(x) = θ(1)(yx) = λ(yx).
Also, suppose the left ideal Λx is contained in the kernel of λ. Then for every y ∈ Λ,

                             0 = λ(yx) = (xθ(1))(y) = θ(x)(y),
and so θ(x) = 0, and so x = 0, since θ is an isomorphism. Similarly, no non-zero right
ideal of Λ is contained in the kernel of λ, and so λ is a symmetrizing form on Λ.
   Next we show that (b) implies (c). Suppose that Λ and Λ∨ are isomorphic as Λ-
bimodules. Let M be a left Λ-module. There is a chain of natural isomorphisms of right
Λ-modules
       HomΛ (M, Λ) ∼ = HomΛ (M, Homk (Λ, k)) ∼  = Homk (Λ ⊗Λ M, k) ∼ = Homk (M, k).
   Next assume that (c) is true, and let us deduce (d). Let M and P be finitely generated
left Λ-modules. Then HomΛ (M, P ) ∼  = Homk (P ∨ ⊗Λ M, k), and since these are all finite-
dimensional vector spaces, HomΛ (M, P )∨ ∼  = P ∨ ⊗Λ M , which, since (c) is true, is in turn
isomorphic to HomΛ (P, Λ) ⊗Λ M . There is a natural map
(3.1)                     HomΛ (P, Λ) ⊗Λ M −→ HomΛ (P, M ),
sending α ⊗ m (where α ∈ HomΛ (P, Λ) and m ∈ M ) to the map P → M sending p ∈ P to
α(p)m. For P = Λ, it is easy to check that (3.1) is an isomorphism between vector spaces
naturally isomorphic to M . By naturality, (3.1) is also an isomorphism for P any direct
summand of a finite direct sum of copies of Λ; i.e., for any finitely generated projective
module P .
   Finally, the fact that (d) implies (b) follows by taking M = P = Λ Λ. The natural
isomorphism
                                     Λ∼= HomΛ (Λ, Λ)
           EQUIVALENCES OF DERIVED CATEGORIES FOR SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS                         5

is an isomorphism of Λ-bimodules, where the bimodule structure on the right hand side is
induced by the right action of Λ by multiplication on the two arguments. But by (d) the
right hand side is naturally isomorphic to its dual, and by naturality this isomorphism is
an isomorphism of bimodules. Hence (b).
  We shall most often be using condition (d).
  Here is a corollary about maps in the derived category.
Corollary 3.2. Let Λ be a finite-dimensional symmetric k-algebra. Let P ∗ be a bounded
complex of finitely generated projective left Λ-modules, and let M ∗ be a complex of finitely
generated left Λ-modules. Then HomD(Mod(Λ)) (P ∗ , M ∗ ) and HomD(Mod(Λ)) (M ∗ , P ∗ ) are
naturally dual.
Proof. Since P ∗ is a bounded complex of projective and (since Λ is symmetric) injective
modules, calculating homomorphisms from or to P ∗ in the derived category is equivalent
to doing so in the chain homotopy category K(Mod(Λ)).
   Recall that if X ∗ and Y ∗ are complexes of Λ-modules, then HomK(Mod(Λ)) (X ∗ , Y ∗ ) may
be calculated as the degree zero homology of the ‘completed’ total complex of the double
complex HomΛ (X ∗ , Y ∗ ) (i.e., the variation of the total complex where the terms are formed
by taking direct products rather than the direct sums of diagonals in the double complex).
In fact, the fact that P ∗ is bounded ensures that for X ∗ = P ∗ and Y ∗ = M ∗ or vice versa,
there is only a finite number of non-zero terms on each diagonal, and so the completed
total complex is the same as the usual total complex.
   Condition (d) of Theorem 3.1 implies that the double complexes HomΛ (P ∗ , M ∗ ) and
HomΛ (M ∗ , P ∗ ) are naturally dual. By the remark at the end of the last paragraph, their
total complexes are complexes of finite dimensional vector spaces and are also naturally
dual. Taking degree zero homology, the corollary follows.

                       4. Preliminaries on homotopy colimits
   In this section, Λ will be an arbitrary ring.
   Let
                                      α0      α1     α2
                                 X0 −→   X1 −→   X2 −→  ...
be a sequence of maps in a triangulated category T with countable coproducts. Recall [1]
that the homotopy colimit hocolim(Xi ) of this sequence is defined by forming the dis-
tinguished triangle
                     M∞          M∞                         ∞
                                                            M
(4.1)                    Xi −→       Xi −→ hocolim(Xi ) −→    Xi [1],
                     i=0         i=0                           i=0
where the restriction of the first map to Xi is idXi − αi . This defines hocolim(Xi ) up to
isomorphism, but not usually up to unique isomorphism.
   If T is the derived category D(Mod(Λ)), and if we can choose chain maps βi representing
the maps αi of the derived category, then hocolim(Xi ) is isomorphic to the usual colimit
in the category of chain complexes of the sequence
                                       β0    β1      β2
                                X0 −→ X1 −→ X2 −→ . . . .
6                                   JEREMY RICKARD

This is an easy consequence of the fact that the coproduct, in the derived category, of a
family of complexes is the same as the coproduct in the category of chain complexes.
  An object C of the triangulated category T is called compact if the functor Hom(C, ?)
commutes with arbitrary coproducts: more precisely, if the natural map
                           M                           M
                              Hom(C, Xi ) −→ Hom C,        Xi )
                          i∈I                           i∈I

is an isomorphism whenever {Xi : i ∈ I} is a set of objects of T whose coproduct exists
in T .
   In the derived category D(Mod(Λ)) of a module category, the compact objects are
precisely those that are isomorphic to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective
modules.
   An easy consequence of the definition is that if C is a compact object, then there is a
natural isomorphism

                      Hom C, hocolim(Xi ) −→ colim Hom(C, Xi ) .
  We shall need a generalization of this. Let us say that a family X of objects of the
derived category D(Mod(Λ)) is uniformly bounded below if there is some n ∈ Z such
that the degree j cohomology H j (X) of X is zero for all X ∈ X and all j < n.
Proposition 4.1. Let C be an object of D(Mod(Λ)) isomorphic to a complex of finitely
generated projective Λ-modules that is bounded above. For example, if Λ is a finite-
dimensional k-algebra, let C be any object of D − (mod(Λ)).
   (a) Let X be a family of objects of D(Mod(Λ)) that is uniformly bounded below. Then
the natural map
                          M                             M         
                                Hom(C, X) −→ Hom C,           X
                          X∈X                           X∈X

is an isomorphism.
   (b) Let X0 → X1 → X2 → . . . be a sequence of maps in the derived category D(Mod(Λ)),
and suppose that {Xi : i ∈ N} is uniformly bounded below. Then
                      Hom C, hocolim(Xi ) ∼

                                             = colim Hom(C, Xi ) .
Proof. First, if Λ is a finite-dimensional k-algebra, then any object of D − (mod(Λ)) is
isomorphic to its minimal projective resolution, which is a complex of finitely generated
projective Λ-modules that is bounded above.
   (a) Without loss of generality, we shall assume that every X ∈ X is a complex with no
non-zero terms in negative degrees, and that C is the bounded above complex
                      . . . −→ C −2 −→ C −1 −→ C 0 −→ C 1 −→ . . . ,
of finitely generated projectives. Let C̃ be the truncated complex
                       . . . −→ 0 −→ C −1 −→ C 0 −→ C 1 −→ . . . ,

which is a bounded complex of finitely generated projectives. The inclusion C̃ → C of
complexes induces an isomorphism
                      HomD(Mod(Λ)) (C, Y ) −→ HomD(Mod(Λ)) (C̃, Y )
                        L
for Y ∈ X and for Y = X∈X X. The proposition follows because C̃ is compact.
   (b) This follows because, by (a), the natural map
                        M                            M          

                        i∈N                                i∈N
is an isomorphism for every m, and so the long exact sequence obtained by applying the
functor Hom(C, ?) to the triangle (4.1) breaks up into a sequence of short exact sequences,
including one isomorphic to
             M                    M
        0 −→     Hom(C, Xi ) −→       Hom(C, Xi ) −→ Hom(C, hocolim(Xi )) −→ 0,
              i∈N                   i∈N

which expresses Hom(C, hocolim(Xi )) as the colimit of Hom(C, Xi ).

                                  5. The main theorem
    Let Λ and Γ be two rings. A necessary and sufficient condition [8] for the derived
categories D(Mod(Λ)) and D(Mod(Γ)) to be equivalent as triangulated categories is that
there should be a tilting complex in D(Mod(Λ)) whose endomorphism ring is isomorphic
to Γ: i.e., a bounded complex T of finitely generated projective Λ-modules such that
   (i) Hom(T, T [m]) = 0 for m 6= 0, and
  (ii) the direct summands of T generate K b (proj(Λ)) as a triangulated category,
with End(T ) ∼     = Γ.
    If T is such a tilting complex, then there is an equivalence D(Mod(Λ)) ≈ D(Mod(Γ))
that sends T to the free Γ-module of rank one, so the indecomposable summands of T
correspond to the indecomposable projective Γ-modules.
    We shall use later the fact [8] that, for a finite-dimensional algebra Λ, condition (ii) can
be replaced by the condition that, for any non-zero object C of D − (mod(Λ)), Hom(T, C[m]) 6=
0 for some m ∈ Z.
    In this section we shall consider instead the objects X0 , . . . , Xr of D(Mod(Λ)) that corre-
spond to the simple Γ-modules in the case that Λ and Γ are finite-dimensional symmetric
k-algebras. Since an equivalence D(Mod(Λ)) ≈ D(Mod(Γ)) restricts to an equivalence
between the full subcategories of objects isomorphic to bounded complexes of finitely gen-
erated modules, X0 , . . . , Xr must (up to isomorphism) be objects of D b (mod(Λ)). Also,
for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ r, they must satisfy
  (a) Hom(Xi , Xj [m]) = 0 for m < 0,
                             0 if i 6= j
                          n
  (b) Hom(Xi , Xj ) =                    , and
                             k if i = j
  (c) X0 , . . . , Xr generate D b (mod(Λ)) as a triangulated category,
since the simple Γ-modules satisfy the corresponding properties.
    In this section we shall prove a partial converse to this.

Theorem 5.1. Let Λ be a finite-dimensional symmetric k-algebra. Let X0 , . . . , Xr be
objects of D b (mod(Λ)) satisfying conditions (a)–(c) above. Then there is another finite-
dimensional symmetric k-algebra Γ and an equivalence of triangulated categories
                                      D(Mod(Λ)) ≈ D(Mod(Γ))
sending X0 , . . . , Xr to the simple Γ-modules.
   We shall give the proof as a sequence of lemmas.
   What we shall do is construct a tilting complex T = T0 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Tr for Λ such that, for
0 ≤ i, j ≤ r and m ∈ Z,
                                          n k if i = j and m = 0
(5.1)                  Hom(Ti , Xj [m]) =
                                             0 otherwise.

Lemma 5.2. Suppose there is a tilting complex T = T0 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Tr for Λ satisfying the
property (5.1). Then Theorem 5.1 is true.
Proof. For Γ = End(T ), there is an equivalence of triangulated categories
                                  F : D(Mod(Λ)) → D(Mod(Γ))
sending T0 , . . . , Tr to the indecomposable projective Γ-modules P0 , . . . , Pr . Since the sim-
ple Γ-modules S0 , . . . , Sr , numbered so that Pi is the projective cover of Si , are character-
ized up to isomorphism in D(Mod(Γ)) by the fact that, for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ r and m ∈ Z,
                                               n k if i = j and m = 0
                            Hom(Pi , Sj [m]) =                          ,
                                                 0 otherwise
the equivalence F sends X0 , . . . , Xr to the simple modules S0 , . . . , Sr .
  Since a ring whose derived category is equivalent to a finite-dimensional symmetric
k-algebra is itself a finite-dimensional symmetric k-algebra [9], Theorem 5.1 follows.
    Now let us construct the summands Ti of the tilting complex T .
         (0)
    Set Xi := Xi . By induction on n, we shall construct a sequence
                           (0)        (1)                   (n−1)         (n)
                         Xi      → Xi       → · · · → Xi            → Xi        → ...
of objects and maps in D(Mod(Λ)).
                                         (n−1)
   Suppose we have constructed Xi              . For each 0 ≤ j ≤ r and t < 0, choose a basis
  (n−1)                        (n−1)         (n−1)
Bi      (j, t) of Hom(Xj [t], Xi     ), let Zi     (j, t) be a direct sum of copies of Xj [t] indexed
     (n−1)
by Bi       (j, t), and let
                                  (n−1)             (n−1)               (n−1)
                                 αi       (j, t) : Zi       (j, t) → Xi
                                                                (n−1)
be the map whose restriction to the summand of Zi       (j, t) corresponding to an element
      (n−1)
β ∈ Bi      (j, t) is just β. Now let
                                    (n−1)
                                            M (n−1)
                                  Zi      =  Zi     (j, t),
                                                  0≤j≤r

and let
                                     (n−1)      (n−1)          (n−1)
                                    αi       : Zi       → Xi
                                                         (n−1)              (n−1)
be the map whose restriction to the summand Zi                   (j, t) is αi          (j, t).
  All that will matter about this map is that
          (n−1)
 (a) Zi       is a (possibly infinite) direct sum of objects, each of which is isomorphic to
     Xj [t] for some 0 ≤ j ≤ r and some t < 0,
                              (n−1)                   (n−1)                (n−1)
 (b) the map Hom(Xj [t], Zi         ) → Hom(Xj [t], Xi      ) induced by αi      is surjective
     for every 0 ≤ j ≤ r and t < 0, and
                                (n−1)                     (n−1)               (n−1)
 (c) the map Hom(Xj [−1], Zi          ) → Hom(Xj [−1], Xi       ) induced by αi      is an iso-
     morphism for every 0 ≤ j ≤ r.
  The map we have constructed clearly satisfies properties (a) and (b). Since
                      Hom(Xj [−1], Xj ′ [t]) = Hom(Xj , Xj ′ [t + 1]) = 0
for all 0 ≤ j, j ′ ≤ r and t < 0 except for j = j ′ and t = −1, property (c) is also satisfied.
                    (n)                               (n−1)
   Now define Xi , together with a map from Xi              , by forming the distinguished tri-
angle
                                (n−1)
                         (n−1) αi          (n−1)         (n)           (n−1)
(5.2)                  Zi       −→ Xi               −→ Xi      −→ Zi            [1].
                                     (n)
  Finally, define Ti := hocolim(Xi ).
                                                               (n−1)
Remark. In general it will not be possible to choose Zi    in the bounded derived category
   b                                                    (n−1)
D (mod(Λ)) that satisfy properties (a)–(c), even if Xi        is in D b (mod(Λ)). However,
if Λ is the group algebra of a finite group, then one can prove, using the fact that the
cohomology algebra is finitely generated, that we can do so, and so, by induction on n, we
                   (n)
may force every Xi to be in D b (mod(Λ)). However, it is still not obvious a priori that
the homotopy colimit Ti will be in D b (mod(Λ)).

Lemma 5.3. If Y is an object of D − (mod(Λ)), then
                                                        (n) 
                            Hom(Y, Ti ) ∼
                                        = colim Hom(Y, Xi ) .
Proof. A projective resolution of Y is a complex of finitely generated projective Λ-modules
that is bounded above, so the Lemma will follow from Proposition 4.1(b) if we can show
         (n)
that {Xi : n ≥ 0} is uniformly bounded below.
   Since {Xi : 0 ≤ i ≤ r} is a finite set of objects of D b (mod(Λ)), we shall assume,
without loss of generality, that the cohomology H m (Xi ) vanishes for all m < 0. But
             (n)
then H m (Zi ) = 0 for all i, n and all m < 1, and so, by induction on n and the long
                                                                                    (n)
exact sequence of homology for the distinguished triangle (5.2), we have H m (Xi ) = 0
                                              (n)
for all m < 0 and all n. In other words, {Xi : n ≥ 0} is uniformly bounded below, as
required.

Lemma 5.4. For 0 ≤ i, j ≤ r, and m ∈ Z,
                                     n k if i = j and m = 0
                  Hom(Xj , Ti [m]) =
                                        0 otherwise.
Proof. We shall prove this lemma by considering the natural map
                                   (n−1)                      (n)
(5.3)                  Hom(Xj , Xi         [m]) −→ Hom(Xj , Xi [m])
by using the long exact sequence obtained by applying the functor Hom(Xj , ?) to the
distinguished triangle (5.2).
                                             (n−1)
   Since, by Proposition 4.1(a), Hom(Xj , Zi       [m]) = 0 for m ≤ 0, the map (5.3) is an
isomorphism for m < 0 and is injective for m = 0.
                        (n−1)    (n−1)    (n−1)
   By property (c) of αi      : Zi     → Xi     , the map (5.3) is also surjective for m = 0.
   Since, for m ≤ 0,
                                              k if i = j and m = 0
                                            n
                                   (0)
                      Hom(Xj , Xi [m]) =                               ,
                                              0 otherwise
Lemma 5.3 implies the cases of the lemma involving m ≤ 0.
                        (n−1)
  By property (b) of αi       , the map (5.3) is zero for m > 0. So Lemma 5.3 implies that
Hom(Xj , Ti [m]) = 0 for m > 0.

Lemma 5.5. For each 0 ≤ i ≤ r, Ti is a compact object of D(Mod(Λ)): i.e., it is
isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projectives.
Proof. For an object Y of D(Mod(Λ)), consider the vector space
                                M
                                     Hom(Y, Ti [m]).
                                     m∈Z
By Lemma 5.4 this is finite-dimensional for Y = Xj , for any 0 ≤ j ≤ r. The class of objects
Y for which it is finite-dimensional form a full triangulated subcategory of D(Mod(Λ)),
and so, since {Xj : 0 ≤ j ≤ r} generates D b (mod(Λ)) as a triangulated category, it is
finite-dimensional for any Y in D b (mod(Λ)).
   In particular,
                                 H m (Ti ) ∼
                             M               M
                                           =   Hom(Λ, Ti [m])
                            m∈Z               m∈Z
is finite-dimensional,
             L         so Ti is isomorphic to an object of D b (mod(Λ)). Then, for any simple
module S, m∈Z Hom(S, Ti [m]) is finite-dimensional, so a minimal injective resolution of
Ti contains only a finite number of copies of the injective hull of S. Thus this injective
resolution is a bounded complex of finitely generated injectives, which are also projective,
since Λ is symmetric.

Lemma 5.6. For 0 ≤ i, j ≤ r and m ∈ Z,
                                       k if i = j and m = 0
                                     n
                  Hom(Ti , Xj [m]) =
                                       0 otherwise.

Proof. Since, by Lemma 5.5, we now know that Ti is isomorphic to a bounded complex of
projectives, this follows by combining Lemma 5.4 and Corollary 3.2.

Lemma 5.7. For 0 ≤ i, j ≤ r and m 6= 0,
                                       Hom(Ti , Tj [m]) = 0.
Proof. By Lemma 5.6, Hom(Ti , Xl [m]) = 0 for all m < 0 and 0 ≤ l ≤ r. Hence, for any n,
           (n)                                                                (n)
Hom(Ti , Zj [m]) = 0 for m ≤ 0, since Ti is compact (by Lemma 5.5) and Zj is a direct
sum of copies of negative shifts of copies of various Xl s. Applying the functor Hom(Ti , ?)
to the triangle 5.2, we get an exact sequence
                   (n−1)                       (n)                     (n−1)
        Hom(Ti , Xj        [m]) → Hom(Ti , Xj [m]) → Hom(Ti , Zj               [m + 1]) = 0
                                                       (n)
for every m < 0. So by induction on n, Hom(Ti , Xj [m]) = 0 if m < 0.
   By Proposition 4.1(b), Hom(Ti , Tj [m]) = 0 if m < 0. For m > 0 it follows that
Hom(Tj , Ti [m]) = 0 by Corollary 3.2.

Lemma 5.8. Let C be an object of D − (mod(Λ)). If C ∼
                                                    6= 0, then for some 0 ≤ i ≤ r and
some m ∈ Z, Hom(C, Ti [m]) 6= 0.
Proof. Since C is bounded above and Xi is bounded, Hom(C, Xi [m]) = 0 for m << 0.
   However, if Hom(C, Xi [m]) = 0 for all i and m, then Hom(C, X) = 0 for every object X
of D b (mod(Λ)), since {Xi : 0 ≤ i ≤ r} generates D b (mod(Λ)) as a triangulated category.
In particular, Hom(C, Λ[m]) = 0 for all m, and so C ∼   = 0.
   Thus, if C =∼
               6 0, we can choose m and i so that Hom(C, Xi [m]) 6= 0 and m is minimal:
i.e., Hom(C, Xj [m′ ]) = 0 for all 0 ≤ j ≤ r and all m′ < m.
   Let us apply the functor Hom(C, ?) to the triangle (5.2). Since, by Proposition 4.1(a),
           (n−1)
Hom(C, Zi        [m]) = 0, we get an exact sequence
                           (n−1)                     (n−1)                       (n)
           0 = Hom(C, Zi           [m]) → Hom(C, Xi          [m]) → Hom(C, Xi [m]).
In other words,
                                       (n−1)                     (n)
                           Hom(C, Xi     [m]) → Hom(C, Xi [m])
                                                  (n)                       (0)
is injective for every n ≥ 1. Hence colim Hom(C, Xi [m]) 6= 0, since Hom(C, Xi [m]) 6=
0. So by Lemma 5.3, Hom(C, Ti [m]) 6= 0.
  We now have all the ingredients to complete the proof of our main theorem.
                                                                                L
Proof of Theorem 5.1. By Lemmas 5.2 and 5.6, it is sufficient to show that T = 0≤i≤r Ti
is a tilting complex for Λ.
   Lemma 5.5 shows that T is isomorphic in D(Mod(Λ)) to a bounded complex of finitely
generated projective modules.
   Lemma 5.7 shows that Hom(T, T [m]) = 0 for m 6= 0.
   We just need to show that if C is an object of D − (mod(Λ)) such that Hom(T, C[m]) = 0
for all m ∈ Z, then C ∼= 0. Let C be such an object. By Corollary 3.2,
                          Hom(C, T [−m]) ∼ = Hom(T, C[m])∨ ∼  =0
12                                     JEREMY RICKARD

for all m ∈ Z, and so C ∼
                        = 0 by Lemma 5.8.

                              6. Lifting stable equivalences
  Suppose Γ′ is another algebra satisfying the conclusion of Theorem 5.1. Then we have
an equivalence of derived categories
                                 D b (mod(Γ)) ≈ D b (mod(Γ′ ))
that takes the simple Γ-modules to the simple Γ′ -modules. Since the finitely generated
projective modules P are characterized up to isomorphism in D b (mod(Γ)) by the fact that
Hom(P, S[m]) = 0 for every simple module S and every integer m 6= 0, this equivalence of
derived categories restricts to give an equivalence
                                      proj(Γ) ≈ proj(Γ′ ).
Hence the algebra Γ is determined up to Morita equivalence by the objects X0 , . . . , Xr .
  In general, however, the algebra Γ might be hard to identify. In this section we shall
build on an idea of Okuyama to show how this algebra can be identified in certain cases.
  First we shall briefly describe Okuyama’s method [6] of lifting stable equivalences to
equivalences of derived categories.
6.1. Okuyama’s method. Let A and B be finite-dimensional self-injective k-algebras.
   Recall that the stable module category stmod(A) of A is equivalent to the quotient of
triangulated categories
                               D b (mod(A))/K b (proj(A)).
Thus any object X of D b (mod(A)) determines an object of the stable module category
stmod(A). For example, if X is the bounded complex
                              · · · → X i−1 → X i → X i+1 → . . . ,
and if X i is projective for i 6= 0, then this object of stmod(A) is just X 0 . A little more
generally, if all the terms of X except for X n are projective, then the corresponding object
of stmod(A) is Ωn (X n ). If two objects of D b (mod(A)) become isomorphic in stmod(A),
we shall say that they are stably isomorphic.
   Since any equivalence of derived categories
                                 D b (mod(A)) ≈ D b (mod(B))
restricts to an equivalence
                                K b (proj(A)) ≈ K b (proj(B)),
an equivalence of derived categories induces an equivalence of stable module categories.
This stable equivalence is ‘of Morita type’; i.e., it is induced (up to isomorphism) by an
exact functor between the module categories mod(A) and mod(B).
  Suppose we know that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type
                                  F : stmod(A) ≈ stmod(B),
and suppose we can produce an equivalence of derived categories
                               G : D b (mod(B)) ≈ D b (mod(C)),
            EQUIVALENCES OF DERIVED CATEGORIES FOR SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS                           13

where C is a third self-injective k-algebra: for example, we might construct a tilting
complex for B and take C to be its endomorphism algebra. Okuyama’s idea was to use a
theorem [5, Theorem 2.1] of Linckelmann, which states that if there is a stable equivalence
of Morita type
                                  stmod(A) ≈ stmod(C),
for self-injective algebras A and C, that takes the simple A-modules to the simple C-
modules, then A and C are Morita equivalent, and so their derived categories are certainly
equivalent. Thus if we can choose G above so that the induced equivalence between
stmod(A) and stmod(C) has this property, then
                        D b (mod(A)) ≈ D b (mod(C)) ≈ D b (mod(B)).
   In a typical case of Broué’s conjecture, where A is a block algebra of a group G with
abelian defect group D, and B is the Brauer correspondent block algebra of NG (D), the
structure of B is much easier to determine and understand than that of A. This is the
reason Okuyama’s method is so useful for proving special cases of Broué’s conjecture: so
long as we already know that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type between A and B,
and so long as we can determine the images of the simple modules under this equivalence,
the method requires no more information about A.
   Okuyama has successfully used his method to verify several cases of Broué’s conjecture:
for example, many cases involving defect group C3 × C3 .
6.2. Combining Okuyama’s method with Theorem 5.1. Since Theorem 5.1 not
only provides an algebra Γ whose derived category is equivalent to that of Λ, but also
identifies the objects that are sent to the simple Γ-modules, it immediately combines with
Okuyama’s method to give the following theorem.
Theorem 6.1. Let Λ and Γ be finite-dimensional symmetric k-algebras, let
                                    F : mod(Γ) → mod(Λ)
be an exact functor inducing a stable equivalence of Morita type, and let {S0 , . . . , Sr } be a
set of representatives for the isomorphism classes of simple Γ-modules.
   If there are objects X0 , . . . , Xr of D b (mod(Λ) such that, for each 0 ≤ i ≤ r, Xi is stably
isomorphic to F (Si ), and such that
  (a) Hom(Xi , Xj [m]) = 0 for m < 0,
                             0 if i 6= j
                          n
  (b) Hom(Xi , Xj ) =                     , and
                             k if i = j
  (c) X0 , . . . , Xr generate D b (mod(Λ)) as a triangulated category,
then D(Mod(Λ)) and D(Mod(Γ)) are equivalent as triangulated categories.
6.3. Objects with homology concentrated in one degree. As in Theorem 6.1, let
Λ and Γ be finite-dimensional symmetric k-algebras,let
                                    F : mod(Γ) → mod(Λ)
be an exact functor inducing a stable equivalence of Morita type, and let {S0 , . . . , Sr } be
a set of representatives for the isomorphism classes of simple Γ-modules. We shall assume
14                                   JEREMY RICKARD

that F (Si ) is indecomposable for every i: if this is not the case, then F has a summand
that induces an isomorphic stable equivalence and which does send simple modules to
indecomposable modules, so this assumption does not involve any real loss of generality.
   In order to use Theorem 6.1 to prove that Λ and Γ have equivalent derived categories,
we need to find suitable objects X0 , . . . , Xr of D b (mod(Λ)) that are stably isomorphic
to F (S0 ), . . . , F (Sr ). We shall consider the case where each of these objects has non-
zero homology in only one degree. Since X0 , . . . , Xr must certainly be indecomposable if
condition (b) of the theorem is to be satisfied, we must then have
(6.1)                                       ∼ Ωni F (Si )[ni ]
                                         Xi =
for some integers n0 , . . . , nr .
   Let us consider what is required in order for these objects to satisfy conditions (a) and
(b) of Theorem 6.1. It turns out that many of the conditions are satisfied automatically,
especially if n0 , . . . , nr are small.
   Recall that if M and N are modules for a finite-dimensional self-injective k-algebra A,
then for m > 0 there are natural isomorphisms
                Extm (M, N ) ∼
                  A                = HomD(Mod(A)) (M, N [m]) ∼
                                                             = Hom (Ωm M, N ).
                                                                A

Proposition 6.2. Conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 6.1 are satisfied by the objects Xi
of (6.1) if
   (i) EndΛ (Ωni F (Si )) ∼= k for 0 ≤ i ≤ r,
  (ii) HomΛ (Ω F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )) = 0 whenever i 6= j and ni ≤ nj ,
                 n i


and if the four equivalent conditions
 (iii) HomΛ (Ωm F (Si ), F (Sj )) = 0 whenever −1 > m > ni − nj ,
 (iv) HomΓ (Ωm Si , Sj ) = 0 whenever −1 > m > ni − nj ,
  (v) ExtpΛ (F (Sj ), F (Si )) = 0 whenever 0 < p < nj − ni − 1,
 (vi) ExtpΓ (Sj , Si ) = 0 whenever 0 < p < nj − ni − 1,
are satisfied.
   Before we prove this, let us point out how few conditions this leaves us to check when
n0 , . . . , nr do not vary very much.
Corollary 6.3. Suppose
                                    max |ni − nj | ≤ 2.
                                   0≤i,j≤r
Then conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 6.1 are satisfied by the objects Xi of (6.1) if
  (i) EndΛ (Ωni F (Si )) ∼
                         = k for 0 ≤ i ≤ r, and
 (ii) HomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )) = 0 whenever i 6= j and ni ≤ nj .
Proof of Proposition 6.2. The case i = j of condition (b) of Theorem 6.1 is just condi-
tion (i) of the proposition.
   Since
                Hom(Xi , Xj [m]) = Hom(Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )[m + nj − ni ]),
we have Hom(Xi , Xj [m]) = 0 when m + nj − ni < 0, so we need only consider values of m
with ni − nj ≤ m ≤ 0.
            EQUIVALENCES OF DERIVED CATEGORIES FOR SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS                          15

  The case 0 ≥ m = ni − nj requires
                               0 = HomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj ))
when i 6= j, which is condition (ii) of the proposition.
  Since F induces a stable equivalence,
                        HomΛ (Ωm F (Si ), F (Sj )) ∼
                                                   = HomΓ (Ωm Si , Sj )
for any m, and by Tate duality these spaces are dual to
                      Hom (Ωp F (Sj ), F (Si )) ∼
                              Λ                 = Hom (Ωp Sj , Si )
                                                            Γ

for p = −1 − m.
   What remains to be checked is that these spaces are zero for 0 ≥ m > ni − nj , or
−1 + nj − ni < p ≤ −1 (in which case ni 6= nj , so i 6= j). Since Si and Sj are non-
isomorphic simple modules,
                             HomΓ (Si , Sj ) = 0 = HomΓ (Sj , Si ),
so the cases m = 0, p = −1 and m = −1, p = 0 are automatically satisfied. The remaining
cases are just conditions (iii) to (vi) of the proposition.
   In fact, projective maps are the only obstruction to the automatic satisfaction of condi-
tion (i) and, if nj −ni < 2, of condition (ii). For Λ-modules M and N , write PHomΛ (M, N )
for the space of projective maps from M to N , so that
                       HomΛ (M, N ) = HomΛ (M, N )/ PHomΛ (M, N ).

Proposition 6.4. (a) Condition (i) of Proposition 6.2 (or Corollary 6.3) is satisfied for
a given i if and only if
                         PHomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωni F (Si )) = 0.
  (b) Condition (ii) is satisfied for a given i and j if and only if
                              PHomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )) = 0
and either
  (I) nj − ni < 2, or
                         n −n −1
 (II) nj − ni ≥ 2 and ExtΓj i (Sj , Si ) = 0.
Proof. Since F induces a stable equivalence,
                    HomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )) ∼
                                                    = HomΓ (Si , Ωnj −nj Sj ),
which is isomorphic to k if i = j, is zero if i 6= j and ni = nj , is dual to HomΓ (Sj , Si ) = 0
                                  n −n −1
if nj − ni = 1, and is dual to ExtΓj i (Sj , Si ) if nj − ni > 1.

Remark. Since there are no non-zero projective maps from a simple module to a mod-
ule with no projective summands, the vanishing of PHomΛ (Ωni F (Si ), Ωnj F (Sj )) = 0 is
automatic if Ωni F (Si ) is a simple Γ-module.

                                   7. Some examples
  We shall give some examples to show how Theorem 6.1 can be used to verify specific
cases of Broué’s conjecture on equivalences of derived categories for blocks with abelian
defect group.
Conjecture 7.1 (Broué). Let A be a block algebra of a finite group algebra kG, where k
is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. Suppose that a defect group D of A
is abelian. Let H = NG (D), and let B be the Brauer correspondent of A: a block algebra
of kH. Then there is an equivalence D(Mod(A)) ≈ D(Mod(B)) of triangulated categories.
   We shall use the notation (G, H, A, B, D, k, p) of Conjecture 7.1 in all the examples.
In each case we shall describe a set X = {Xi : 0 ≤ i ≤ r} of objects of D b (mod(B)) that
are stably isomorphic to the images of the simple A-modules under a stable equivalence.
We shall then need to check the conditions of Theorem 6.1. The last of these conditions is
that D b (mod(B)) is generated as a triangulated category by the elements of X . We shall
use the notation hX i to refer to the triangulated category generated by X , and to prove
that this is the whole of D b (mod(B)) we shall show that each of the simple B-modules is
in hX i.
   All of these examples are already known by other methods, but Theorem 6.1 provides
a simpler proof. In these cases we shall give references to previous proofs.
   In all the examples we give, it is well-known that there is a stable equivalence which
coincides with Green correspondence on objects.
   We start with a very simple example.

7.1. Principal block of G = A5 , p = 2. The alternating group G = A5 ∼      = SL(2, 4) ∼
                                                                                       =
P SL(2, 5) has Sylow 2-subgroup P = C2×C2 , with normalizer H = NG (P ) = A4 ∼
                                    ∼                                      ∼   = P⋊C3 .
   The principal block A of kG has three simple modules: the trivial module and two
2-dimensional modules.
   B = kH has three 1-dimensional simple modules, which we will denote by k, 1 and 2.
   The restrictions of the simple A-modules have the following structures.
                                                  1             2
                             Y0 := k,     Y1 :=     ,   Y2 :=
                                                  2             1
   We shall take X0 := k and Xi := ΩYi [1] for i ∈ {1, 2}. The structure of ΩYi is as
follows.
                                    k               k
                             ΩY1 :=    , ΩY2 :=
                                    1               2
  To verify conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 6.1, it is sufficient, by Corollary 6.3, to
note that
                              EndB (k) ∼
                                       = EndB (ΩYi ) ∼
                                                     =k
and that
                                    HomB (k, ΩYi ) = 0
for i ∈ {1, 2}.
           EQUIVALENCES OF DERIVED CATEGORIES FOR SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS                      17

  Finally, to verify condition (c) of Theorem 6.1, note that k is certainly in hX i, and the
other two simples are in hX i because they are the kernels of surjective maps
                                           ΩYi → k.
  Hence D b (mod(A)) ≈ D b (mod(B)) by Theorem 6.1.
  The first published proof of this example is in [10].
7.2. Principal block of G = A7 , p = 3. The alternating group G = A7 has Sylow
3-subgroup P ∼= C3 ×C3 , with normalizer H = NG (P ) ∼
                                                     = P ⋊C4 .
   The principal block A of kG has four simple modules: the trivial module, two 10-
dimensional modules and a 13-dimensional module.
   B = kH has four 1-dimensional simple modules, which we will denote by k, 1, 2 and 3.
Fixing a generator x for C4 ≤ H and a primitive fourth root of unity ζ ∈ k, x acts on the
simple module i as multiplication by ζ i .
   The Green correspondents of the simple A-modules have the following Loewy structures.
                                                             2
                     Y0 := k,   Y1 := 1,       Y2 := 1               3 ,   Y3 := 3
                                                             2
  The Loewy structure of the projective cover of the simple module 2 is:

                                                     2
                                                 1       3
                                P (2) := k           2           k ,
                                                 1       3
                                                     2
and so
                                           k                     k
                                 ΩY2 :=         1        3 .
                                                  2
   We shall take X0 := k, X1 := 1, X2 := ΩY2 [1], X3 := 3.
   Since ΩY2 has simple 2 as its socle, and since this simple occurs with multiplicity one
as a composition factor of ΩY2 , the conditions of Corollary 6.3 are satisfied.
   To check condition (c) of Theorem 6.1, note that the simples k, 1 and 3 are certainly in
hX i, and hence M := ΩY2 / soc(ΩY2 ) is in hX i, since each composition factor is isomorphic
to one of k, 1, 3. Therefore the simple 2 is in hX i, since it is the kernel of the natural
surjection ΩY2 → M .
   Okuyama [6] gave the first proof of this example.
7.3. Principal block of G = A8 , p = 3. The alternating group G = A8 has Sylow
3-subgroup P ∼= C3 ×C3 , with normalizer H = NG (P ) ∼= P ⋊D8 .
   The principal block A of kG has five simple modules: the trivial module and modules
with dimensions 7, 13, 28 and 35.
   B = kH has four 1-dimensional modules, which we shall denote by k, 1, 2 and 3. We
shall choose the names so that the kernel of the action of D8 on the simple 2 is cyclic,

whereas the kernels of the actions on 1 and 3 are elementary abelian of rank two. There
is also a 2-dimensional simple module S.
   The Green correspondents of the simple A-modules have the following Loewy structures.

                                                    1
                      Y0 := k,      Y1 := 2,Y2 := S , Y3 := 3, Y4 := S
                                                    1
     We shall take Xi := Yi for i ∈ {0, 1, 3, 4} and X2 := ΩY2 [1].
     The Loewy structure of the projective cover of the simple module 1 is
                                                    1
                                                    S
                                                  k 1 2 ,
                                                    S
                                                    1
and so ΩY2 has the structure
                                                  k        2
                                               S    .
                                               1
   Since ΩY2 has simple socle 1, and since 1 only occurs with multiplicity one as a com-
position factor, EndB (ΩY2 ) ∼  = k and HomB (Xi , ΩY2 ) = 0 for i ∈ {0, 1, 3, 4}. Hence the
conditions of Corollary 6.3 are satisfied.
   Condition (c) of Theorem 6.1 also holds, because clearly all the simples other than 1
are in hX i, and since ΩY2 , which contains 1 as a composition factor with multiplicity one,
is also in hX i, it follows that 1 is in hX i.
   Okuyama [6] gave the first proof of this example.

                                  8. General coefficient fields
   The only use we made of the condition that k is algebraically closed was to assume that
the endomorphism ring of a simple module for a finite-dimensional k-algebra was just k.
Our main theorem, Theorem 5.1, is true a little more generally for a field k that is not
algebraically closed, as we can allow End(Xi ) to be any finite-dimensional division algebra
over k. The only difference in the construction of the objects Ti is that rather than using
            (n−1)                        (n−1)                                (n−1)
a k-basis Bi      (j, t) of Hom(Xj [t], Xi     ) in order to form the object Zi     (j, t), we
should use a basis as a left End(Xj )-module.
   Theorem 6.1 generalizes similarly.
