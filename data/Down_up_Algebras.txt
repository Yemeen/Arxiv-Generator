                                                   Abstract. The algebra generated by the down and up operators on a differential
                                                   partially ordered set (poset) encodes essential enumerative and structural properties
                                                   of the poset. Motivated by the algebras generated by the down and up operators on
                                                   posets, we introduce here a family of infinite-dimensional associative algebras called
                                                   down-up algebras. We show that down-up algebras exhibit many of the important
                                                   features of the universal enveloping algebra U(sl2 ) of the Lie algebra sl2 including
                                                   a Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt type basis and a well-behaved representation theory. We
                                                   investigate the structure and representations of down-up algebras and focus especially
                                                   on Verma modules, highest weight representations, and category O modules for them.
                                                   We calculate the exact expressions for all the weights, since that information has
                                                   proven to be particularly useful in determining structural results about posets.

                                             Combinatorial source of down-up algebras.

                                                Assume P is a partially ordered set (poset), and let CP denote the complex
                                             vector space whose basis is the set P . For many posets there are two well-defined
                                             linear transformations on CP coming from the order relation on P ,
                                                                                X                             X
                                                                       d(y) =         x    and       u(y) =         z,
                                                                                x≺y                           y≺z


                                             where ≺ denotes the covering relation in the poset. Thus, d(y) is the sum of
                                             the elements which y covers, and u(y) is the sum of the elements which cover

y. (These are the “down” and “up” operators.) Young’s lattice of all partitions
of all nonnegative integers provides an important example of such a poset. If
µ = (µ1 , µ2 , . . . ) and ν = (ν1 , ν2 , . . . ) are partitions (with parts arranged so µ1 ≥
µ2 ≥ · · · and ν1 ≥ ν2P≥ · · · ), then    P µ ≤ ν if µi ≤ νi for each i. The partition ν
covers µ if µ ≤ ν and i νi = 1 + i µi . In ([St1], [St2]), Stanley found that many
of the interesting enumerative and structural properties of Young’s lattice could be
deduced from the following relation that the up and down operators satisfy,

                                        du − ud = I,
where I is the identity transformation on CP . Young’s lattice of partitions is
not the only example, and Stanley considered more general posets which satisfy
the relation du − ud = rI for some fixed positive integer r. Such posets afford a
representation of the Weyl algebra generated by u and d/r. Since the Weyl algebra
also can be realized as differential operators y 7→ d/dx and x 7→ x (multiplication by
x) on C[x], Stanley referred to the posets satisfying du − ud = rI as “r-differential”
or simply “differential” when r = 1. Fomin [F] independently defined essentially
the same class of posets for r = 1 calling them “Y-graphs”, the terminology inspired
by Young’s lattice.

  In his study of uniform posets [T], Terwilliger considered finite ranked posets P
whose down and up operators satisfy the following relation

                     di di+1 ui = αi di ui−1 di + βi ui−2 di−1 di + γi di ,
where di and ui denote the restriction of d and u to the elements of rank i. (There
is an analogous second relation,

               di+1 ui ui−1 = αi ui−1 di ui−1 + βi ui−1 ui−2 di−1 + γi ui−1 ,
which holds automatically in this case because di+1 and ui are adjoint operators
relative to a certain bilinear form.) The matrix algebra over the reals generated
by these operators together with the idempotent projection maps onto each rank,
(referred to as the “incidence algebra” in [T]), is finite-dimensional and in [T] its
finite-dimensional simple representations are determined. Terwilliger also discusses
many families of examples including the four presented below.

   In many classical cases the constants in the above relations do not depend on
the rank of the poset. A particular instance of this provides a q-analogue of the
notion of differential poset. A partially ordered set whose down and up operators
satisfy


                            d2 u = q(q + 1)dud − q 3 ud2 + rd
(1.1)
                            du2 = q(q + 1)udu − q 3 u2 d + ru

where q and r are fixed complex numbers is said to be “(q, r)-differential”. Examples
of (q, r)-differential posets include the posets of alternating forms, quadratic forms,
or Hermitian forms over a finite field, as well as Hemmeter’s poset:

   (1) [Altq (n), (n ≥ 2)] The poset of alternating bilinear forms
       Assume H is an n-dimensional vector space over the field GF (q) of q el-
       ements. Consider the set of pairs P = {(U, f ) | U is a subspace of H
       and f is an alternating bilinear form on U } with the following ordering:
       (U, f ) ≤ (V, g) if U is a subspace of V and g|U = f . Then P is a (q, r)-
       differential poset with r = −q n (q + 1).
   (2) [Quadq (n), (n ≥ 2)] The poset of quadratic forms
       The poset is defined the same way as in the first example but with “qua-
       dratic form” replacing “alternating bilinear form”. In this case P is
       (q, −q n+1 (q + 1))-differential.
   (3) [Herq (n), (n ≥ 2)] The poset of Hermitian forms
       In this example, H is taken to be an n-dimensional vector space over
       GF (q 2 ), and the bilinear forms are “Hermitian”. The result is a poset
       which is (q 2 , −q 2n+1 (q 2 + 1))-differential.
   (4) [Hemq (n), (q odd, n ≥ 2)] Hemmeter’s poset
       Suppose X + and X − are two copies of the graph of the dual polar space
       X = Cn−1 (q). Let Y be the bipartite graph with vertex set X + ∪ X −
       (forming the bipartition). Two vertices x+ ∈ X + and y − ∈ X − are adjacent
       in Y if and only if x = y or x and y are adjacent in X. The graph Y is a
       distance regular graph recently discovered by Hemmeter. Now set P = Y
       and fix u0 ∈ Y . Declare u ≤ v if δ(u0 , u)+δ(u, v) = δ(u0 , v), where δ(u, v) is
       the distance between u and v. (The choice of u0 is irrelevant since Y is vertex
       transitive.) Then like the poset Altq (n), P is (q, −q n (q + 1))-differential.


Definition of down-up algebras.

   In this paper we study certain infinite-dimensional associative algebras whose
generators satisfy relations more general than (1.1). Although the original moti-
vation for our investigations came from posets, we make no assumption about the
existence of posets whose down and up operators satisfy our relations.

   We say a unital associative algebra A = A(α, β, γ) over the complex numbers C
with generators u, d and defining relations

  (R1) d2 u = αdud + βud2 + γd,
  (R2) du2 = αudu + βu2 d + γu,
4                          GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

where α, β, γ are fixed but arbitrary elements of C, is a down-up algebra.

    It is easy to see that when γ 6= 0 the down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) is isomorphic
to A(α, β, 1) by the map d 7→ d′ , u 7→ γu′ . Therefore, it would suffice to treat just
two cases γ = 0, 1. But rather than divide all our considerations into these cases,
it is convenient to retain the notation γ throughout.

Examples of down-up algebras.

   If d and u are the down and up operators of a (q, r)-differential poset, and
B is the associative algebra they generate, then B satisfies (R1) and (R2) with
α = q(q + 1), β = −q 3 , and γ = r. Thus, B is a homomorphic image of the
algebra A(α, β, γ) with these parameters. In an r-differential poset, the relation
du − ud = rI is satisfied. Multiplying on the left by d and on the right by d and
adding the resulting equations, we get the relation d2 u − ud2 = 2rd of a (−1, 2r)-
differential poset. Thus, the Weyl algebra is a homomorphic image (by the ideal
generated by du − ud − r1) of the algebra A(0, 1, 2r). More generally, the q-Weyl
algebra is a homomorphic image of the algebra A(0, q 2 , q+1) (and also of the algebra
A(q − 1, q, 2)) by the ideal generated by du − qud − 1. The skew polynomial algebra
Cq [d, u], or quantum plane (see [M]), is the associative algebra with generators d, u
which satisfy the relation du = qud. Therefore, Cq [d, u] is a homomorphic image
(by the ideal generated by du−qud) of the algebra A(2q, −q 2 , 0) (also of the algebra
A(aq, (1 − a)q 2 , 0) for any a ∈ C).

   Consider a 3-dimensional Lie algebra L over C having a basis x, y, [x, y] such
that [x[x, y]] = γx and [[x, y], y] = γy. In the universal enveloping algebra U (L) of
L, the relations above become

                                x2 y − 2xyx + yx2 = γx
                                xy 2 − 2yxy + y 2 x = γy.
Thus, U (L) is a homomorphic image of the down-up algebra A(2, −1, γ) via the
mapping φ : A(2, −1, γ) → U (L) with φ : d 7→ x, φ : u 7→ y. In fact, U (L) is
isomorphic to A(2, −1, γ). The mapping ψ : L → A(2, −1, γ) with ψ : x 7→ d,
ψ : y 7→ u, and ψ : [x, y] 7→ du − ud extends, by the universal property of U (L),
to an algebra homomorphism ψ : U (L) → A(2, −1, γ). The two homomorphisms
φ and ψ are inverses of each other. Every 3-dimensional Lie algebra L over C
with L = [L, L] has such a basis (see [J, pp. 13-14]), so its enveloping algebra is a
down-up algebra.

   There are several noteworthy special cases. The Lie algebra sl2 of 2 × 2 complex
matrices of trace zero has a standard basis e, f, h, which satisfies [e, f ] = h, [h, e] =
2e, and [h, f ] = −2f . From this we see that U (sl2 ) ∼
                                                       = A(2, −1, −2). The Heisenberg
Lie algebra H has a basis x, y, z where [x, y] = z, and [z, H] = 0. Thus, U (H) ∼        =
A(2, −1, 0).

   In [Sm], S.P. Smith investigated a class of associative algebras that have many
of the properties of the enveloping algebra U (sl2 ) but also many new, interesting
aspects. These algebras have a presentation by generators a, b, h and relations
[h, a] = a, [h, b] = −b and ab − ba = f (h), where f (h) is a polynomial in h. In
the special situation that deg(f ) ≤ 1, such an algebra is a homomorphic image of
a down-up algebra A(2, −1, γ) for some γ. Algebras related to Smith’s appear in
Hodges’ work [H] on primitive factors of U (sl2 ) and type-A Kleinian singularities.

   Woronowicz [Wo] introduced a family of algebras whose presentation is equiva-
lent to having three generators x, y, z which are assumed to satisfy the relations

          xz − ζ 4 zx = (1 + ζ 2 )x     zy − ζ 4 yz = (1 + ζ 2 )y   xy − ζ 2 yx = ζz
for some scalar ζ 6= ±1, 0. These algebras are down-up algebras with α = ζ 2 (1 +
ζ 2 ), β = −ζ 6 , and γ = ζ(1 + ζ 2 ). Woronowicz’s algebras fit into a more general
construction studied by Jordan in [Jo].

 The Lie   superalgebra S = sl(1, 1) = S0 ⊕ S1 of 2 × 2 complex matrices, y =
  y1 y2
              with supertrace y1 − y4 = 0 and with multiplication given by the su-
  y3 y4
percommutator [x, y] = xy − (−1)ab yx for x ∈ Sa , y ∈ Sb has a presentation by
generators e, f (which are odd and can be identified with the matrix units e = e1,2 ,
f = e2,1 ) and relations [e, [e, f ]] = 0, [[e, f ], f ] = 0, [e, e] = 0, [f, f ] = 0. Its univer-
sal enveloping algebra U (sl(1, 1)) has generators e, f and relations e2 f − f e2 = 0,
ef 2 − f 2 e = 0, e2 = 0, f 2 = 0. Thus, U (sl(1, 1)) is a homomorphic image of the
down-up algebra A(0, 1, 0) by the ideal generated by the elements e2 and f 2 , which
are central in A(0, 1, 0).


Connections with Witten’s deformation of U (sl2 ).

   To provide an explanation of the existence of quantum groups, Witten ([W1],
[W2]) introduced a 7-parameter deformation of the universal enveloping algebra
U (sl2 ). Witten’s deformation is a unital associative algebra over a field K (which
is algebraically closed of characteristic zero and which could be assumed to be C)
and depends on a 7-tuple ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξ7 ) of elements of K. It has a presentation
by generators x, y, z and defining relations


                        xz − ξ1 zx = ξ2 x             zy − ξ3 yz = ξ4 y
                                  yx − ξ5 xy = ξ6 z 2 + ξ7 z.

We denote the resulting algebra by W(ξ). It can be argued that the following holds:
 6                         GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

 Theorem 1.2. ([B, Thm. 2.6]) A Witten deformation algebra W(ξ) with


 (1.3)                 ξ6 = 0, ξ5 ξ7 6= 0, ξ1 = ξ3 , and ξ2 = ξ4

 is isomorphic to the down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) with α, β, γ given by


                         1 + ξ1 ξ5            ξ1              ξ2 ξ7
 (1.4)              α=             ,    β=−      ,     γ=−          .
                            ξ5                ξ5               ξ5

 Conversely, any down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) with not both α and β equal to 0 is
 isomorphic to a Witten deformation algebra W(ξ) whose parameters satisfy (1.3).


    A deformation algebra W(ξ) has a filtration, and Le Bruyn ([L1], [L2]) investi-
 gated the algebras W(ξ) whose associated graded algebras are Auslander regular.
 They determine a 3-parameter family of deformation algebras which are called con-
 formal sl2 algebras and whose defining relations are


 (1.5)         xz − azx = x        zy − ayz = y      yx − cxy = bz 2 + z

 When c 6= 0 and b = 0, the conformal sl2 algebra with defining relations given by
 (1.5) is isomorphic to the down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) with α = c−1 (1 + ac), β =
 −ac−1 and γ = −c−1 . If b = c = 0 and a 6= 0, then the conformal sl2 algebra is
 isomorphic to the down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) with α = a−1 , β = 0 and γ = −a−1 .

    In a recent paper Kulkarni [K1] has shown that under certain assumptions on the
 parameters a Witten deformation algebra is isomorphic to a conformal sl2 algebra
 or to a double skew polynomial extension. The precise statement of the result is

 Theorem 1.6. ([K1, Thm. 3.0.3]) If ξ1 ξ3 ξ5 ξ2 6= 0 or ξ1 ξ3 ξ5 ξ4 6= 0, then W(ξ) is
 isomorphic to one of the following algebras:
(a) A conformal sl2 algebra with generators x, y, z and relations given by (1.5) for
    some a, b, c ∈ K.
(b) A double skew polynomial extension (that is, a skew polynomial extension of a
    skew polynomial ring) whose generators satisfy
      (i) xz − zx = x, zy − yz = ζy, yx − ηxy = 0 or
      (ii) xw = θwx, wy = κyw, yx = λxy
    for parameters ζ, η, θ, κ, λ ∈ K.

    Kulkarni [K1] studies the simple representations of the conformal sl2 algebras and
 of the skew polynomial algebras in (b) by making essential use of the observation

that the conformal sl2 algebras of (1.5) can be realized as hyperbolic rings. Kulkarni
applies results of Rosenberg [R] on left ideals of the left spectrum of hyperbolic
rings to determine the maximal left ideals for the conformal sl2 algebras. Further
applications of results of [R] give the left spectrum of the double skew polynomial
extensions in (b) of the theorem.


   In this work we investigate the structure and representations of the down-up alge-
bras A(α, β, γ). Remarkably down-up algebras have many of the important features
of universal enveloping algebras including a Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt basis theorem
and a well-behaved representation theory. Adopting a Lie theoretic approach, we
explicitly construct “highest weight” and “lowest weight” representations of the
algebras A(α, β, γ) and determine when they are simple. We calculate the exact
expressions for all the weights since that information has proven to be especially
useful in determining structural results about posets. (In particular, for differential
posets Stanley [St1] showed that the spectrum of ud is related to the eigenvalues of
the adjacency matrix of certain finite graphs associated with the posets. This gave
a new class of graphs whose spectra could be explicitly computed. Many interesting
properties associated to random walks on the graph are related to its spectrum.)


  In the spirit of the work of [BGG] we investigate two categories of modules (O and
 ′
O ) for down-up algebras whose simple objects include the highest weight simple
modules. Corresponding to each complex number λ, there is a universal infinite-
dimensional highest weight module V (λ), the so-called Verma module. Each of the
weight spaces of V (λ) is 1-dimensional or infinite-dimensional depending on the
choice of the parameters α, β, γ, λ. (Roots of unity play a critical role in deciding
which occurs.) Its weights are determined by the recurrence relation

                 λn = αλn−1 + βλn−2 + γ,         λ0 = λ,    λ−1 = 0.

In particular, for the algebra A(1, 1, 0), the weights of V (λ) are given by the Fi-
bonacci sequence λ, λ, 2λ, 3λ, 5λ, 8λ, . . . for each λ. Besides the examples coming
from (q, r)-differential posets and universal enveloping algebras, certain subalge-
bras of quantized enveloping algebras (quantum groups) are down-up algebras. The
highest weight representations that we construct for these subalgebras are not the
standard ones.


   Our investigations arose from conversations one of the authors (TR) had with
Paul Terwilliger. We would like to express our appreciation to him for many helpful
suggestions over the course of this project.

                  §2. Representations of down-up algebras

  As before, let A = A(α, β, γ) be a down-up algebra over C with generators u, d
and defining relations
    (R1) d2 u = αdud + βud2 + γd,
    (R2) du2 = αudu + βu2 d + γu,
where α, β, γ are fixed but arbitrary elements of C.

Highest weight modules.

   Our first objective is to construct “highest weight” representations of down-
up algebras. Involved in the construction is a certain sequence of elements of C.
Starting with λ−1 = 0 and an arbitrary λ0 = λ ∈ C, define λn for n ≥ 1 inductively
by the following recurrence relation:


(2.1)                          λn = αλn−1 + βλn−2 + γ.

Proposition 2.2. Set λ−1 = 0. Let λ0 = λ ∈ C be arbitrary, and define λn for
n ≥ 1 as in (2.1). Let V (λ) be the C-vector space having basis {vn | n = 0, 1, 2, . . . }.
Define

                    d · vn = λn−1 vn−1 ,    n ≥ 1,    and   d · v0 = 0
(2.3)
                    u · vn = vn+1 .
Then this action extends to an A(α, β, γ)-module action on V (λ).

  Proof. The free associative algebra Chu, di with 1 over C generated by u, d acts
on V (λ) by extending (2.3) making V (λ) into an Chu, di-module. To show there is
an induced action of A, it suffices to verify that

                           (d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd)vn = 0
                           (du2 − αudu − βu2 d − γu)vn = 0
for all n ≥ 0. But this is easy to see since


         (d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd)vn = λn−1 (λn − αλn−1 − βλn−2 − γ)vn−1 ,
and


        (du2 − αudu − βu2 d − γu)vn = (λn+1 − αλn − βλn−1 − γ)vn+1 = 0. 

Proposition 2.4.
  (a) The A(α, β, γ)-module V (λ) is simple if and only if λn 6= 0 for any n.
  (b) If m is minimal with the property that λm = 0, then M (λ) = spanC {vj | j ≥
  m + 1} is a maximal submodule of V (λ).
  (c) Suppose N is a submodule of V (λ) such that N ⊆ spanC {vj | j ≥ 1}. Then
  N ⊆ M (λ).
                                                                      Pn
   Proof. Assume N is a nonzero submodule of V (λ), and suppose x =      k=0   ak vk ∈
N , where an 6= 0. Then

                       dn · x = λn−1 λn−2 · · · λ1 λ0 an v0 ∈ N.
If the coefficient is nonzero, then v0 ∈ N , and since v0 generates V (λ), we have
N = V (λ) in this case.
   If λr = 0, then spanC {vj | j ≥ r + 1} is a proper submodule of V (λ) by (2.3).
Thus, V (λ) is simple if and only if λr 6= 0 for any r.
   Let m be the minimal value such that λm = 0. Then M (λ) = spanC {vj | j ≥
m + 1} is a submodule of V (λ). Suppose N is P       a submodule of V (λ) properly
                                                        m
containing M (λ). We may assume that some y = j=0 bj vj 6= 0 belongs to N . If
n ≤ m is maximal so bn 6= 0, then dn · y = λn−1 λn−2 · · · λ1 λ0 bn v0 ∈ N . By the
minimality of m this implies v0 ∈ N and hence that N = V (λ). Thus, M (λ) is a
maximal submodule of V (λ).
   Now assume N is a submodule of V (λ) contained in V1 = spanC {vj | j ≥ 1}.
The submodule N + M (λ) is contained in V1 , so it is a proper submodule of V (λ).
By the maximality of M (λ), we must have N + M (λ) = M (λ), which implies
N ⊆ M (λ). 

Definition 2.5. We will set M (λ) = (0) if V (λ) is simple and otherwise assume
M (λ) is defined by Proposition 2.4 (b) using the minimal m such that λm = 0.
Note that when M (λ) 6= (0), then M (λ) ∼
                                        = V (λm+1 ).

Example 2.6. Observe for any down-up algebra A = A(α, β, γ) that M (0) =
spanC {vj | j ≥ 1}, so that V (0)/M (0) is one-dimensional. There is an algebra
homomorphism ǫ : A → C with ǫ(u) = 0 = ǫ(d) and ǫ(1) = 1. This gives rise
to a one-dimensional A-module, Cv, such that a · v = ǫ(a)v for all a ∈ A, and
Cv ∼= V (0)/M (0).

Definition 2.7. A module V for A = A(α, β, γ) is said to be a highest weight
module of weight λ if V has a vector y0 such that d · y0 = 0, du · y0 = λy0 , and
V = Ay0 . The vector y0 is a maximal vector or highest weight vector of V .

  The highest weight module V (λ) is said to be the Verma module of highest
weight λ. It is so named because it shares the same universal property as Verma
modules for finite-dimensional semisimple complex Lie algebras:

Proposition 2.8. If V is a highest weight module of weight λ of A = A(α, β, γ),
then V is a homomorphic image of V (λ).

  Proof. Let y0 be a maximal vector of V of weight λ. Then V = Ay0 . The
mapping V (λ) → V with a·v0 7→ a·y0 for all a ∈ A is an A-module epimorphism. 

   Suppose V is any highest weight A-module of weight λ. Starting with a nonzero
maximal vector y0 ∈ V of weight λ, define yj inductively by yj = u · yj−1 for j ≥ 1.
Stop the inductive definition at the first place that a vector ym+1 is produced which
is a linear combination of the previous vectors. In this case we claim that V =
spanC {yj | j = 0, 1, . . . , m}. If no such dependency relation occurs, then we claim
that V = spanC {yj | j = 0, 1, . . . }, where the vectors yj are linearly independent.
To see these two assertions, first we show that


(2.9)                                du · yn = λn yn

where λ0 = λ and the λn ’s satisfy the recurrence relation in (2.1). The proof is by
induction on n with the inductive step being

               du · yn+1 = du2 · yn = αudu · yn + βu2 d · yn + γu · yn
                         = αλn yn+1 + βu2 du · yn−1 + γyn+1
                         = (αλn + βλn−1 + γ)yn+1 = λn+1 yn+1 .
Observe that this implies


(2.10)                      d · yn = du · yn−1 = λn−1 yn−1

for all n ≥ 1. Since d and u generate A, the relation yn+1 = u · yn together with
(2.10) shows that V = spanC {yj | j = 0, 1, . . . , m} when a dependency occurs, and
V = spanC {yj | j = 0, 1, . . . } otherwise. In both instances the yj ’s determine a
basis for V .

Weight modules.

   If we multiply the relation d2 u − αdud − βud2 = γd on the left by u and the
relation du2 − αudu − βu2 d = γu on the right by d and subtract the second from
the first, the resulting equation is


(2.11)           0 = ud2 u − du2 d       or     (du)(ud) = (ud)(du).

Therefore, the elements du and ud commute in A = A(α, β, γ). For any basis
element vn ∈ V (λ), we have du · vn = λn vn and ud · vn = λn−1 vn . Using that with

n = 0 and λ 6= 0, it is easy to see that du and ud are linearly independent. Let
h = Cdu ⊕ Cud.
                                                           P
   We say an A-module V is a weight module if V = ν∈h∗ Vν , where Vν = {v ∈
V | h · v = ν(h)v for all h ∈ h}, and the sum is over elements in the dual space h∗ of
h. (Necessarily this is a direct sum.) Any submodule of a weight module is a weight
module. If Vν 6= (0), then ν is a weight and Vν is the corresponding weight space.
Each weight ν is determined by the pair (ν ′ , ν ′′ ) of complex numbers, ν ′ = ν(du)
and ν ′′ = ν(ud), and often it is convenient to identify ν with (ν ′ , ν ′′ ). In particular,
highest weight modules are weight modules in this sense. The basis vector vn of
V (λ) is a weight vector whose weight is given by the pair (λn , λn−1 ). We will
explore next when two weights (λk , λk−1 ) and (λℓ , λℓ−1 ) can be equal. For that we
will need to know the values of λn more precisely.

Proposition 2.12. Assume λ−1 = 0, λ0 = λ, and λn for n ≥ 1 is given by the
recurrence relation λn − αλn−1 − βλn−2 = γ. Fix t ∈ C such that

Case (a): α + 4β 6= 0 and α + β 6= 1.
  In this first case r1 6= r2 and
                                                       γ
                            λn = c1 r1n + c2 r2n +         .
                                                     1−α−β
From λℓ = λk and λℓ−1 = λk−1 we see

                        c1 r1k (r1ℓ−k − 1) = −c2 r2k (r2ℓ−k − 1)
                        c1 r1k−1 (r1ℓ−k − 1) = −c2 r2k−1 (r2ℓ−k − 1).
Multiplying the second by r2 and subtracting gives

                            c1 r1k−1 (r1ℓ−k − 1)(r1 − r2 ) = 0.
This shows that c1 = 0, r1 = 0, or r1ℓ−k = 1. Analogously, c2 = 0, r2 = 0, or
r2ℓ−k = 1.
    Suppose initially that 0 = r2 = (1/2)α − t. Then r1 = (1/2)α + t = α 6= 0, and
t2 = (1/4)α2 implies β = 0. From Proposition 2.12 we see

When γ = 0, then λn = λαn , and λℓ = λk forces λ = 0 (Case (1)) or αℓ−k = 1
(Case (3) with γ = 0). When γ 6= 0, then either λn = (1 − α)−1 γ for all n (Case
(2)) or λn is as in (2.14) where αλ−k = 1 (Case (3) with β = 0).
   When r1 = 0 and r2 = α, the solutions are precisely the same. So we can assume
that neither r1 nor r2 is 0.
   Suppose
            next that c1 =0. Then λ = λ0 = c2 + (1 − α − β)−1 γ, which gives
λn = λ − (1 − α − β)−1 γ r2n + (1 − α − β)−1 γ. The condition c1 = 0 says that
r1 λ = (1 − α − β)−1 γ(α + β − r2 ). When c2 = 0, then λ = (1 − α − β)−1 γ and we
have

                                r1 γ   (α + β − r2 )γ
                                     =                .
                              1−α−β      1−α−β
If γ = 0, then λ = 0 and λn = 0 for all n (Case (1)). If γ 6= 0, then α = r1 + r2 =
α + β forces β = 0 and λn = (1 − α)−1 γ (Case (2)). The only other option is that
c2 6= 0 but r2ℓ−k = 1. That gives Case (3). The situation when c2 = 0 and c1 6= 0
also gives Case (3).
   Finally, if r1 , r2 , c1 , c2 are all nonzero, then r1ℓ−k = 1 = r2ℓ−k and
                                                       γ

Since α 6= 2, we see that the left-hand sides of (2.16) are 0, and γ = 0. Solving for
c1 , c2 from Proposition 2.12 we find that c1 = (2−α)−1 (1−α)λ and c2 = (2−α)−1 λ.

It follows from λℓ = λk and λℓ−1 = λk−1 that

Since s = (1/2)α 6= 0, we may use these equations to see that

                           c2 (sℓ−k − 1) = 0 = c1 (sℓ−k − 1).
Now if sℓ−k = 1, then (2.19) shows that c2 = 0, which says that λ = (2 − α)−1 (2γ).
Therefore, since c1 = λ − (2 − α)−2 4γ, we have

where s = (1/2)α satisfies sℓ−k = 1. This gives the solutions in (c). Now if
sℓ−k 6= 1, then c1 = 0 = c2 and λn = (2 − α)−2 4γ for all n. Those relations imply
(2−α)−1 2γ = (2−α)−2 4γ, which gives γ = 0 or α = 0. Since α 6= 0 by assumption,
γ = 0 and λn = 0 for all n.

Case (d): α2 + 4β = 0 and α = 2 and β = −1.
   The values of λn are given by λn = c1 sn + c2 nsn + (1/2)γn2, which reduces
to λn = c1 + c2 n + (1/2)γn2 because s = α/2 = 1. Solving for c1 and c2 using
Proposition 2.12, we see that c1 = λ and c2 = λ + γ/2. Therefore,

 and those equations combine to give

                                      γ(ℓ − k) = 0.
 It must be γ = 0 and λn = λ(n + 1). But then λℓ = λ(ℓ + 1) = λ(k + 1) = λk
 shows that λ = 0. We conclude that for the algebra A(2, −1, γ), the only time two
 weights (λℓ , λℓ−1 ) and (λk , λk−1 ) can be equal is if γ = 0 and λn = 0 for all n.
 Case (e): α = β = 0
      In this case λn = γ for all n ≥ 1. 

 Corollary 2.22. In V (λ) each weight space is either one-dimensional or infinite-
 dimensional. If an infinite-dimensional weight space occurs, there are only finitely
 many weights. The cases when V (λ) has an infinite-dimensional weight space are
 the ones listed in Theorem 2.13.


 Submodules of V (λ).

 Proposition 2.23. If each weight space of V (λ) is one-dimensional (i.e. if we are
 not in one of the cases described by Theorem 2.13), then the proper submodules of
 V (λ) have the form N = spanC {vj | j ≥ n} for some n > 0 with λn−1 = 0, and
 hence they are contained in M (λ).

    Proof. Suppose N is a proper submodule of V (λ). There exists some weight
 ν = (λn , λn−1 ) such that Nν 6= (0), and we may suppose that n is the least value
 with that property. Then vn ∈ N , and n is the smallest value for which that is
 true. Applying u we see that vj ∈ N for all j ≥ n. 

     To describe the submodules of V (λ) when its weights are given by Theorem 2.13,
 it is helpful to observe that if N is a proper submodule of any V (λ), then


 (2.24)                     IN = {f ∈ C[x] | f (u) · v0 ∈ N }

 is an ideal of C[x]. There exists a monic polynomial g(x) which generates that
 ideal. Then dimC V (λ)/N = deg(g) = k, and vi + N for i = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1 is a basis
 for V (λ)/N .

    The situations described by Theorem 2.13 can be grouped into four general types
 (see 2.17 and 2.20):

  (2.25)
 (i) γ = 0 and λn = 0 for all n.
(ii) λn = c for all n where c ∈ C satisfies c − αc − βc = γ.
                                   DOWN-UP ALGEBRAS                                   17

(iii) λn = (λ − c)r n + c where c ∈ C and r is a root of x2 − αx − β = 0. There is a
      least integer p ∈ Z>0 such that r p = 1.
(iv) λn = c1 r1n + c2 r2n + c where r1 6= r2 are roots of the equation x2 − αx − β = 0,
      and there is some smallest value p ∈ Z>0 so that r1p = 1 = r2p .

     (i) Assume first that A = A(α, β, 0) and consider the module V (0). Since λn = 0
  for all n, for any g ∈ C[x],


  (2.26)                  N (g) = spanC {f (u)g(u)v0 | f ∈ C[x]}

  is a submodule of V (0), which is proper if deg(g) ≥ 1. For each ξ ∈ C, the
  submodule N (x−ξ) is maximal, and every maximal submodule has this form. In
                                                            def
  particular, M (λ) = N (x) . The quotient module L(0, ξ) = V (0)/N (x−ξ) is spanned
  by v0 + N (x−ξ) where d · (v0 + N (x−ξ) ) = 0 and u · (v0 + N (x−ξ) ) = ξv0 + N (x−ξ) .

      (ii) Next suppose that A = A(α, β, γ), and the module is V (c) where 0 6= c ∈ C
  is such that c − αc − βc = γ. Then λn = c 6= 0 for all n. By Proposition 2.4, V (c)
  is simple.

     (iii) and (iv) These two cases behave similarly, and so we will treat them si-
  multaneously. Assume for A = A(α, β, γ) that the module V (λ) has weights given
  by

            λn = (λ − c)r n + c where c ∈ C, λ 6= c, and r p = 1, or
            λn = c1 r1n + c2 r2n + c where c ∈ C, c1 , c2 6= 0, and r1p = 1 = r2p .
  In each instance, we will assume
                             Pp     that p is chosen to be minimal. Then λn+p = λn
  for all n ≥ 0, and V (λ) = i=0 V (λ)νi , where νi = (λi , λi−1 ). Now νp = ν0 if and
  only if λp−1 = 0, which happens, for example, if β 6= 0.
     Suppose first that νp 6= ν0 , so that V (λ) has p + 1 distinct weights. If N is
  a submodule of V (λ) and Nν0 6= (0), then N = V (λ). In particular, any proper
  submodule N is contained in M (λ) by Proposition 2.4, so that M (λ) is the unique
  maximal submodule. We may assume that Nνj 6= (0) for some j = 1, . . . , p. Then
  (0) 6= up−j+k Nνj ⊆ Nνk so that all Nνk 6= (0). Therefore, for k 6= p,


  (2.27)                     {f ∈ C[x] | uk f (up ) · v0 ∈ Nνk }

  is a nonzero ideal of C[x], and we may assume that gk is its monic generator.
  Similarly, {f ∈ C[x] | f (up ) · v0 ∈ Nνp } is a nonzero ideal, whose monic generator
  we denote by gp . Then uk gk (up ) · v0 ∈ Nνk implies u(uk gk (up ) · v0 ) ∈ Nνk+1 . It
  follows that

                          gp−1 | gp−2 | · · · | g2 | g1 | gp | xgp−1 .
18                          GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

                                                      p
Either g1 = g2 = · · · = gp = g and N = N (g(x )) (see (2.26) for the notation), or
there is some value m such that gp−1 = · · · = gm+1 = g and gm = · · · = g1 = gp =
xg. Since d(um+1 g(up ) · v0 ) = λm um g(up ) · v0 , it must be that λm = 0 in this case.
It is easy to see that λk 6= λℓ for 1 ≤ k < ℓ ≤ p. Therefore m is the minimal value
                                                    m+1
                                                        g(xp ))
such that λm = 0. In this situation, N = N (x                   . As a special case, we have
             (xm+1 )
M (λ) = N            .
   In the case that νp = ν0 , the module V (λ) has p distinct weights. Assume N is
a proper submodule of V (λ). Arguing as above, we have that Nνk 6= (0) for each
k = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1. Letting gk be the monic generator for the ideal in (2.27), we
have

                         gp−1 | gp−2 | · · · | g2 | g1 | g0 | xgp−1 .

Again there are two possibilities. Either g0 = g1 = · · · = gp−1 = g and N =
      p
N (g(x )) , or else there is some value m such that gp−1 = · · · = gm+1 = g and
                                         m+1
                                             g(xp ))                   m+1
gm = · · · = g1 = g0 = xg. Here N = N (x             , and M (λ) = N (x    )
                                                                             .

Corollary 2.28. If γ = 0 = λ, then V (λ) has infinitely many maximal proper
submodules, each of the form N (x−ξ) = spanC {f (u)(u − ξ)v0 | f ∈ C[x]} =
spanC {vn − ξvn−1 | n = 1, 2, . . . } for some ξ ∈ C, and infinitely many one-
dimensional simple modules L(0, ξ) = V (0)/N (x−ξ) . In all other cases, M (λ) is
the unique maximal submodule of V (λ), and there is a unique simple highest weight

module of weight λ, L(λ) = V (λ)/M (λ), up to isomorphism.


Enveloping algebra examples.

   Recall that the universal enveloping algebra U (sl2 ) of sl2 is isomorphic to the
algebra A(2, −1, −2), and the universal enveloping algebra U (H) of the Heisenberg
Lie algebra H is isomorphic to A(2, −1, 0). For all the algebras A(2, −1, γ), we have
computed the values of λn in the proof of Case (d) of Theorem 2.13, and from
(2.21) we see that

                                        γ
                                  λn = ( n + λ)(n + 1).
                                        2
   In the sl2 -case, the operator h = du − ud is used rather than du. The eigenvalues
of h are λn − λn−1 = λ + nγ = λ − 2n, n = 0, 1, . . . , (as is customary in the
representation theory of sl2 ), and V (λ) is simple if and only if λ 6∈ Z≥0 . The
analogous computation in the Heisenberg Lie algebra shows that the central element
z = du − ud has constant eigenvalue λn = λ.

Since −ℓi = ℓi ai,j = ℓj aj,i = −ℓj , the coefficients [2]i and [2]j are equal. The
algebra Ui,j (with q is specialized to a complex number which is not a root of
unity) is isomorphic to A([2]i , −1, 0) by the mapping Ei 7→ d, Ej 7→ u. The same
result is true if the corresponding F ’s are used in place of the E’s. In particular,
when g = sl3 , the algebra Ui,j is just the subalgebra of Uq (sl3 ) generated by the
E’s.

   Here we compute the values of λn in the case of the algebra A([2]i , −1, 0). For
convenience of notation we write

                                       p = qi .
                p2 − p−2
Then α = [2]i =          = p + p−1 , β = −1 and γ = 0 so that
                p−p   −1


                     α2 + 4β = p2 + 2 + p−2 − 4 = (p − p−1 )2 .

Here r is an arbitrary element of the field. For this algebra α2 + 4β = q 2 (q − 1)2 ,
so we may assume that t = (1/2)q(q − 1) and r1 = 1/2(α + q(q − 1)) = q 2 and
r2 = 1/2(α − q(q − 1)) = q. (We will suppose throughout that q 6= 0, ±1). Then

 Lowest weight modules.

    To create lowest weight modules for A = A(α, β, γ) we reverse the roles of d and
 u. Thus, we assume there is a vector w0 such that u · w0 = 0, ud · w0 = κw0 and
 W = Aw0 . When β 6= 0, the eigenvalues of du are given by the sequence which has
 κ−1 = 0, κ0 = κ, an arbitrary complex number, and


                      βκn + ακn−1 − κn−2 = −γ,     or equivalently
 (2.29)
                      κn = β −1
                                                     
                                  − ακn−1 + κn−2 − γ

 for all n ≥ 1.

 Proposition 2.30. Let W (κ) be the C-vector space having basis {wn | n = 0, 1, 2, . . . }.
(a) Assume β 6= 0, κ−1 = 0, and κ0 = κ, an arbitrary element of C. Suppose κn for
    n ≥ 1 is as in (2.29), and define


                     u · wn = κn−1 wn−1 ,   n ≥ 1,    and     u · w0 = 0
 (2.31)
                     d · wn = wn+1 .

      Then this action gives W (κ) the structure of a lowest weight A(α, β, γ)-module.
(b) When β = 0 and α 6= 0, let κn be defined by
                                              n+1

    A(α, β, γ)-module.
(c) When γ 6= 0, the only lowest weight A(0, 0, γ)-module is the 1-dimensional mod-
    ule W = Cw0 with d · w0 = 0 = u · w0 . When γ = 0, set κn = 0 for all n. Then
    W (0) with the action given by (2.31) is a lowest weight A(0, 0, 0)-module.


    The proof of this result is identical to that of Proposition 2.2, and the following
 proposition can be shown using standard recurrence relation techniques.

 Proposition 2.32. Assume β 6= 0 and fix t ∈ C such that

Doubly-infinite modules.

Proposition 2.33. Assume β 6= 0 and let κ, λ be arbitrary but fixed complex num-
bers. Suppose λ0 = λ, λ1 = αλ + βκ + γ, and for n ≥ 2, λn is defined by the
recurrence relation λn = αλn−1 + βλn−2 + γ. Set λ−1 = κ and define λn−2 for all
n ≤ 0 by the equation λn = αλn−1 + βλn−2 + γ. The complex vector space V (κ, λ)
with basis {vn | n ∈ Z} and with


                                  d · vn = λn−1 vn−1
(2.34)
                                  u · vn = vn+1

is an A(α, β, γ)-module.

   Proof. As in our previous arguments, we may assume there is an action of the
free associative algebra generated by d and u on V (κ, λ) given by (2.34). Then

                                                            
       d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd vm = λm−1 λm − αλm−1 − βλm−2 − γ vm−1 = 0
                                                       
       du2 − αudu − βu2 d − γu vm = λm+1 − αλm − βλm−1 − γ vm = 0,

so that there is an induced action by A(α, β, γ). 

   If λm = 0 for any m, then the span of the vectors {vn | n ≥ m+1} is a submodule
of V (κ, λ).

Dual modules.

   Suppose V is any module for A = A(α, β, γ) and let {va | a ∈ I} be a basis for
V . Assume va∗ ∈ HomC (V, C) is defined by va∗ (vb ) = δa,b for all a, b ∈ I. Let V ∗ be
the finite dual of V (i.e. the finite linear combinations of the elements va∗ ). We will
show that V ∗ carries the structure of an A-module.

The antiautomorphism η
   Define a mapping η : A → A by first specifying η(u) = d and η(d) = u and
extending this to an antiautomorphism of the free associative algebra generated by
u and d. Then

            η(d2 u) = du2 = αudu + βu2 d + γu = η(αdud + βud2 + γd),
and a similar relation holds for du2 . Therefore η induces an antiautomorphism of
order 2 on A (which we also denote by η).

     Now define

                                 (x · v ∗ )(w) = v ∗ (η(x) · w)

for all x ∈ A, w ∈ V , and v ∗ ∈ V ∗ . It is easy to see that this makes V ∗ an
A-module.

   Suppose now that V = V (λ) is a highest weight A-module with basis {vn | n =
0, 1, . . . }. Then

                        (u · vℓ∗ )(vn ) = vℓ∗ (d · vn ) = λn−1 vℓ∗ (vn−1 )

                                              λℓ if n = ℓ + 1.
Therefore u · vℓ∗ = λℓ vℓ+1
                          ∗
                              . Similarly, d · vℓ∗ = vℓ−1
                                                      ∗
                                                          . If λn = 0 for some n, then V (λ)∗
is not generated by v0∗ . But whenever λn 6= 0 for all n, then V (λ)∗ is a highest
weight module. In fact, in that case V (λ)∗ ∼           = V (λ) under the mapping which
sends λn−1 · · · λ1 λ0 vn∗ to vn . We summarize what we have shown for highest weight
modules and the analogous results for lowest weight and doubly-infinite modules in
the following proposition.

Proposition 2.35. If Y is a module for A(α, β, γ), let Y ∗ denote the finite dual
of Y .
   (a) If V (λ) is a highest weight module as in Proposition 2.2, then V (λ)∗ is an
   A(α, β, γ)-module (which is a highest weight module isomorphic to V (λ) when-

                                       d · vn∗ = vn−1

                                                      .

   (b) If W (κ) is a lowest weight module as in Proposition 2.30, then W (κ)∗ is an
   A(α, β, γ)-module (which is a lowest weight module isomorphic to W (κ) whenever
   κn 6= 0 for all n) under the action

                                      u · wn∗ = wn−1

               §3. Structural results on down-up algebras


Theorem 3.1. (Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem) Assume A = A(α, β, γ) is a
down-up algebra over C. Then {ui (du)j dk | i, j, k = 0, 1, . . . } is a basis of A.


   Proof. It is clear from the defining relators f1 = d(du) −α(du)d −βud2 −γd and
f2 = (du)u − αu(du) − βu2 d − γu that the monomials ui (du)j dk , i, j, k = 0, 1, . . .
are all the irreducible words in A and so span A. We show that they are linearly
independent by applying the Diamond Lemma (see [Be]).
   We can order the words in the free algebra Chd, ui by their total degree in d
and u, and then lexicographically with d > u. Two words in Chd, ui admit a
composition if an end of one is a beginning of the other. We need to argue that
whenever the largest words w1 = d2 u and w2 = du2 in the relators f1 and f2 admit
a composition say, w1 = ab and w2 = bc or w2 = a′ b′ and w1 = b′ c′ , then

                        f1 c − af2 = a1 t1 f1 x1 + a2 t2 f2 x2    or
                          ′     ′
                      f2 c − a f1 = b1 y1 f1 z1 + b2 y2 f2 z2 ,
where ai , bi ∈ C, ti , xi , yi , zi are words in d, u (possibly empty), ti fi xi < abc,
and yi fi zi < a′ b′ c′ for i = 1, 2. There is exactly one admissible composition,
d2 u2 = d(du)u, of the largest words in the relators, and

             (d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd)u − d(du2 − αudu − βu2 d − γu)
                                           = βud2 u − βdu2 d = 0.
Therefore by the Diamond Lemma, the irreducible words form a basis of A. 

Corollary 3.2. The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of any down-up algebra A(α, β, γ)
is 3.


   Proof. Let A(n) = spanC {ui (du)j dk | i + 2j + k ≤ n}. The spaces A(n) afford
a filtration (0) ⊂ A(0) ⊂ A(1) ⊂ · · · ⊂ ∪n A(n) = A(α, β, γ) of the down-up algebra,
and A(m) A(n) ⊆ A(m+n) since the defining relations replace the words d2 u and du2
by words of the same or lower total degree. The number of monomials ui (du)j dk
with i + 2j + k = ℓ is (m + 1)(m + 1) if ℓ = 2m and is (m + 1)(m + 2) if ℓ = 2m + 1.
Thus, dimA(n) is a polynomial in n with positive coefficients of degree 3, and the
Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is given by

                    GKdim A(α, β, γ) = lim sup logn (dim A(n) )

  Recall that the Jacobson radical of a ring R is the intersection of all the
annihilators of the simple R-modules. It has many other characterizations, but
we will not need them here. A ring whose Jacobson radical is zero is said to be
semiprimitive.

Theorem 3.3. If A(α, β, γ) has infinitely many simple Verma modules V (λ), then
the intersection of the annihilators of the simple Verma modules is zero. Therefore,
such a down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) is semiprimitive.

   Proof. Suppose the element a = i,j,k ai,j,k ui (du)j dk annihilates all the simple
                                      P

modules V (λ). Assume there is a least value ℓ so that ai,j,ℓ 6= 0 for some i, j. Let
V (λ) be a simple highest weight module for A(α, β, γ) of weight λ. Applying a to
the vector vℓ in V (λ) we get
                                                    X
                   0 = a · vℓ = (λℓ−1 · · · λ1 λ0 )   ai,j,ℓ ui (du)j · v0
                                                      i,j
                                                      X
                              = (λℓ−1 · · · λ1 λ0 )         ai,j,ℓ λj0 ui · v0
                                                      i,j
                                                      X
                              = (λℓ−1 · · · λ1 λ0 )         ai,j,ℓ λj0 vi .
                                                      i,j

Recall that a necessary and sufficient condition for V (λ) to be simple is that none
of the λn is zero. The elements vi are linearly independent in V (λ), so combining
those results, we see for each i that
                                 X               X
                            0=      ai,j,ℓ λj0 =   ai,j,ℓ λj .
                                   j                  j

Because there are infinitely many values of λ that give simple highest weight mod-
ules and only finitely many λ that can be the roots of a nonzero polynomial, we
see that the coefficients ai,j,ℓ must all be zero. Since the Jacobson radical is the
intersection of the annihilators of all the simple A-modules, it too must be zero. 

   Let us examine in detail when a down-up algebra A(α, β, γ) has infinitely many
simple Verma modules. Since the Verma module V (λ) is simple if and only if λn 6= 0
for all n ≥ 1, the analysis requires the expressions for λn in Proposition 2.12.
Case 1. α2 + 4β 6= 0. Here λn = c1 r1n + c2 r2n + xn , (see Proposition 2.12 (i)), which
can be expressed as a polynomial in λ:
                            1                             
                  λn =           (r2 − α)r1n + (−r1 + α)r2n λ + bn ,
                         r2 − r1
where r2 − α = 1/2α − t − α = −r1 and −r1 + α = −1/2α − t + α = r2 . Thus the
coefficient of λ is (r2 − r1 )−1 (r2n+1 − r1n+1 ). If this is 0, then r1n+1 = r2n+1 , which
implies (α+τ )n+1 = (α−τ )n+1 where τ = 2t and τ 2 = α2 +4β. Since τ 2 = α2 +4β 6=
28                          GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

0, α + τ and α − τ are unequal, and we may suppose one of them — say α + τ 6= 0.
                            n+1
Then 1 = (α + τ )−1 (α − τ )      , so in fact both are nonzero, and the same holds
true if α −τ 6= 0. We may suppose (α +τ )−1 (α −τ ) = eiθ where θ = 2πk/(n +1) for
some 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Then α − τ = (α + τ )eiθ gives α(eiθ − 1) = −τ (eiθ + 1). Squaring
that relation shows that α2 = −β(eiθ + e−iθ )2 = −4β cos2 (θ/2). Consequently,
λn is a degree 1 polynomial in λ except when α2 = −4β cos2 (θ/2) where eiθ is an
(n + 1)st root of unity.
Case 2. α2 + 4β = 0 and α 6= 0. In this case λn = c1 sn + c2 nsn + xn = (n +
1)sn λ + bn , where s = α/2. Thus, λn is a degree 1 polynomial in λ for all n.
Case 3. α2 + 4β = 0 and α = 0 (so β = 0). Here λn = γ for all n ≥ 1.
Proposition 3.4. If
     (a) α2 + 4β 6= 0 and α2 6= −4β cos2 (θ/2) for some root of unity eiθ ,
     (b) α2 + 4β = 0 and α 6= 0, or
     (c) α = 0 = β and γ 6= 0,
then A(α, β, γ) has infinitely many simple Verma modules V (λ).


   Proof. In the cases described in (a) and (b), each λn can be regarded as a
line λn = mn λ + bn with nonzero slope mn . Each such line intersects the line
y = 0 at one value of λ. Avoiding all those countably many values by choosing λ
appropriately, we get infinitely many simple Verma modules V (λ). 

Proposition 3.5. A down-up algebra A = A(α, β, γ) is Z-graded, A = ⊕n An ,
where An = spanC {ui (du)j dk | i, j, k = 0, 1, . . . , and i − k = n}, and A0 is a
commutative subalgebra.


   Proof. The free associative algebra over C generated by d and u can graded
by assigning deg(d) = −1 and deg(u) = 1 and extending this by using deg(ab) =
deg(a)+deg(b). The relations d2 u = αdud+βud2 +γd and du2 = αudu+βu2 d+γu
are homogeneous, so the down-up algebra inherits the grading.
   To prove that A0 is commutative, we first show that ui (du)j di commutes with
du and ud for all i, j. This is true if i + j ≤ 1 by (2.11). Suppose we know the result
for all i + j < N , and let i + j = N ≥ 2. Consider (ui (du)j di )(ud). Now if i = 0 this
equals (ud)(ui (du)j di ) since ud and du commute. If i = 1, then u(du)j d = (ud)j+1 ,
which commutes with ud. So we may assume that i ≥ 2. Then


        (ui (du)j di )(ud) = ui (du)j di−2 (αdud + βud2 + γd)d
                        = αu2 (ui−2 (du)j di−2 )(du)d2 +
                               βu2 (ui−2 (du)j di−2 )(ud)d2 + γui (du)j di    while

           (ud)(ui (du)j di ) = u(αudu + βu2 d + γu)(ui−2 (du)j di )
                            = αu2 (du)(ui−2 (du)j di−2 )d2 +
                                   βu2 (ud)(ui−2 (du)j di−2 )d2 + γui (du)j di .

These two expressions are equal by our induction hypothesis. Analogously, we
consider (ui (du)j di )(du), where we can suppose that i ≥ 1. Then


   (ui (du)j di )(du) = ui (du)j di−1 (αdud + βud2 + γd)
                    = α(ui (du)j di )(ud)+
                           βu(ui−1 (du)j di−1 )(ud)d + γui (du)j di       which equals

            (du)(ui (du)j di ) = (αudu + βu2 d + γu)(ui−1 (du)j di )
                              = α(ud)(ui (du)j di )+
                                     βu(ud)(ui−1 (du)j di−1 )d + γui (du)j di

by what we have already established.
   The proof of the proposition will be complete once we show that ui (du)j di com-
mutes with uk (du)ℓ dk for all i, j, k, ℓ. This is true if i + j ≤ 1 or if i or k is ≤ 1 by
our previous considerations, so we assume it is true when i + j + k + ℓ < N and
prove it for i + j + k + ℓ = N . We suppose i, k ≥ 2. Now


  (ui (du)j di )(uk (du)ℓ dk ) = ui (du)j di−2 (αdud + βud2 + γd)uk−1 (du)ℓ dk

The center of a down-up algebra.

   Let Z(A) = {z ∈ A | za = az for all a ∈ A} denote the center of a down-up
algebra A = A(α, β, γ).
                                  P
Proposition 3.6. Suppose A = j∈Z Aj is the Z-grading of A = A(α, β, γ) as
in Proposition 3.5, and assume that A has infinitely many simple Verma modules.
Then:
   (a) The center Z(A) of A is contained in A0 = spanC {ui (du)j di | i, j = 0, 1, . . . }.

     (b) If z ∈ Z(A) and V (λ) is any Verma module of A, then z acts as a scalar,
     say χλ (z), on V (λ). The mapping χλ : Z(A) → C is an algebra homomorphism.
     (c) A scalar π ∈ C is linked to λ if π = λn+1 for some n ≥ 0 with λn = 0,
     where the sequence λ1 , λ2 , . . . is constructed using the recurrence relation in (2.1)
     starting with λ−1 = 0 and λ0 = λ. If π is linked to λ, then χπ = χλ .


    Proof. Consider the sequence λ = λ0 , λ1 , λ2 , . . . from (2.1), and let Λ(λ) =
{n ∈ Z≥0 | λn = 0}. Suppose v0 , v1 , . . . is the canonical basis for V (λ) as in
Proposition 2.2,Pand let z ∈ Z(A). From dz · v0 = zd · v0 = 0 we see that z ·
v0 = χλ (z)v0 + n∈Λ(λ),n>0 an vn for some scalars an and χλ (z). Therefore, when
λ 6= 0 and V (λ) is simple (i.e. when Λ(λ) = ∅) then z · v0 = χλ (z)v0 . But
za · v0 = az · v0 = χλ (z)a · v0 for all a ∈ A, and since V (λ) = Av0 , this shows that
z acts as the scalar χλ (z) on such P Verma modules. Now write z as a sum of its
homogeneous components, z = j zj , z ∈ Aj . Then since Aj vn ⊆ Cvj+n for all
j, n, and since zvn = χλ (z)vn for all n when V (λ) is simple, it must be that zj for
j 6= 0 lies in the annihilator of V (λ). But the intersection of the annihilators of the
simple V (λ) modules is zero by Theorem 3.3. Thus, z = z0 ∈ A0 , as claimed in (a).
Once we know that, then it follows for any Verma module V (λ) that z ·v0 = χλ (z)v0
for some scalar χλ (z) ∈ C. As before using V (λ) = Av0 , we see z acts as χλ (z)
on all of V (λ). As χλ (zz ′ )v0 = zz ′ · v0 = z · (z ′ v0 ) = χλ (z)χλ (z ′ )v0 , it is clear χλ
is an algebra homomorphism. Part (c) is apparent also, since when λn = 0, then
spanC {vj | j ≥ n + 1} is a submodule of V (λ) isomorphic to V (λn+1 ). 

                               §4. Category O modules


   The representation theory of finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras
centers on a certain important collection of weight modules, the so-called category O
modules, whose study was initiated by Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand [BGG]. In
this section we define an analogous category of modules for each down-up algebra
A = A(α, β, γ). We begin with a general result about weight vectors and then
specialize to the modules in O and derive some results about them.

Proposition 4.1. Suppose M is an A-module and m ∈ M is a vector of weight
ν = (ν ′ , ν ′′ ).
     (a) Then u · m is a vector of weight µ = (µ′ , µ′′ ) for µ′ = αν ′ + βν ′′ + γ and
     µ′′ = ν ′ .
     (b) If β 6= 0, then d · m is a vector of weight δ = (δ ′ , δ ′′ ) where δ ′ = ν ′′ and
     δ ′′ = β −1 (ν ′ − αν ′′ − γ).


     Proof. The assertions are evident from the following calculations:

(ud)d · m = β −1   d(du) · m − αd(ud) · m − γd · m = β −1 ν ′ − αν ′′ − γ d · m. 

(4.3) The category O consists of all A-modules M satisfying the following condi-
tions:
                                                                    L
   (a) M is a weight module relative to h = spanC {du, ud}, i.e. M = ν Mν where
   Mν = {m ∈ M | h · m = ν(h)m for all h ∈ h};
   (b) d acts locally nilpotently on M , so that for each m ∈ M , dn · m = 0 for some
   n.
   (c) M is a finitely generated A-module.
    The category O is closed under taking submodules and quotients. It contains
all the Verma modules V (λ) and their simple quotient modules L(λ) = V (λ)/M (λ)
                                                                              def
(and in the case that γ = 0 and λ = 0, the one-dimensional quotients L(0, ξ) =
V (0)/N (x−ξ) (see Corollary 2.28)). Modules in the category O enjoy some of the
same basic properties as the category O modules for complex semisimple Lie alge-
bras and for the algebras studied by Smith [Sm].

(4.4) Suppose ω = (ω ′ , ω ′′ ), where ω ′ , ω ′′ ∈ C. Let Ω(ω) denote the set weights
defined inductively starting with ω0 = (ω0′ , ω0′′ ), where ω0′ = ω ′ and ω0′′ = ω ′′ , and
proceeding for n ≥ 1 by setting ωn = (ωn′ , ωn′′ ) where

                               ωn′ = αωn−1
                                       ′       ′′
                                           + βωn−1 +γ
                               ωn′′ = ωn−1
                                       ′
                                           .

Note that ωn′ = αωn−1 ′          ′
                           + βωn−2  + γ for n ≥ 2. When ω = (λ, 0) then ωn =
(λn , λn−1 ), where λn is as in Proposition 2.1. Thus Ω(ω) is just the set of weights
of the Verma module V (λ) in the particular instance that ω = (λ, 0).

Lemma 4.5. Suppose β 6= 0. Assume M is an object in the category O, and let
Ω(M ) = {ν ∈ h∗ | Mν 6= (0)} be the set of weights of M . Then there exists a finite
set of weights ω 1 , . . . , ω r so that Ω(M ) ⊆ ∪i Ω(ω i ).


  Proof. Because M is finitely generated,
                                   P       there exists a finite set of weight vectors
m1 , . . . , mℓ generating M . Then j C[d]mj is finite-dimensional, and moreover it
32                             GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

is h-invariant for h = spanC {du, ud} by Proposition 4.1. So we can choose a basis
y1 , . . . , yr for it such that yi has some weight ω i for each i. Then by Theorem 3.1,

             X            X                            X                     X
        M=        Amj =          C[u]C[du]C[d]mj =          C[u]C[du]yi =            C[u]yi .
              j            j                            i                        i


The vectors in C[u]yi have weights in Ω(ω i ) by Proposition 4.1, so the relation
Ω(M ) ⊆ ∪i Ω(ω i ) is apparent. 

Lemma 4.6. Suppose β 6= 0. If M is a simple object in the category O, then
M ∼= L(λ) for some λ, or γ = 0 and M ∼
                                     = V (0)/N (x−ξ) = L(0, ξ) for some ξ ∈ C
(as in Corollary 2.28).


   Proof. It follows from the local nilpotence of d and from Proposition 4.1 that
M contains some highest weight vector v0 . The simplicity of M forces M = Av0
so that M is a highest weight module. As highest weight modules are quotients of
Verma modules, M is as asserted. 


                                 §5. Category O′ modules


   In this section we introduce and investigate a more general category of modules
for the down-up algebra A = A(α, β, γ). We require throughout that β 6= 0.

(5.1) The category O′ consists of all A-modules M satisfying the following condi-
tions:
     (a) M is a weight module relative to h = spanC {du, ud}
     (b) C[d]m is finite-dimensional for each m ∈ M .
     (c) M is a finitely generated A-module.
   The modules in O clearly belong to O′ , but we will show later that O′ is larger
than O by determining the simple modules in O′ . Two mappings on weights play
a prominent role in these investigations.

   Recall (Proposition 4.1) that if a vector m in an A-module has weight ν = (ν ′ , ν ′′ )
relative to h, then d · m has weight


                   δ(ν) = (δ(ν)′ , δ(ν)′′ )     where
(5.2)
                  δ(ν)′ = ν ′′      and       δ(ν)′′ = β −1 (ν ′ − αν ′′ − γ),

and u · m has weight
                                 DOWN-UP ALGEBRAS                                      33




                    µ(ν) = (µ(ν)′ , µ(ν)′′ )      where
(5.3)
                   µ(ν)′ = αν ′ + βν ′′ + γ       and         µ(ν)′′ = ν ′ .

An easy direct computation shows that δ(µ(ν)) = ν and µ(δ(ν)) = ν, (or this can
be readily seen from the fact that (du) · m = ν ′ m and (ud) · m = ν ′′ m). Observe
that the set of weights Ω(ω) in (4.4) alternately can be described as


(5.4)                       Ω(ω) = {µk (ω) | k = 0, 1, . . . }.


The set of weights of the lowest weight module W (κ) is just {δ k (ω) | k = 0, 1, . . . },
where ω = (0, κ).

Theorem 5.5. Suppose F is a set of weights such that δ(ω), µ(ω) ∈ F whenever
ω ∈ F . Suppose ρ ∈ C is nonzero, and let N (F, ρ) be the C-vector space with basis
{vω | ω ∈ F }.
   (a) Define


                                d · vω = ρvδ(ω)
(5.6)
                                u · vω = ρ−1 µ(ω)′′ vµ(ω) .

   Then this action extends to give an A(α, β, γ)-module action on N (F, ρ).
   (b) If F is generated by any weight ν = (ν ′ , ν ′′ ) ∈ F under the action of δ and
   µ, and if ν ′ 6= 0 for any ν ∈ F , then N (F, ρ) is a simple A(α, β, γ)-module.

   Proof. Let N (F, ρ) be as in the statement of the theorem, and define an action
of the free associative algebra Chd, ui on N (F, ρ) using (5.6). Then


                   (du) · vω = ρ−1 µ(ω)′′ d · vµ(ω) = µ(ω)′′ vω = ω ′ vω
(5.7)
                   (ud) · vω = ρu · vδ(ω) = µ(δ(ω))′′ vω = ω ′′ vω .

Utilizing (5.7) together with (5.2) and (5.3), it is easy to see that

                                                         
  d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd · vω = ρ ω ′ − αω ′′ − βδ(ω)′′ − γ vδ(ω) = 0
                                                                 
     2            2               −1      ′′      ′      ′     ′′
  du − αudu − βu d − γu · vω = ρ µ(ω) µ(ω) − αω − βω − γ vµ(ω) = 0.

Thus, there is an induced action making N (F, ρ) into an A(α, β, γ)-module.
34                          GEORGIA BENKART, TOM ROBY

   Now suppose F is generated by any weight ν ∈ F under the maps δ and µ defined
in (5.2) and (5.3). It follows from (5.7) that N (F, ρ)
                                                      Pis a weight module. Let M be
a nonzero submodule of N (F, ρ), and assume v = ω aω vω is a nonzero vector in
M . Since any submodule of a weight module is a weight module, vω ∈ M if aω 6= 0.
Now whenever vω ∈ M for some ω, then d · vω = ρvδ(ω) and u · vω = ρ−1 µ(ω)′′ vµ(ω)
both belong to M . Since µ(ω)′′ = ω ′ 6= 0 for any ω ∈ F by assumption, vµ(ω) ∈ F .
Because F is generated by ω under δ and µ, M contains vτ for all τ ∈ F . As a
consequence, M = N (F, ρ) and N (F, ρ) is a simple A(α, β, γ)-module. 

   Suppose now that M is a simple module in the category O′ . If M contains a
highest weight vector, then M is as in Lemma 4.6. So we may assume henceforth
that M has no highest weight vectors. Let m be a nonzero weight vector in M and
consider the finite-dimensional space C[d]m. If dk · m = 0 for some k, then dk−1 · m
is a highest weight vector in M contrary to assumption. It must be that d acts
nonnilpotently on C[d]m. Let v be an eigenvector of dP    in C[d]m corresponding to
nonzero eigenvalue, say d · v = ρv, ρ 6= 0. Write v = ω vω where vω belongs to
the weight space Mω .
   Since d · v = ρv, it must be that d · v has the same number of weight components
as v. Equating corresponding components on both sides of the equation gives


(5.8)                                 d · vω = ρvδ(ω) .

Thus if S is the C-span    of the weight components vω of v, then dS = S. Now
ρu · v = (ud) · v = ω ω ′′ vω , which implies that
                   P



(5.9)                            u · vω = ρ−1 µ(ω)′′ vµ(ω) .

Thus, S is an A(α, β, γ)-submodule of M . By simplicity, S = M .
     Since there are only finitely many nonzero weight component summands, δ ℓ (ω) =
δ k (ω) for some ℓ > k. Applying µk to both sides, we see δ (ℓ−k) (ω) = ω. Thus,
there is some smallest value p so that δ p (ω) = ω and vω , vδ(ω) , . . . , vδp−1 (ω) are
all nonzero. Their C-span S ′ is invariant under d. Using (5.9) and the fact that
µ(δ i (ω)) = δ i−1 (ω) for i ≥ 1 and µ(ω) = µ(δ p (ω)) = δ p−1 (ω), we see that uS ′ ⊆ S ′
also. Thus, M = S ′ by simplicity. The set F = {ω, δ(ω), . . . , δ p−1 (ω)} is δ and
µ-invariant. Any weight in it generates the whole set under δ and µ. Now suppose
ν is a weight of F and ν ′ = µ(ν)′′ = 0. Setting vn = ρn vδn (ν) for n = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1,
we have u · v0 = 0, d · vn = vn+1 for 0 ≤ n ≤ p − 1, and d · vn = ρp v0 . In this case
M is a finite-dimensional lowest weight module – a quotient of W (κ) for κ = ν ′′ .
The sole remaining possibility is that ν ′ 6= 0 for any ν ∈ F . In this situation
M = N (F, ρ), (and N (F, ρ) is in fact a simple module - compare Theorem 5.5 (b)).

     Let us summarize what we have shown:
                                  DOWN-UP ALGEBRAS                                     35

Theorem 5.10. Assume M is a simple module in the category O′ . Then there are
three possibilities:

  (a) M is a highest weight module, that is, M is isomorphic to L(λ) for some λ
  or to L(0, ξ) for some ξ ∈ C (when γ = 0).

  (b) M is a finite-dimensional lowest weight module with weights ν, δ(ν), . . . , δ p−1 (ν)
  such that δ p (ν) = ν.

  (c) M is isomorphic to N (F, ρ) for some ρ 6= 0 and some finite set F =
  {ν, δ(ν), . . . , δ p−1 (ν)} such that δ p (ν) = ν.


  We conclude this section by analyzing the special case that the set F is cyclically
generated by ω = (λ, κ) under δ and µ, and the weights in

                     F = {. . . , µ2 (ω), µ1 (ω), ω, δ(ω), δ 2(ω), . . . }

are all distinct. Observe that if we define λn by first setting λ0 = λ and λ−1 = κ
and proceeding by

                   λn = αλn−1 + βλn−2 + γ                for n ≥ 1
                            −1
                  λ−n = β        (λ−n+2 − αλ−n+1 − γ)            for n ≥ 2,

then

                            (λn , λn−1 ) = µn (ω)         for n ≥ 0
                                              n
                         (λ−n , λ−n−1 ) = δ (ω)           for n ≥ 1.

These are just the weights of the doubly-infinite module V (κ, λ) in Proposition
2.33. It is easy to see using Proposition 2.35 that there is an isomorphism from the
dual module V (κ, λ)∗ to N (F, 1) taking vn∗ 7→ vµn (ω) for n ≥ 0 and v−n∗
                                                                           7→ vδn (ω)
                                          ′
for n ≥ 1. Theorem 5.5 shows that if ν = λn 6= 0 for any ν = (λn , λn−1 ), n ∈ Z,
then N (F, 1) ∼= V (κ, λ)∗ is simple. This forces V (κ, λ) to be simple as well, for
the annihilator in V (κ, λ)∗ of any proper submodule of V (κ, λ) would be a proper
submodule of V (κ, λ)∗ . Consequently, an analogue of the result in Proposition 2.4
holds for the doubly-infinite module V (κ, λ):

Proposition 5.11. Suppose λ0 = λ and λ−1 = κ and define the sequence λn as
in Proposition 2.33. If λn 6= 0 for any n, then the doubly-infinite module V (κ, λ)
is simple.

          §6. One-dimensional A(α, β, γ)-modules and isomorphisms

     Consider a one-dimensional space X = Cx with

                           d · x = ax     and      u · x = bx.
Then this extends to a module for A = A(α, β, γ) if and only if


             0 = (d2 u − αdud − βud2 − γd) · x = a (1 − α − β)ab − γ x
                                                                    

             0 = (du2 − αudu − βu2 d − γu) · x = b (1 − α − β)ab − γ x.
                                                                    


   If a = 0 = b, then X = V (0)/M (0). We may suppose that not both a, b are 0,
so that X is an A-module if and only if (1 − α − β)ab = γ holds. When γ = 0
and α + β = 1, then any choice of a and b gives X the structure of an A-module,
so the one-dimensional A-modules are parametrized by C2 in this instance. When
γ = 0 and α + β 6= 1, then either a = 0 or b = 0 must hold. The one-dimensional
A-modules are parametrized by {(a, 0) | a ∈ C} ∪ {(0, b) | b ∈ C} in this case.
When γ 6= 0, we may suppose that γ = 1. ¿From (1 − α − β)ab = γ = 1, we see
that b = a−1 (1 − α − β)−1 . Thus, the one-dimensional A-modules are parametrized
by C for γ 6= 0 and α + β 6= 1, and by a = 0 = b when γ 6= 0 and α + β = 1.
   Now (du) · x = abx = (ud) · x, so that x has weight ν = (ab, ab) for all one-
dimensional A-modules X. When β 6= 0, then δ(ν) = (ab, β −1 (ab − αab − 1),
which equals (ab, ab) when γ = 1. Thus, in the case β 6= 0, γ 6= 0 the one-
dimensional module X is isomorphic to N (F, a) where F = {ν = (ab, ab)} and
δ(ν) = ν (compare Theorem 5.10). To summarize we have:

Theorem 6.1. The one-dimensional modules for the down-up algebra A(α, β, γ)
are parametrized by
     (a) C2 when γ = 0 and α + β = 1;
     (b) {(a, 0) | a ∈ C} ∪ {(0, b) | b ∈ C} when γ = 0 and α + β 6= 1;
     (c) C when γ 6= 0 and α + β 6= 1;
     (d) (0, 0) when γ 6= 0 and α + β = 1.

Corollary 6.2. If the down-up algebras A(α, β, γ) and A(α′ , β ′ , γ ′ ) are isomorphic,
then either both α + β and α′ + β ′ are equal to 1 or both are different from 1, and
either both γ and γ ′ are 0 or both are different from 0.

   Proof. The result is a simple consequence of Theorem 6.1 and the fact that if
φ : A(α, β, γ) → A(α′ , β ′ , γ ′ ) is an isomorphism, then any one-dimensional module
X = Cx for A(α′ , β ′ , γ ′ ) becomes one for A(α, β, γ) by defining t · x = φ(t) · x for
all t ∈ A(α, β, γ). 

    Open Problems. In conclusion we mention some noteworthy open questions
 concerning down-up algebras which are not addressed here. Problems (a)-(f) were
 posed in [B], and since the original version of this paper appeared, several of these
 problems have been solved.

(a) Determine when the algebra A(α, β, γ) is Noetherian. Kirkman, Musson, and
    Passman [KMP] have recently proven that A(α, β, γ) is left and right Noetherian
    if and only if β 6= 0 if and only if du and ud are algebraically independent.
(b) Find conditions on α, β, γ for A(α, β, γ) to be a domain.     When β = 0, then
    d(du−αud−γ1) = 0 so that A(α, β, γ) has zero divisors for any choice of α, γ ∈ C.
    It has been shown in [KMP] that A(α, β, γ) is a domain if and only if β 6= 0 (i.e
    if and only if the conditions in (a) hold.) It has been proved independently by
    Kulkarni [K2] (using methods from hyperbolic rings) that β 6= 0 is a necessary
    and sufficient condition for A(α, β, γ) to be a domain.
(c) Compute the center of A(α, β, γ).    This has been solved in a very recent
    preprint by Zhao [Z] and announced by Kulkarni [K2].
(d) Determine when A(α, β, γ) is a Hopf algebra.        The mapping S(d) = −d,
    S(u) = −u, which is an algebra antiautomorphism (in fact, the antipode) in
    the enveloping algebra case, is an algebra antiautomorphism of A(α, β, γ) if and
    only if β = −1 or β = 1 and α = 0 = γ.
(e) Relate Kulkarni’s presentation of the maximal left ideals in conformal sl2 algebras
    to the simple modules in category O and category O′ .        The approach in [K1]
    using noncommutative algebraic geometry is quite different from the one adopted
    here and so is the description of the simple modules. Our primary focus here
    was on determining explicit information about the representations of down-up
    algebras that could be used in the study of posets in the spirit of the work of
    Stanley [St1] and Terwilliger [T].
(f) Study the homogenization A[t] of the down-up algebra A = A(α, β, γ), which is
    the graded algebra generated by d, u, t subject to the relations

              d2 u = αdud + βud2 + γdt2 ,    du2 = αudu + βu2 d + γut2 ,
                                dt = td,     ut = tu.
    Homogenized sl2 is a positively graded Noetherian domain and a maximal order,
    which is Auslander-regular of dimension 4 and satisfies the Cohen-Macaulay
    property. Le Bruyn and Smith [LS] have determined the point, line, and plane
    modules of homogenized sl2 and shown the line modules are homogenizations of
    the Verma modules.
(g) Investigate indecomposable and projective modules for down-up algebras.
(h) Determine when two down-up algebras are isomorphic.         Some information on
    this problem is derived in Section 6 as a consequence of the determination of the
    1-dimensional modules, but we do not address the general problem here.
