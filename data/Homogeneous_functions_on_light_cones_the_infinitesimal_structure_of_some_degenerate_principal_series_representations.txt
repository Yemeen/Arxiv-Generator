                                                                                    1. Introduction
                                               One of the classic and most pleasing calculations in the representation theory of
                                            semisimple Lie groups is Bargmann’s [Ba] (see also [Na]) description of the structure
                                            of representations of SL(2, R). Bargmann constructs a basis of eigenvectors for the
                                            compact subgroup SO(2) ⊆ SL(2, R) and then explicitly describes the action of
                                            the Lie algebra of SL(2, R) on this basis. From the straightforward and explicit
                                            formulas that result, it is easy to make conclusions about unitarity, irreducibility,
                                            isomorphism, and other natural questions concerning these representations.
                                               Unfortunately Bargmann’s example stands almost alone; the literature tends
                                            to give the impression that once beyond the civilized confines of SL(2, R), one
                                            immediately finds oneself in a dense thicket of difficulties, where explicit calculation
                                            is difficult and of little value. The purpose of this paper is to point to an infinite
                                            class of examples in which the pleasant characteristics of Bargmann’s work can be
                                            retained; one can describe a model for representations in which the action of the
                                            Lie algebra is given by explicit simple formulas, which permit direct determination
                                            of important structural properties of the representations.
                                               The examples we will treat are spaces of functions that live on light cones and
                                            satisfy appropriate homogeneity conditions. These spaces are modules for an ap-
                                            propriate isometry group—O(p, q), U(p, q), or Sp(p, q). In case q = 1, the spherical
                                            principal series are among our examples, and Kostant’s celebrated results [Ko] on
                                            the complementary series can be read off from our formulas, excluding the one ex-
                                            ceptional rank one group. (Essentially this calculation was done, in less systematic
                                            fashion, in [Jo, JW].)
                                               We are hardly the first to study these representations. Significant parts of our

Ni, Sa, Sp1, Tk, Vi] are already in the literature. The paper [Br] has diagrams
that resemble some of ours. The unitary duals of the rank one groups have been
classified (see [BS, Cl, Hi1, Hi2] and the references therein). In fact, most or all of
our results may be in the literature, at least implicitly. The main purpose of the
present paper is to make our results explicit and to emphasize how concrete and
how simple a picture one may draw of these representations. We use virtually no
technology. There is no clear reason why these calculations could not have been
done in the 1940s or early 1950s. If they had been, the development of semisimple
representation theory might have been substantially different. For instance, besides
the results of Kostant mentioned above, it is easy to read off from our results the
unitary duals of O(2, 1), O(4, 1), and U(2, 1). The last of these was not known until
the mid 1960s [Hi2].
   Here is a summary of the paper. In §2 we set the context and describe our
representations in the case of the indefinite orthogonal groups O(p, q). We describe
the K-spectrum of the representations, where K = O(p) × O(q) is the maximal
compact subgroup of O(p, q), and we compute the infinitesimal action of the Lie
algebra o(p, q) in terms of the K-spectrum. On the basis of the formulas for the
o(p, q) action, we determine composition series for our representations. It turns
out that the structure of the composition series involves some integrality conditions
which make it depend in a significant way on the parities of p and q. Also, we must
distinguish the cases when p or q is less than or equal to 2, since these involve some
degeneration in the K-spectrum that affects the representation structure.
   In §3 we apply our formulas to determine which of our representations carry
invariant Hermitian forms, and on which subquotients these forms can be definite,
that is, which constituents of our representations are unitary. In particular, we
determine the extent of the complementary series and what happens at the end of
the complementary series.
   In §§4 and 5 we adapt the discussion of §§2, 3 to the unitary groups U(p, q) and
the indefinite symplectic groups Sp(p, q). The overall features of the picture for
these groups is controlled by O(p, q), as is made clear by Lemmas 4.1 and 5.3, but
differences in the K-spectrum in the degenerate cases when q = 1 lead to interesting
new phenomena, notably considerable variation in the length of the complementary
series, including Kostant’s results concerning the spherical complementary series of
U(p, 1) and Sp(p, 1).
   In order not to distract from the coherence and directness of the phenomena
that we present, we omit the details of various calculations in §§2–5. These are
worked out in §6. The final §7 discusses how our results fit into the general theory
of representations of semisimple Lie groups.
   To conclude this introduction, we note that those readers who are familiar with
the theory of reductive dual pairs [Ho3] will find our results can be profitably
interpreted in terms of this theory, which can be used to predict much of what
we present. We emphasize again, however, that our elementary and computational
approach is independent of this or any general theory (except that we use [Ho3] as
a convenient reference for facts about spherical harmonics that must somewhere be
in the classical literature).

To fix ideas, we will take p ≥ q. We consider Rp+q to be endowed with the indefinite
inner product
                                                            p

                                                                             X

                                                            j=1              j=1

We will use the notation
                                       2
                                      rp,q (w) = (w, w)p,q

and likewise for rp2 (x), rq2 (y).
   Let O(p, q) denote the isometry group of (·, ·)p,q ; that is, O(p, q) is the subgroup
of linear transformations g ∈ GL(p + q, R) such that
                       (gw, gw′ )p,q = (w, w′ )p,q ,         w, w′ ∈ Rp+q .
Clearly the group O(p), the isometry group of (·, ·)p on Rp , can be regarded as a
subgroup of O(p, q) by letting it act on the x component of w = (x, y). Similarly,
O(q), the isometry group of (·, ·)q on Rq , can be considered a subgroup of O(p, q).
Combining these, we get an embedding of O(p)×O(q) ⊆ O(p, q), as the subgroup of
O(p, q), which stabilizes the decomposition Rp+q ≃ Rp ⊕ Rq implicit in the notation
w = (x, y). The group O(p) × O(q) is clearly a compact subgroup of O(p, q). It is
well known and not hard to see that O(p) × O(q) is a maximal compact subgroup
of O(p, q).
   Let Mm,n (F ) denote the space of m × n matrices over a field F ; if m = n,
we shall abbreviate Mm,m (F ) by Mm (F ). We denote by o(p, q) the Lie algebra of
O(p, q), the space of (p+ q)× (p+ q) matrices T ∈ Mp+q (R), which are generators of
one-parameter subgroups {esT | s ∈ R} of O(p, q). By differentiating the relation
                                (esT w, esT w′ )p,q = (w, w′ )p,q ,
we obtain the description

Observe that we exclude the origin from X 0 .
   The action of O(p, q) on Rp+q preserves the light cone X 0 . It is well known (in
particular, it is a direct consequence of Witt’s Theorem [Ja]) that X 0 consists of
a single orbit for O(p, q), that is, the action of O(p, q) on X 0 is transitive. Thus if
w1 is a specified point in X 0 and Q1 ⊆ O(p, q) is the subgroup that stabilizes w1 ,
then the map g → gw1 defines a bijection (in fact, a diffeomorphism)
                                  α : O(p, q)/Q1 ≃ X 0 .
  Let P1 ⊆ O(p, q) be the stabilizer of the line Rw1 through w1 . Then P1 is a
parabolic subgroup [Kn] of O(p, q), and α(P1 ) = R× w1 ; more precisely, the map
p → α̃(p) where pw1 = α̃(p)w1 defines a group isomorphism
(2.3)                               α̃ : P1 /Q1 ≃ R× .
The second description of X 0 in (2.2) allows us to analyze the action of O(p) × O(q)
on X 0 . Let
                              Sp−1 = {x ∈ Rp | (x, x)p = 1}
be the unit sphere in Rp . It is a homogeneous space for O(p). We have on X 0 an
analog of “polar coordinates”.

                                     rp (x)     rq (y)

is a diffeomorphism. The level sets of rp2 (x) are O(p) × O(q) orbits, equivalent via
a scalar dilation to Sp−1 × Sq−1 .
   The action of O(p, q) on Rp+q can be used to define an action of O(p, q) on
functions on Rp+q by the familiar formula
(2.5)             ρ(g)(f )(w) = f (g −1 w),     g ∈ O(p, q), w ∈ Rp+q ,
for a function f on Rp+q . Precisely the same formula defines an action on functions
on any set X ⊆ Rp+q that is invariant under O(p, q). Furthermore, the restriction
mapping rX : f → f1 taking a function f to its restriction to X, clearly commutes
with the O(p, q) action. This means that if we have a function f on X, we can
compute ρ(g)(f ) by extending f to some function f˜ on all of Rp+q , computing
ρ(g)(f˜), then restricting back to X. This compatibility justifies at least partially
our abuse of notation in failing to specify on what set f is defined in formula (2.5).
We will be interested in taking X = X 0 , the light cone.

   If we differentiate the action (2.5) along one-parameter subgroups of O(p, q), we
obtain a representation of the Lie algebra o(p, q) on functions via differential oper-
ators. Straightforward computation shows that the space of operators representing
o(p, q) is spanned by the first-order operators:

Here the kjk  describe the action of the Lie subalgebra o(p) ⊆ o(p, q) corresponding

to the subgroup O(p) of O(p, q). Similarly the klm      describe the action of o(q). The
pjl span a complement to o(p) ⊕ o(q) in o(p, q), corresponding to the off-diagonal
matrix B in formula (2.1). We denote the span of the pjl by p.
   We propose to study spaces of homogeneous functions on the light cone X 0 .
Thus for a ∈ C denote by S a (X 0 ) the space
           S a (X 0 ) = f ∈ C ∞ (X 0 ) f (tw) = ta f (w), w ∈ X 0 , t ∈ R×

of smooth functions on X 0 homogeneous of degree a under dilations by positive
scalars. Since O(p, q) commutes with scalar dilations, it is clear that S a (X 0 ) will
be invariant under the action (2.5) of O(p, q). Indeed there is no need to consider
only positive dilations. We could further define two subspaces
                                 n                              o
                    S a± (X 0 ) = f ∈ S a (X 0 ) f (−w) = ±f (w) .
                                                

It is clear that
(2.8)                       S a (X 0 ) = S a+ (X 0 ) ⊕ S a− (X 0 )
and that each of S a+ (X 0 ) and S a− (X 0 ) are individually invariant under O(p, q).
Thus it would be possible, and might seem advisable, to study the S a+ (X 0 ) and
the S a− (X 0 ) separately. However, we will find it convenient and enlightening to
lump S a± (X 0 ) together in the space S a (X 0 ).
   Before proceeding to explicit computations, we observe that the spaces S a± (X 0 )
are naturally identifiable as O(p, q) modules to certain induced representations, of a
type known informally as “degenerate principal series”. Recall the homomorphism
α̃ : P1 → R× of formula (2.3). For a ∈ C, and a choice ± of sign, define a
quasicharacter (= homomorphism to C× ) of P1 by
                                 (
                          ±         α̃(p)a         if α̃(p) > 0,
(2.9)                   ψa (p) =             a
                                    ± |α̃(p)|      if α̃(p) < 0.
Define a map
(2.10)                           δ : S a± (X 0 ) → C ∞ (G)
by the formula
                          δ(f )(g) = ρ(g)(f )(w1 ) = f (g −1 w1 ).
6                             R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


Here w1 ∈ X 0 is the point used to define P1 .
  Straightforward formal checking shows that

                  δ(f )(pg) = ψa± (p)−1 δ(f )(g) ,      p ∈ P1 , g ∈ G,
(2.11)
                 δ(f )(gh) = δ(ρ(h)f )(g) .
These formulas, plus the definition of P1 , imply that δ defines an equivalence of
O(p, q) representations between S a± (X 0 ) and the representation indG        ± −1
                                                                          P1 (ψa )  in-
                                ± −1
duced from the character (ψa )        of P1 [Kn]. (Here we are using unnormalized
induction.) If q = 1 and we choose + from ±, these representations are the spheri-
cal principal series of O(p, 1) [Kn].
   Now let us investigate the structure of the S a (X 0 ) as O(p, q) modules. First
consider the action of the compact subgroup O(p) × O(q). The decomposition
(2.4) of X 0 shows that any function in S a (X 0 ) is determined by its restriction to
β −1 (Sp−1 × Sq−1 × {1}). More exactly, restriction to β −1 (Sp−1 × Sq−1 × {1}) of
elements of S a (X 0 ) defines an isomorphism of O(p) × O(q) modules.
   The classical theory of spherical harmonics [Ho3, Vi, Zh] describes C ∞ (Sp−1 ) as
a representation of O(p). It is the (topological) direct sum of the finite-dimensional
spaces Hm (Rp ) consisting of the (restrictions to Sp−1 of the) harmonic polynomials
of degree m, m ∈ Z+ ;
                                             X
(2.12)                         C ∞ (Sp−1 ) ≃    Hm (Rp ).
                                              m≥0

The space Hm (Rp ) consists of polynomials of degree m which are annihilated by
the Laplace operator
                                            p
                                           X   ∂2
                                    ∆p =            .
                                           j=1
                                               ∂x2j

Let P m (Rp ) denote the space of polynomials of degree m on Rp . Then the Laplace
operator maps P m (Rp ) to P m−2 (Rp ); that is,

(2.13)                       ∆p : P m (Rp ) → P m−2 (Rp ),
with kernel Hm (Rp ). It is part of the theory of spherical harmonics that the map-
ping (2.13) is surjective; hence

                   dim Hm (Rp ) = dim P m (Rp ) − dim P m−2 (Rp )
                                                           
                                    m+p−1           m+p−3
                                =                −                .
                                      p−1              p−1
If p > 1, this is always nonzero, but if p = 1, it is zero for m ≥ 2. Thus although
the sum (2.12) always is nominally over all of Z+ , for p = 1, it is effectively only
over m = 0, 1. Each Hm (Rp ) defines an irreducible representation of O(p), and the
representations defined by two different Hm (Rp ) are inequivalent.
   Combining the decompositions (2.12) for p and for q, we obtain a decomposition
                                          X

of the functions on Sp−1 × Sq−1 into irreducible inequivalent subspaces for O(p) ×
O(q). The above remarks about restriction to β −1 (Sp−1 × Sq−1 × {1}) show that
equation (2.14) also yields a description of the O(p) × O(q)-module structure of
S a (X 0 ). The main point to observe is that we can adjust the homogeneity of
functions by multiplication by powers of rp2 (or rq2 ) without changing the way they
transform under O(p) × O(q). Thus we can define an embedding

(2.15)               ja,m,n = ja : Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ) → S a (X 0 )

by the formula

                        ja (h1 ⊗ h2 )(x, y) = h1 (x)h2 (y)rp2 (x)b ,

where h1 ∈ Hm (Rp ), h2 ∈ Hn (Rq ), and b is chosen so that the total degree of
homogeneity is a, that is, m + n + 2b = a. In formula (2.15) we are implicitly
restricting h1 h2 rp2b to X 0 . The following statement summarizes our discussion of
the O(p) × O(q) action.


Lemma 2.2. As an O(p)×O(q) module, the space S a (X 0 ) decomposes into a direct
sum
                                       X
(2.16)                 S a (X 0 ) ≃           ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ))
                                      m,n≥0


of mutually inequivalent irreducible representations.


   We will refer to the spaces ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )) as the K-types of S a (X 0 ).
We remind the reader that in case p (or q) equals 1, the sum over m (or n) is limited
to m (or n) equal to 0 or 1.
   Lemma 2.2 tells us the structure of S a (X 0 ) as an O(p) × O(q) module. Since the
K-types all define distinct O(p)×O(q) subrepresentations, any O(p)×O(q)-invariant
subspace of S a (X 0 ) will be a sum of the K-types it contains. This will in particular
be true of any O(p, q)-invariant subspace of S a (X 0 ). Thus, to understand the
O(p, q)-module structure of S a (X 0 ), we need to see how O(p, q) transforms one K-
type to another. For this purpose, it is helpful to represent the K-types graphically,
as points in the plane R2 . Precisely, we will represent ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )) as the
point with integer coordinate (m, n) in the positive quadrant (R+ )2 in R2 . Thus the
set of all K-types is matched to the set of all integer points in the positive quadrant,
as illustrated by Diagram 2.17 (see next page). (This picture is for p, q ≥ 2, which
we will assume for the present. We will treat the degenerate case q = 1 later.) We
have used two different symbols to mark the points to remind the reader of the
decomposition of S a (X 0 ) into S a± (X 0 ). The dots indicate K-types in S a+ (X 0 )
(the parity of m + n is even), and the crosses indicate K-types in S a− (X 0 ) (the
parity of m+ n is odd). Sometimes we will indicate a K-type ja (Hm (Rp )⊗ Hn (Rq ))
simply by its associated coordinates (m, n).

    To go beyond the K-type structure of S a (X 0 ), we will investigate the effect of
applying elements from the subspace p of the Lie algebra o(p, q) to the K-types.
Since the K-types are individually invariant under o(p) ⊕ o(q), any collection of
K-types such that any one of them is mapped by p into the span of the others will
define (i.e., its span will be) an o(p, q) submodule of S a (X 0 ). An early theorem of
Harish-Chandra [HC2] guarantees that the closure of this span in S a (X 0 ) will be an
O(p, q) submodule. Thus our computation of the action of p on individual K-types
is in principle (and will turn out to be in practice) sufficient for understanding the
submodule structure of S a (X 0 ).
    The operators of p are described in the formula (2.6). A computation, which
will be carried out in §6.1, establishes the following rules.
Lemma 2.3. For each pair (m, n), there are maps
            ±,±
           Tm,n : p ⊗ (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )) → Hm±1 (Rp ) ⊗ Hn±1 (Rq ),
which are independent of a and which are nonzero as long as the target space is
nonzero, such that the action of z ∈ p on the K-type ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )) is
described by the formula
                                          ++
              ρ(z)ja (φ) =(a − m − n)ja (Tmn (z ⊗ φ))
                                                     +−
                           + (a − m + n + q − 2)ja (Tmn (z ⊗ φ))

                           + (a + m − n + p − 2)ja (Tmn (z ⊗ φ))

where φ ∈ Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ).
Proof. See §6.1.


   In terms of the graphical representation (see Diagram 2.17) of the K-types, we
may picture this formula as follows. Starting from a given point (m, n), the action
of p potentially can take us to any of the diagonally adjacent points (m ± 1, n ± 1).
Whether we can, in a given S a (X 0 ), actually proceed from (m, n) to a given one of
                                                                                  ±±
the points (m ± 1, n ± 1) depends on whether the coefficient of the operator Tmn

the situation graphically as in Diagram 2.19.

   The four corner points in Diagram 2.19 are the K-types we may hope to reach
from (m, n) by the action of p; whether we actually can get to a given one of the
points depends on whether the transition coefficient A±±

is nonzero. We shall omit the subscripts in A±±
                                             p,q,a if it is clear from context.

Remark . We see that from a given (m, n) by arbitrarily repeated action of p we
can never hope to get to all other points (m′ , n′ )—only to those such that m′ + n′
has the same parity as m + n. This reflects the fact, already observed, that S a (X 0 )
breaks up into the two invariant subspaces S a± (X 0 ).
    We see that if a is not an integer, then the transition coefficients A±± are never
zero for any (m, n) in (Z+ )2 . From this and Diagram 2.19, we see that, starting
from any K-type ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )), we may by sufficiently many applications
of elements from p eventually reach any other K-type corresponding to (m′ , n′ ),
providing m′ + n′ has the same parity as (m, n). Combining this with the de-
scriptions (2.17), we can make our first conclusion concerning reducibility of the
S a (X 0 ).
Proposition 2.4. If a is not an integer, then each of S a± (X 0 ) is an irreducible
O(p, q) module.
  Consider now what happens when a is an integer. Suppose a ≥ 0, and consider
a K-type (m, n) such that m + n = a. This means A++ = 0, so we cannot
move from (m, n) to (m + 1, n + 1) by acting by p. We can perhaps move to
(m′ , n′ ) = (m + 1, n − 1) or to (m′ , n′ ) = (m − 1, n + 1), but from these points we
again cannot move to the upper right, as seen in terms of Diagram 2.19 since again
10                           R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


m′ + n′ = a. We can see that the action of p, no matter how many times repeated,
will never take us above the line m + n = a. Thus the set of K-types (m, n) with
m + n ≤ a and m + n ≡ a(mod 2) form an o(p, q) submodule of S a (X 0 ).

   We interpret this using our graphical representation of K-types as follows. We
think of the line a = x + y in R2 as being a barrier, which moves as a varies. When
this moving line passes through integer points in the positive quadrant, it blocks
attempts to move past it from those K-types (of the correct parity); thus, trapping
all K-types below it in an o(p, q) submodule. This is illustrated by Diagram 2.21.

   Similar reasoning applies to each of the transition coefficients A±± . Each of
them can be thought of as defining a line in R2 , namely, the set of (x, y) ∈ R2 that
satisfy A±± (x, y) = 0. We will abuse notation and use the symbol A±± to refer
to the line or barrier defined by the zero locus of the linear functional A±± (x, y)
defined in (2.20). These lines move as a varies, and when they pass through integer
points (which they all do simultaneously, when a is an integer), they trap the K-
types on one side and so give rise to a submodule. The position of these barriers
for a typical a > 0 is given in the Diagram 2.22.

   The arrows on each barrier point in the direction of the submodule defined by
the barrier. Observe that the barriers A++ and A−− are parallel and the associated
arrows point in opposite directions. Likewise the barriers A+− and A−+ are parallel
to each other and perpendicular to the other two. As a varies, the barriers A++
and A+− move so that they intersect the x-axis at points q − 2 units apart, and
the barriers A++ and A−+ always intersect the y-axis at points p − 2 units apart.
Thus A++ never intersects A+− or A−+ inside the positive quadrant unless p or q
equals 2. Also, the barriers A++ and A−− never intersect the positive quadrant at
the same time. They coincide when a = 2 − p+q     2 . The barriers A
                                                                       +−
                                                                          and A−+ also
coincide at this value of a. For 0 > a > −p − q + 4, neither of the barriers A++ or
A−− intersects the positive quadrant.
   All submodules of S a (X 0 ) are accounted for by the barriers A±± and by the
decomposition (2.8). The interactions between these effects yield several patterns
of reducibility according to the parities of p and q. The details are quite easy to work
out. We will summarize the results, with diagrams illustrating typical situations.
   The main point to consider is which of the barriers A±± affect S a+ (X 0 ) and
which affect S a− (X 0 ). For example, suppose (m, n) ∈ (Z+ )2 satisfies A++ (m, n) =
0 while another point (m′ , n′ ) ∈ (Z+ )2 satisfies A+− (m′ , n′ ) = 0. Then

                     (m + n) − (m′ + n′ ) =a − (2m′ − a − q + 2)
                                            =2(a − m′ − 1) + q.

Hence the parity of (m + n) − (m′ + n′ ) is the same as the parity of q. Thus if q is
even, the barriers A++ and A+− both affect the same module of the pair S a± , but
if q is odd, one of the barriers affects S a+ , and the other affects S a− . Similarly, the
pair of barriers A++ and A−+ affects the same module if p is even and different
12                           R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


ones if p is odd. Also A+− and A−+ affect the same or different modules according
as p + q is even or odd.
   We describe the various possibilities with a collection of diagrams with commen-
taries. In all the diagrams below, the arrows on the barriers point toward the region
of K-types that define a submodule.
Case OO: p odd, q odd. In this situation, the barriers A+− and A−+ affect the
same one of the S a± (X 0 ) and A++ or A−− affects the other. For the record, we
note that A+− and A−+ affect S aε (X 0 ) when ε = (−1)a+1 , while A++ and A−−
affect S aε (X 0 ) when ε = (−1)a . We describe the submodule structure for various
ranges of values of a.
   (i) a ≥ 0. Here the module affected by the barriers A+− and A−+ decomposes
into three components: one irreducible submodule and two irreducible quotients,
all infinite dimensional, illustrated by Diagram 2.23.

coalesce, and there is a submodule consisting of K-types supported on the line
y = x + (p − q)/2 and two quotient modules consisting of the K-types on one side
or the other of this line (see Diagram 2.25).

Case OE: p odd, q even. In case OE, the barriers A+− and A++ affect one of
S a± (X 0 ), and the barriers A−+ and A−− affect the other one. For the record,
A+− and A++ affect S aε (X 0 ) if ε = (−1)a , while A−+ and A−− affect S aε (X 0 ) if
ε = (−1)a+1 . Here is the description of submodule structure in various ranges of
the value of a.
  (i) a > 0. Here the module affected by A++ and A+− has three constituents:
one finite-dimensional subrepresentation, one infinite-dimensional quotient, and one
subquotient in between, as illustrated by Diagram 2.30.

Case OE.


Case EE: p even, q even. When p and q are both even, all the possible bar-
riers affect the same one of S a± (X 0 ) (i.e., S aε (X 0 ) if ε = (−1)a ), and the other
is irreducible. The discussion and diagrams below will treat only the reducible

tation, two quotients, and one subquotient in between, as illustrated by Diagram

                                   Diagram 2.35


Remarks. (a) Although there are considerable variations in the submodule struc-
ture of S a (X 0 ) according to the parities of p and q, there is always a total of five
constituents for a > 0, one of which is finite dimensional.
   (b) The extra complexity when p + q is even of the submodule structure in the
range −[(p + q)/2] + 2 ≥ a ≥ −[(p + q)/2 will acquire additional significance in §3
where unitarity is investigated.
   (c) Although we have only described the constituents of S a (X 0 ) as “finite dimen-
sional” or “infinite dimensional”, the Diagrams 2.23, 2.28, 2.34, and 2.35 certainly
suggest that the constituent “in the middle” is smaller than the constituents “in the
wings”. This difference in size could be made precise in terms of Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension [Vo1] or N -spectrum [Ho2].

Degenerate cases p ≥ q = 1. We will now indicate how the case of q = 1 differs from
the picture developed above and also make some supplementary remarks about the
case q = 2, which is also somewhat exceptional.
   When q = 1, the light cone X 0 is not connected. We can divide it into two
relatively open and closed pieces X 0± , called nappes, defined by

                          X 0± = {(x, y) ∈ X 0 | y = ±|x|}.

(Note that y is just a real number when q = 1.) The two nappes X 0± of the
light cone are each stabilized by a subgroup O+ (p, 1) of index 2 in O(p, 1). We
see that any element of S a± (X 0 ) is determined by its restriction to X 0+ . Fur-
thermore the function sign on X 0 , which takes the values ±1 on X 0± , is clearly
invariant under O+ (p, 1) and is an eigenfunction of O(p, 1). Evidently multiplying
by sign gives an O+ (p, 1)-module isomorphism between the S a± (X 0 ). Thus when
q = 1, analyzing S a (X 0 ) as an O(p, 1) module is essentially the same as analyz-
ing S a+ (X 0 ) ≃ S a (X 0+ ) as an O+ (p, 1) module. We will do this, following an
abbreviated version of our agenda for the case of O(p, q), p, q > 1.

  The map

                                     +,             β(x, y) = (x/y, y),

where x ∈ Rp − { 0 } and y = rp2 (x)1/2 ∈ R×
                                           + , is a diffeomorphism. The maximal
compact subgroup of O+ (p, 1) is O(p), which acts transitively on the set {(x, 1) ∈
X 0+ } ≃ Sp−1 . We can define embeddings
(2.37)    ja,m = ja : Hm (Rp ) → S a (X 0+ ),         ja (h)(x, y) = h(x)y a−m .
Note that since y > 0 on X 0+ , complex powers of y make sense. From decomposi-
tion (2.36) and the theory of spherical harmonics, we know that the decomposition
of S a (X 0+ ) as an O(p) module is
                                          X
                            S a (X 0+ ) ≃   ja (Hm (Rp )).

The principles behind this calculation are discussed in §6.1. It follows easily that
S a (X 0+ ) is always irreducible except when a is an integer, with either a ≥ 0 or
a ≤ −p + 1, in which case S a (X 0+ ) has two constituents, one of which is finite
dimensional. In what we hope will be a self-evident analogy with the situation for
q > 1, we illustrate this by Diagram 2.38.

    Although the general picture presented in Diagrams 2.23–2.35 is valid when
q = 2, this case is also somewhat exceptional. Although the Hn (R2 ) are nonzero
for all n ≥ 1, their dimensions, instead of growing with n, remain fixed at 2 (for
n = 0, Hn (Rq ) is the trivial representation for all q and has dimension 1). More
significantly, whereas the representations Hn (Rq ), n ≥ 1, q ≥ 3, of O(q) remain
irreducible when restricted to the special orthogonal group SO(q), the representa-
tions Hn (R2 ), n ≥ 1, decompose into two one-dimensional representations when
restricted to SO(2), which is isomorphic to T, the unit circle. This suggests that
one consider varying the picture presented above by restricting the representations
S a (X 0 ) to the identity component O0 (p, q) of O(p, q). For p, q ≥ 3 this has no
effect. When q = 2 (and p > 2), however, the pictures presented above for O(p, 2)
must be “folded out” along the x-axis to yield pictures appropriate for O0 (p, q).
Precisely the Diagrams 2.30, 2.31, and 2.33 now should look as in Diagrams 2.39,
2.40, and 2.41 respectively.

   We observe that in Diagram 2.22, the gap between the points where A++ and
 +−
A     intersect the x-axis is q − 2, so when q = 2, these points coincide, and so when
reflected across the x-axis, these barriers make crossing straight lines. Similar
remarks apply to A−− and A−+ .
   If p is even, then the relevant diagrams are 2.34 and 2.35. The modified version
of Diagram 2.34 is Diagram 2.42.

   We omit the diagram corresponding to Diagram 2.35, which would be dual to
Diagram 2.42. The main effect of the restriction is that representations that have
no K-types along the x-axis, that is, that contain no fixed vectors for O(2), break
up into two summands symmetrically placed across the x-axis. However, represen-
tations whose K-type region includes part of the x-axis remain irreducible. Rein-
forcing this splitting is the fact that when q = 2, the barriers A++ and A+− (and
the barriers A−− and A−+ ) intersect on the x-axis, leaving no gap for K-types
of the intermediate constituent in Diagram 2.30. Hence this constituent becomes
two on restriction to O0 (p, 2). The representations of O0 (p, 2) whose K-types are
restricted to only one side of the x-axis are of the type known as holomorphic or
highest weight modules [EHW, Br].
   If p = 2 and q = 2, then Diagram 2.42 should be further folded out along the
y-axis. Since O(2, 2) is just isogenous to SL(2, R) × SL(2, R), we will not dwell on
this example.


                                     3. Unitarity
   In this section we will investigate which of the subquotients of the S a (X 0 ) de-
scribed in §2 can define unitary representations, that is, possess an O(p, q)-invariant
positive-definite Hermitian form. As with the calculations of submodule structure,
the results are primarily based on the formulas of Lemma 2.3 for the action of
p ⊆ o(p, q).
   Since the K-types ja (Hm (Rp )⊗Hn (Rq )) are irreducible modules for the compact
group O(p) × O(q), each one admits an O(p) × O(q)-invariant Hermitian inner
product, and this is unique up to multiples. For this discussion we will fix an inner
product h·, ·im,n on each space Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ) by the geometric recipe
                                         Z
(3.1)                  hφ1 , φ2 im,n =                φ1 (z)φ2 (z) dz,
                                         Sp−1 ×Sq−1

where φj ∈ Hm (Rp )⊗Hn (Rq ) and dz indicates the O(p)×O(q)-invariant probability
measure on Sp−1 × Sq−1 . We will push forward this inner product by ja to obtain
an inner product on the K-type ja (Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq )). We call the collection of
inner products so obtained the standard inner products on the K-types.
   If h·, ·i is an O(p, q)-invariant Hermitian form on S a (X 0 ) (or on some constituent
of S a (X 0 )), the restriction of h·, ·i to any K-type must be a multiple of the standard
                             DEGENERATE PRINCIPAL SERIES                               23


inner product on that K-type:
(3.2)                       hja (f1 ), ja (f2 )i = cm,n hf1 , f2 im,n ,
where fj ∈ Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ) and cm,n is an appropriate real number, which must
be positive if h·, ·i is to be positive definite. Furthermore the K-types must be
mutually orthogonal, so that h·, ·i is determined by the numbers cm,n .
   According to an early theorem of Harish-Chandra [HC2], a positive-definite inner
product h·, ·i on S a (X 0 ) will be O(p, q) invariant if and only if the operators from
o(p, q) are formally skew adjoint with respect to h·, ·i. Equation (3.2) guarantees
this will be so for operators from o(p)⊕o(q). Thus to determine invariance of h·, ·i we
just need to check skew-adjointness of the operators from the subspace p ⊆ o(p, q).
From formulas (2.18) and (3.2), we see that this amounts to the equations
                                       ++
          (a) 0 =(a − m − n)cm+1,n+1 hTm,n (z ⊗ φ), φ′ im+1,n+1

                     + (a + m + n + p + q − 2)cm,n hφ, Tm+1,n+1 (z ⊗ φ′ )im,n ,

          (b) 0 =(a − m + n + q − 2)cm+1,n−1 hTm,n (z ⊗ φ), φ′′ im+1,n−1
                                                −+
                     + (a + m − n + p)cm,n hφ, Tm+1,n−1 (z ⊗ φ′′ )im,n ,

where z ∈ p, φ ∈ Hm (Rp ) ⊗ Hn (Rq ), φ′ ∈ Hm+1 (Rp ) ⊗ Hn+1 (Rq ), and φ′′ ∈
Hm+1 (Rp ) ⊗ Hn−1 (Rq ). Here a means the complex conjugate of a.
  Equations (3.3) can be substantially simplified by an elementary observation,
which will be justified in §6.
Lemma 3.1. When Re a = −[(p + q)/2] + 1, that is, for a = −[(p + q)/2] + 1 + is,
s ∈ R, the Hermitian inner product which equals the standard inner product on
each K-type, is O(p, q) invariant.

Remark . More generally, one can show that if φ1 in formula (3.1) is taken to be-
                                           ′
long to S α (X 0 ) and φ2 is taken from S α (X 0 ), where α + α′ = 2 − (p + q), then
                                                                     ′
(3.1) defines an O(p, q)-invariant pairing between S α (X 0 ) and S α (X 0 ), which are
thus canonically mutual Hermitian duals. This duality explains the symmetry in
structure among the S α (X 0 ), as discussed in §2.
Proof. See §6.1.
     If we take a = −[(p + q)/2] + 1 in formula (3.3), we see that Lemma 3.1 implies
            ++                             −−
      (a) hTmn (z ⊗ φ), φ′ im+1,n+1 = hφ, Tm+1,n+1 (z ⊗ φ′ )im,n ,
            +−                              −+
      (b) hTmn (z ⊗ φ), φ im+1,n−1 = hφ, Tm+1,n−1 (z ⊗ φ′′ )im,n
                         ′′

for all possible choices of z, φ, φ′ , φ′′ as in (3.3). Given these relations, a reinspec-
tion of formulas (3.3) shows they are equivalent to the purely numerical equations
            (
              (a − m − n)cm+1,n+1 + (a + m + n + p + q − 2)cm,n = 0,
              (a − m + n + q − 2)cm+1,n−1 + (a + m − n + p)cm,n = 0
or
                (
                    A++ (m, n)cm+1,n+1 + A−− (m + 1, n + 1)cm,n = 0,

   Let us explore the implications of equations (3.4). Consider first the case when
the S a± (X 0 ) are irreducible. Then the quotient
                                   m+n−a
                                a+m+n+p+q−2
must at least be real for all possible choices of m and n. Setting
                                             p+q
                                  ã = a +       − 1,
                                              2
we can rewrite this ratio as
                   m + n + δ − ã   (m + n + δ − Re ã) − i Im ã
(3.5)                             =                               ,
                   m + n + δ + ã   (m + n + δ + Re ã) − i Im ã
where
                                         p+q
                                    δ=       − 1.
                                          2
It is easy to convince oneself that the ratio (3.5) can be real for large m, n only if
either Re ã = 0 or Im ã = 0. The case of Re ã = 0 is covered by Lemma 3.1. We
will call the set of a with Re ã = 0 the unitary axis. If Im ã = Im a 6= 0, we know
(see Proposition 2.4) that S a± (X 0 ) is irreducible; hence for it to be Hermitian,
expression (3.5) would have to be real for all m, n. This leads us to the following
conclusion.

Lemma 3.2. In order for S a (X 0 ) to have any Hermitian constituents, either a
must be on the unitary axis, or a must be real. Conversely, for a on the unitary
axis, S a (X 0 ) is unitary, and for a real, all components of S a (X 0 ) are Hermitian
(i.e., they possess an invariant Hermitian form).

   The final assertion follows from the observation that if a is real then we can
start at a given K-type (m0 , n0 ) in any constituent of S a (X 0 ), set cm0 ,n0 = 1, and
use equations (3.4) to determine cm,n for other K-types in that constituent. It
should be checked that this procedure is consistent, i.e., that it results in a well-
defined cm,n on each K-type. For this, it suffices to check that the transitions
around squares, like (m, n) −→ (m + 1, n + 1) −→ (m + 2, n) and (m, n) −→
(m + 1, n − 1) −→ (m + 2, n), predict the same value for the ratio of the start and
finish (here cm+2,n /cm,n ). This is a short computation. Here, as in the analysis of
irreducibility, it is germane to note that the transition coefficients A++ and A−−
are unchanged by the transitions (m, n) −→ (m, n) ± (1, −1); likewise A+− and
A−+ are unchanged under (m, n) −→ (m, n) ± (1, 1).
   Our goal is now to investigate for which constituents of S a (X 0 ) the process
described in the previous paragraph will yield positive values for all cm,n in the
constituent. Looking again at equations (3.4), we can easily see and formulate the
following rule.
Criterion 1. Let a be real. A given constituent of S a (X 0 ) is unitary if and only
if the ratios
                    A++ (m, n)                               A+− (m, n)
(3.6)      (i)                            and      (ii)
                 A−− (m + 1, n + 1)                       A−+ (m + 1, n − 1)

are negative for all pairs of K-types (m, n) and (m + 1, n + 1) or (m, n) and (m +
1, n − 1) contained in the constituent.


   We proceed to investigate the nature of this criterion in order to obtain an
explicit list of the unitary constituents.
   Consider again our graphical representation of the K-types as integer points in
the positive quadrant, together with barrier lines corresponding to the zeroes of the
linear functions A±± . We illustrate the situation for a typical a > 0 in Diagram
3.7.

   In this diagram we have indicated, for each transition coefficient, the side of
its barrier where it is positive and the side where it is negative. We see that, in
the positions illustrated, both A+− and A−+ are positive in the region between
their barriers and likewise for A++ and A−− . When a < 0 and the A+− barrier
is above the A−+ barrier, both A+− and A−+ are negative in the region between
barriers. In general, we may say that A+− and A−+ have the same sign in the
region between barriers, and have opposite signs in the regions outside the barriers,
similarly for A++ and A−− . Thus, if (m, n) and (m + 1, n − 1) both lie between the
A+− and A−+ barriers, or more precisely if (m, n) lies above the A+− barrier and
26                            R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


(m + 1, n − 1) lies below the A−+ barrier (or vice versa), then the ratio (3.6)(ii) is
positive and unitarity cannot hold. On the other hand, if (m, n) lies above the A+−
barrier and (m + 1, n − 1) also lies above the A−+ barrier (or both lie below), then
the transition from (m, n) to (m + 1, n − 1) is consistent with unitarity. Similar
remarks apply to the pair A++ , A−− .
   We can apply these considerations to determine the unitarity of constituents of
the S a (X 0 ). As for the discussion of submodule structure in §2, it is convenient to
distinguish cases according to the parities of p and q. Before beginning we note that,
using the notation ã as in formula (3.5), the same argument that establishes Lemma
3.1 shows that the modules S ã (X 0 ) and S −ã (X 0 ) are mutual Hermitian duals. This
will be shown in §6.1. It follows that in considering questions of unitarity, it will
suffice to take ã ≥ 0.


Case OO: p odd, q odd. From the unitary axis (ã = 0) until ã = [(p + q)/2] − 1
(i.e., a = 0), neither of the barriers A++ or A−− intersects the positive quadrant.
Hence unitarity depends only on the barriers A+− and A−+ . Their position when
ã = 0 is illustrated in Diagram 2.26. Let ε0 denote the choice of ± such that
S aε0 (X 0 ) is reducible at ã = 0, and let ε1 denote the other choice. For the record,
we note that ε0 is + if (p − q)/2 is odd and is − if (p − q)/2 is even.
    At ã = 0 none of the K-types of S aε0 (X 0 ) lie between the barriers A+− and A−+ ,
which are located on the two lines L±1 defined by equations y − x = [(p − q)/2] ± 1;
however, there are K-types lying on these two lines. As ã increases from 0, the
barrier A+− moves to the right and A−+ moves left. Hence, for 0 < ã < 2,
transitions between L1 and L−1 cross both barriers and so violate unitarity. For
ã ≥ 2, transitions between L1 and L−1 cross neither barrier and so again violate
unitarity. Hence the full module S aε0 (X 0 ) is never unitary when ã > 0, and at
points of reducibility the constituent with K-types between the barriers cannot be
unitary. The other two constituents, however, are easily seen to be unitary, since
all their transitions take place on the same side of both barriers.
    The module S aε1 (X 0 ) is irreducible at ã = 0 and remains so for 0 < ã < 1.
For this range of a, the only K-types between the barriers are those on the line L0
defined by y − x = (p − q)/2. One checks that transitions in either direction from
L0 are consistent with unitarity. At ã = 1 the barriers coincide on L0 (see Diagram
2.25), and the K-types on this line span a constituent of S aε1 (X 0 ). There are no
transitions transverse to the barriers from L0 , so this constituent is unitary; likewise
the other constituents are unitary, so all three are unitary. For ã > 1 the line L0 is
on the opposite side of the barriers A+− and A−+ , from where it was when ã < 1,
so the transitions from L0 violate unitarity. Hence unitarity for S aε1 (X 0 ) stops at
ã = 1. Also, for points of reducibility beyond ã = 1, the same reasoning applies as
to S aε1 (X 0 ).
    In the range a ≥ 0, when there may be a finite-dimensional component, one
easily checks that the trivial representation at a = 0 is unitary, but no other finite-
dimensional representations are so.
    In sum, the unitarity properties of the S a± (X 0 ) in this case are summed up in
Diagrams 3.8 and 3.9. For Diagram 3.9, we note that (a) and (b) depict S aε (X 0 )
when ε = (−1)a+1 , while (c) and (d) depict S aε (X 0 ) when ε = (−1)a .

                  Diagram 3.9. Unitarity at points of reducibility.

Case OE: p odd, q even. In this case, when ã = 0, the barriers do not pass
through integral points, so the representations S −δ± (X 0 ) are irreducible (recall
that δ = [(p + q)/2] − 1). Each has K-types between the barriers: one on the
28                            R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


line L1/2 defined by y − x = [(p − q)/2] + 12 and the other on the line L−1/2 ,
defined by y − x = [(p − q)/2] − 12 (see Diagram 3.10). As ã increases from 0,
the barriers approach these lines and coincide with them for ã = 21 . One checks
that for 0 < ã < 12 transitions from these lines is consistent with unitarity, but
as ã passes 21 , the barriers move past the lines L±1/2 , and then transition from
these lines does violate unitarity. Hence for ã > 21 , the full modules S ã± (X 0 ) can
no longer be unitary. At points of reducibility for ã > 12 , one can check that the
constituent with K-types to the right of A+− and the one with K-types to the left
of A−+ is unitary. Again the only unitary finite-dimensional unitary constituent is
the trivial representation. Diagrams 3.11 and 3.12 illustrate the main conclusions.
For Diagram 3.12, we note that A++ and A+− affect S aε (X 0 ) if ε = (−1)a , while
A−+ and A−− affect S aε (X 0 ) if ε = (−1)a+1 .

 Case EO: p even, q odd. This case is essentially the same as case OE. We will
 not give the details.

 Case EE: p even, q even. Here the discussion is essentially the same as for Case
 OO, except that, when a ≥ 0, at a point of reducibility, three barriers affect the

same S a± (X 0 ), and the other one is irreducible. We draw the pictures illustrating
this situation (see Diagrams 3.13(a) and (b)).

Remarks. (a) It is interesting to note that both summands S a± (X 0 ) of S a (X 0 )
“see” all the barriers via their Hermitian forms, whether or not these barriers cause
reducibility in one summand or the other. In fact, they see the barriers even when
the barriers do not pass through integral points at all.
    (b) The unitary representation with K-types distributed along a single line which
occurs at ã = 1 when p + q is even [see Diagram 3.9(a)] is particularly interesting.
It is paired with the trivial representation in the local correspondence for the dual
pair (O(p, q), SL(2, R)). It is the smallest possible nontrivial unitary representation
of O(p, q) and may be regarded as a “quantization of the minimal nilpotent orbit”
in the argot of geometric quantization [EPW]. It turns up in physics in connection
with the quantum Coulomb problem [Ab, AFR, DGN, Fr, On].
    (c) The representations S a+ (X 0 ) are “spherical” representations, meaning that
they contain the trivial representation of the maximal compact subgroup, and the
S a− (X 0 ) are nonspherical representations. Notice that, for each of these families or
“series” of representations, the only point on the unitary axis that can be reducible
is the point on the real axis, namely, ã = 0. When p + q is even, exactly one of the
two series is reducible at ã = 0, while when p + q is odd neither series is. The group
SL(2, R) has two principal series of representations, analogous to the S a± (X 0 ): one
spherical series and one nonspherical. The spherical series is irreducible on the real
axis, and the nonspherical series is reducible. Also, as was well known and has
been shown again here, the unitary spherical principal series for O(n, 1) is always
irreducible. These examples perhaps created some expectation that spherical series
were more likely to be irreducible than other series. In our example, however, when
p + q is even, either the spherical or the nonspherical series may be reducible at
ã = 0, according to the parity of (p − q)/2, while when p + q is odd, neither series
is reducible.
    We note also that when a is a positive integer, the trivial K-type is always
contained in the central strip where nonunitarity reigns. Thus outside the unitary

   The reason that the unitary representations can live so far off the unitary axis is
that since the K-types now live along a single line, the A+− and A−+ barriers no
longer affect unitarity—only the barriers which cut off finite-dimensional represen-
tations, and these do not come into play until the finite-dimensional representations
begin appearing at a = 0.




        4. The U(p, q)-module structure of homogeneous functions
                               on light cones

4.1. The U(p, q) modules S α,β (X 0 ). We now wish to adapt the analysis given
for O(p, q) in §§2 and 3 to the indefinite unitary groups U(p, q).
  Let Cp+q = Cp ⊕ Cq denote complex (p + q)-dimensional space, parametrized by
tuples (z, w), with z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zp ) in Cp and w = (w1 , w2 , . . . , wq ) in Cq . We
endow Cp+q with the Hermitian form


                                                                  p

                                                                                   X

of signature (p, q). Let U(p, q) ⊂ GL(p + q, C) denote the group of linear isometries
of the form (·, ·)p,q . Observe that the subgroup U(p) × U(q), which preserves the
z variables and the w variables, is a compact subgroup of U(p, q). (In fact, it is a
maximal compact subgroup.) Let

be the light cone or variety of null vectors. By Witt’s Theorem [Ja] or by elementary
means, one can see that U(p, q) acts transitively on X 0 . We wish to study the action
of U(p, q) on appropriate spaces of functions on X 0 .
   If we regard Cp+q as R2p+2q by means of coordinates xl , yl , where
                          zj = x2j−1 + ix2j ,       1 ≤ j ≤ p,
(4.2)
                          wk = y2k−1 + iy2k ,        1 ≤ k ≤ q,
then the real part of the form (·, ·)p,q becomes the indefinite inner product of
signature (2p, 2q), the light cone (4.1) is the same as the light cone for R2p+2q ,
and U(p, q) is identified to a subgroup of O(2p, 2q). Thus we are led to consider
the action of U(p, q) on the spaces S a± (X 0 ) defined by restriction of the action
of O(2p, 2q). These spaces, however, can clearly never be irreducible for U(p, q),
because U(p, q) commutes not simply with R× , the real scalar dilation operators
used to define the S a± (X 0 ), but with C× , the complex scalar dilations. (Indeed,
U(p, q) may be characterized as the subgroup of O(2p, 2q), which commutes with
C× .) Thus it is appropriate to break up the spaces S a (X 0 ) into subspaces that are
homogeneous for the action of C× (i.e., eigenspaces for C× ). We observe
                                                       
(4.3)                    C× ≃ R×                              ×
                                  + · T = {|t| · t/|t|  t ∈ C }.
                                                       

Here T = {s ∈ C× | |s| = 1} is the usual unit circle. Thus a character ψ of C× has
the form

(4.4)                  ψ(t) = |t|a (t/|t|)n ,     a ∈ C× , n ∈ Z.

Since |t| = (tt̄)1/2 where t̄ is the complex conjugate of t, we can formally write

(4.5)                           ψ(t) = ψ α,β (t) = tα t̄β ,
with α = (a + n)/2 and β = (a − n)/2 or a = α + β, and n = α − β. We see that a
pair (α, β) can occur in (4.5) if and only if α − β is an integer. For all such pairs, we
define S α,β (X 0 ) ⊆ S α+β (X 0 ) to be the ψ α,β eigenspace for C× . We clearly have a
decomposition
                                             X
(4.6)                          S a (X 0 ) =        S α,β (X 0 ).
                                          α+β=a
                                          α−β∈Z

Further each summand in equation (4.6) is obviously invariant under the group
U(p,q). We will study the representations of U(p,q) defined by the S α,β (X 0 ). We
remark that they can be interpreted as induced representations, again “degenerate
principal series”, just as the S a± (X 0 ) were interpreted as induced representations
of O(2p, 2q) (see formulas (2.9)–(2.11)). When n = 0 (or when α = β and only
then), the representations S α,β (X 0 ) will be spherical, that is, will contain a vector
invariant under the maximal compact subgroup U(p)× U(q) ⊆ U(p, q). When q = 1
and α = β, we have the spherical principal series of U(p, 1).
   To understand the U(p, q)-module structure of S α,β (X 0 ), we proceed as we did
for the S a (X 0 ): First we describe the action of the maximal compact subgroup
U(p) × U(q) and then we see how the noncompact part of the Lie algebra u(p, q) of
U(p, q) moves around the U(p) × U(q)-isotypic subspaces.

4.2. K-Structure of S α,β (X 0 ). Under the inclusion of U(p, q) in O(2p, 2q), it is
clear that U(p) × U(q) ⊆ O(2p) × O(2q). Since the O(2p) × O(2q)-module structure
of the S a (X 0 ) is described in terms of spherical harmonics (see formulas (2.12)–
(2.16)), we are led to consider the structure of the space Hm (Cp ) ≃ Hm (R2p ) as a
U(p) module.
   Consider the algebra PR (Cp ) ≃ P(R2p ) of polynomials on Cp considered as a
real vector space. We may choose the complex coordinates z1 , z2 , . . . , zp and their
complex conjugates z1 , z2 , . . . , zp as generators for PR (Cp ). For integers α, β, let
P α,β (Cp ) be the space of polynomials that are homogeneous of degree α in the zj
and homogeneous of degree β in the zj . This notation is consistent with that of
§4.1, in the sense that P α,β (Cp ) is the ψ α,β eigenspace for the action of C× on
PR (Cp ) by scalar dilations. Clearly we have a decomposition
                                              X
(4.7)                         PRm (Cp ) ≃          P α,β (Cp )
                                          α+β=m

of R-homogeneous polynomials of degree m into bihomogeneous polynomials of
appropriate bi-degrees.
   The Laplacian on Cp = R2p can be written
                                   2p          p
                                  X   ∂2      X     ∂2
                             ∆=         2 = 4             .
                                  j=1
                                      ∂xj     j=1
                                                  ∂zj ∂zj

From this formula it is clear that ∆ maps P α,β (Cp ) to P α−1,β−1 (Cp ). It follows
that the harmonic polynomials have a decomposition analogous to (4.7), namely,
                         X                             X
(4.8)       Hm (Cp ) =        Hm (Cp ) ∩ P α,β (Cp ) =      Hα,β (Cp ),
                         α+β=m                            α+β=m


where the second equation serves to define the Hα,β (Cp ). Since U(p) ⊆ O(2p)
commutes with C×, the spaces Hα,β (Cp ) will be invariant under the action of U(p)
on Hm (Cp ). Hence they define representations of U(p). It is known (see [Zh]; this is
also a special case of the general results of [Ho3]) that the Hα,β (Cp ) are irreducible
and mutually inequivalent U(p) modules. We note that, in particular, the spaces
Hα,β (Cp ) are eigenspaces for the group C× ∩ U(n) ≃ T of scalar unitary matrices;
the eigencharacter by which T acts on Hα,β (Cp ) is

(4.9)                              χα−β : z → z α−β .

If p ≥ 2, then Hα,β (Cp ) is nonzero for all α, β ≥ 0; however, when p = 1, only
Hα,0 (C) = Cz α and H0,β (C) = Cz β are nonzero. This degeneracy in the Hα,β (Cp )
when p = 1 leads to some interesting phenomena, which will be detailed later in
the paper (see §4.5).
   Next consider the action of U(p) × U(q) on the algebra PR (Cp+q ). Taking the
tensor product of equation (4.8) with its analog for Cq gives us a decomposition
                                     X
(4.10)      Hm (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (Cq ) ≃           Hm1 ,m2 (Cp ) ⊗ Hn1 ,n2 (Cq ).
                                    m1 +m2 =m
                                    n1 +n2 =n

The action of the scalar unitary matrices on the summand Hm1 ,m2 (Cp )⊗Hn1 ,n2 (Cq )
is via the character χr where r = m1 − m2 + n1 − n2 [see definition (4.9)]. Using
this, we can easily see that the maps ja,m,n of formula (2.15) split into maps
(4.11) jα,β,m1 ,m2 ,n1 ,n2 = jα,β : Hm1 ,m2 (Cp ) ⊗ Hn1 ,n2 (Cq ) → S α,β (X 0 ),
where
                       α + β = a,        α − β = m1 − m2 + n 1 − n 2 .
In this connection we observe that
                                            2p
                                            X             p

components of bidegree equally and so does not affect their difference.
   Combining formulas (2.16), (4.6), (4.10), and (4.11) yields the decomposition

      S α,β (X 0 ) =          jα+β (Hm (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (Cq )) ∩ S α,β (X 0 )

of S α,β (X 0 ) into irreducible U(p) × U(q) modules.
   From the final form of the decomposition, we see that the U(p) × U(q) compo-
nents of S α,β (X 0 ) form a three-parameter slice out of the full four-parameter family
of U(p) × U(q) representations that appear in PR (Cp+q ). We may refer to these
irreducible U(p) × U(q) modules as “K-types”. The middle form of the decomposi-
tion emphasizes the relation of these U(p) × U(q) modules and the O(2p) × O(2q)
modules of the first form of the decomposition. We see from formula (4.10) that
the U(p) × U(q) submodules in Hm (Cp ) × Hn (Cq ) can be parametrized by the pair
(m1 , n1 ), which varies in the integral points in a rectangle (see Diagram 4.14).

When q = 1, there are further restrictions, described in §4.5. For now, we assume
p, q > 1.
    To exploit the relation between the situation under study and the results of §§2
and 3, we will represent formulas (4.13) graphically as follows. We think of the
points (m, n) for which the inner sum in the middle line of (4.13) is non-empty
as being integral points in the plane. This gives us all points in a coset of the
“diamond lattice” in the positive quadrant and lying above the line x + y = |α − β|,
as illustrated by Diagram 4.16.

  We further think of the “line” of U(p) × U(q) modules in the inner sum of the
middle line of (4.13) as points in a “fiber” lying over the point (m, n) in Diagram

4.16. We call the region

                             {(x, y) | x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x + y ≥ |α − β|}
the K-type region.

4.3. Action of the noncompact part of u(p, q) on S α,β (X 0 ). Consider now
how the noncompact part of the Lie algebra u(p, q) acts on the U(p) × U(q) compo-
nents, as described in the preceding section. Since u(p, q) ⊆ o(2p, 2q), it must act
compatibly with Diagram 2.19, so the U(p) × U(q) modules in the fiber over (m, n)
must be taken to the fibers over (m ± 1, n ± 1); but since each fiber consists of
several U(p) × U(q) modules, we must calculate how the u(p, q) action affects the
various points in each fiber. To formulate this we observe that the complexified Lie
algebra u(p, q)C has a decomposition

(4.17)                        u(p, q)C ≃ (u(p) ⊕ u(q))C ⊕ p+ ⊕ p− ,

where p± are the eigenspaces for the adjoint action of the center of u(p) ⊕ u(q).
Concretely we have

                                             Diagram 4.19

   From Diagram 4.19, we see that, providing the transition coefficients A++ , A−−
are nonzero at (m, n) and (m + 1, n + 1) respectively, that is, providing that the
fibers over (m, n) and (m + 1, n + 1) belong to the same o(2p, 2q) constituent of
S α+β (X 0 ), application of an element of p+ followed by another from p+ moves a
given U(p) × U(q) module to its neighbor in the same fiber. Computations in §6.2
will show that by successive applications of (p+ )2 [or (p− )2 ] we can move from any
point in a fiber to any other. A similar analysis applies to transitions between
(m, n) and (m + 1, n − 1). This implies the result: The U(p, q)-module structure
of S α,β (X 0 ) is controlled by the O(2p, 2q)-module structure.

Theorem 4.2. Assume p, q ≥ 2. The image of S α,β (X 0 ) in any O(2p, 2q)-irreducible
constituent of S α+β (X 0 ) is an irreducible U(p, q) module.

   In other words, the extra degree of freedom in the U(p)×U(q) fibers has no effect
whatsoever on the U(p, q) composition series of the S α,β (X 0 ), except in so far as
some fibers may be empty. We may therefore read off the U(p, q) constituents of
the S α,β (X 0 ) from the corresponding results from O(2p, 2q) (see Diagrams 2.25–
28, 2.34, and 2.35), providing we take into account Diagram 4.16 describing the
nontrivial fibers for S α,β (X 0 ).

Corollary 4.3. S α,β (X 0 ) is reducible if and only if α, β ∈ Z, that is, if and only
if α + β ∈ Z and α + β ≡ α − β mod 2.

Proof. For reducibility, we need one of the transition coefficients (2.20) to vanish
for some (m, n) corresponding to a nonempty fiber of U(p) × U(q) modules. For
example, the coefficient A+−
                           2p,2q,α+β (m, n) [see definition (2.20)] will vanish if and
only if

                             α + β = m − n − 2(q − 1).
Since we know α − β ∈ Z, and m − n ≡ α − β mod 2, we see that α + β ∈ Z and
α + β ≡ α − β mod 2. This implies α, β ∈ Z. Conversely, if α, β ∈ Z, then we can
reverse the process to find (m, n) such that A+− (m, n) = 0, implying reducibility.
The same conclusion follows by considering A−+ , and A++ and A−− also cannot
cause reducibility unless α, β ∈ Z.
   To describe what happens when α and β are integers, we simply have to combine
the relevant diagrams from §2 with Diagram 4.16. The various possibilities are
described in the following series of diagrams.
   (i) α, β ∈ Z+ . When α, β are both nonnegative integers, the barriers A+− , A−+ ,
and A++ all intersect the K-type region and cause S α,β (X 0 ) to break into four
parts: one finite-dimensional subrepresentation, two quotients, and one constituent
that is neither a quotient nor a subrepresentation (see Diagram 4.20).

   (ii) α or β is negative, but α + β ≥ 1 − p − q.       Here the A++ barrier no
longer intersects the region of K-types, and there are at most three constituents,
all infinite dimensional. As α + β decreases while α − β remains fixed, the barriers
A+− and A−+ approach each other. When α and β are nonnegative, the point
where the A+− barrier leaves the K-type region, that is, the intersection of the
A+− barrier with the boundary of the K-type region, is on the x-axis. Similarly,
the barrier A−+ passes through the boundary on the y-axis. As α + β decreases,
A+− moves left and A−+ moves right. When α + β becomes sufficiently small
(precisely, when min(α, β) ≤ 1 − q), the barrier A+− leaves the K-type region
through the antidiagonal segment {x + y = |α − β| | x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0}. As α + β
40                             R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


continues to decrease, the point of exit of A+− moves up the antidiagonal segment
and finally (when max(α, β) ≤ 1−q) moves onto the y-axis. The barrier A−+ moves
in the opposite direction. Its point of exit crosses from the y-axis to the antidiagonal
segment when min(α, β) = 1 − p and further crosses from the antidiagonal to the
x-axis when max(α, β) = 1 − p. The two barriers meet when α + β = 2 − p − q;
their common point of exit from the K-type region is on the antidiagonal segment
if and only if |p − q| ≤ |α − β|. The real point on the unitary axis (see §4.4) is at
α + β = 1 − p − q. For a given value of α − β, exactly one of the values 2 − p − q and
1−p−q for α+β will be a point of reducibility. If the unitary point α+β = 1−p−q
is reducible, then S α,β (X 0 ) breaks into a sum of two irreducible representations, as
illustrated in Diagram 2.26. An illustrative situation among the several possibilities
detailed above is pictured in Diagram 4.21.

   (iii) α + β < 1 − p − q. In analogy with the remark following Lemma 3.1, the
                             ′ ′
modules S α,β (X 0 ) and S α ,β (X 0 ), where α + α′ = 1 − p − q = β + β ′ , are naturally
dual, so the structure of S α,β (X 0 ) when α + β < 1 − p − q is deducible from that
       ′ ′
of S α ,β (X 0 ) as described above.
4.4. Unitarity. The unitarity criteria (3.6) for O(2p, 2q) apply directly here and
the results are as summarized in Diagrams 3.7 and 3.13. The unitary axis is defined
by Re(α+β) = 1−p−q. The possibilities for the values of α+β where the full module
S α,β (X 0 ) is unitary are as illustrated in Diagram 3.8 (note that ã = α+β +p+q −1,
ε0 is + if p − q is odd, and ε1 is − if p − q is even). At a typical point of reducibility,
as in Diagrams 4.20 and 4.21, the one or two constituents in the central strip are
not unitary, while the constituents outside the barriers are unitary. Exceptions in
the range Re(α + β) ≥ 1 − p − q occur when α = β = 0, when the finite-dimensional
subrepresentation is the trivial representation, and when α + β = 2 − p − q, with
α, β ∈ Z, in which case all three components, one of which has K-types only along
the line y − x = p − q, are unitary. See Diagram 3.9(a).
4.5. The case of U(p, 1), p > 1. For U(p, 1), degeneration of the K-types leads
to a situation substantially more complex than what is pictured in Diagram 4.16.

Since the module structure and unitarity result from an interaction between the
K-types and the barriers, this change in K-type structure causes a corresponding
change in the module structure and unitarity.
   As noted in the discussion following formula (4.9), the only Ha,b (C) that are
nonzero are Hn,0 (C) and H0,n (C), n ∈ Z+ . Hence, instead of what is repre-
sented in Diagram 4.14 as a rectangle of K-types, we have only the K-types
corresponding to the right and left sides of this rectangle, and in a given space
S α,β (X 0 ) ∩ jα+β (Hm (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (C)), we will have at most two irreducible compo-
nents for U(p) × U(1).
  This leads us to the following construction. Let us write


                                   (
                                       Hn,0 (C),       n ≥ 0,
(4.22)                  Hn (C) =
                                       H0,−n (C),      n ≤ 0.



Further let us represent jα+β (Hm1 ,m2 (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (C)) by the point (m1 + m2 , n) in
R2 . Here m1 , m2 ∈ Z+ and n ∈ Z. Since



                     jα+β (Hm1 ,m2 (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (C)) ⊆ S α,β (X 0 ),



where



(4.23)                         α − β = m1 − m2 + n,



and the triple (m1 , m2 , n) is determined by the pair (m1 + m2 , n) together with
α − β, we see that each point (m1 + m2 , n) represents at most one K-type in
S α,β (X 0 ). Furthermore, if the point (m, n), m ∈ Z+ , n ∈ Z, does represent a
K-type of O(2p, 2q), then we must have



                        m1 = 12 (m − (n − (α − β))) ≥ 0,
(4.24)                  m2 = 21 (m + (n − (α − β))) ≥ 0, or
                         m ≥ |n − (α − β)|.



Conversely, as long as p > 1, this condition plus m + n ≡ α − β mod 2 guarantees
we can find m1 , m2 , and n so that jα+β (Hm1 ,m2 (Cp ) ⊗ Hn (C)) ⊆ S α,β (X 0 ) sits
over (m, n). Thus the K-type region for S α,β (X 0 ) is as depicted in Diagram 4.25.

                                  Diagram 4.25




Note that the x-intercept is no longer |α − β| but now is just α − β.



   When we add barriers to this picture to determine reducibility, we find that each
of the former barriers A±,± produces two barriers, one in its original position and
a second reflected through the x-axis. Since when q = 1 the barriers A++ and A+−
intersect on the x-axis, the reflection of one continues the other in a straight line.
The reflection of A−+ is A−− and vice versa. Thus, with barriers inserted, Diagram
4.25 is transformed into Diagram 4.26 (the shaded area is the K-type region).

                                         Diagram 4.26


  Study of Diagram 4.26 and similar ones yields the following conclusions when α
and β are integers.


Lemma 4.4. Suppose α, β ∈ Z. Consider the structure of S α,β (X 0 ).
    (a)   The   barrier   A++   causes   reducibility   when   β ≥ 0.
    (b)   The   barrier   A+−   causes   reducibility   when   α ≥ 0.
    (c)   The   barrier   A−+   causes   reducibility   when   β ≤ −p.
    (d)   The   barrier   A−−   causes   reducibility   when   α ≤ −p.


   Given this information, the simplest way to organize the description of the struc-
ture of S α,β (X 0 ) is by means of a picture describing the Hasse diagram of S α,β (X 0 )
in various regions of the (α, β)-plane (see Diagram 4.27). The diagram is symmetric
across the line α + β = −p because of the natural duality between S α,β (X 0 ) and
S −p−α,−p−β (X 0 ).

   Unitarity is determined again by the conditions (3.4). The main novel feature of
the case at hand is that some of the conditions are now vacuous because there are
no K-types corresponding to transitions that would prevent unitarity. Thus the
unitary axis occurs at α + β = −p. If also |α − β| < p, that is, if α and β are in
the central square of Diagram 4.27, then all barriers miss the K-type region, and
if α + β varies while α − β is fixed, the barriers continue to miss the whole K-type

region in the interval −2p + |α − β| < α + β < −|α − β|.
   Consequently, the representation remains irreducible and unitary for α + β in
this range. In other words, when |α − β| < p, the unitary point α + β = −p is
irreducible regardless of the parity of |α − β| and the complementary series extends
to a distance p − |α − β| on either side of the unitary axis:

   In particular when α − β = 0 [which is the case of the spherical principal series
of U(p, 1)], the complementary series extends all the way from the unitary axis
(α + β = −p) to α + β = 0, that is, α = β = 0, which contains the trivial
representation as its irreducible subrepresentation. This has been known since
Kostant [Ko].

        series of U(p, 1)

   At points of reducibility, some of the constituents may be unitary. When α, β ∈
Z+ , the “large” constituent that occupies the main part of the interior of the K-
type region is unitary and the constituents living along the boundary of the K-type
region are nonunitary (see Diagram 4.30).

   Exceptions arise, however, when a constituent consists only of K-types on the
boundary of the K-type region. In this case there are no transitions in the direction
transverse to the boundary, so the corresponding obstructions to unitarity do not
apply and the corresponding module is unitary. In Diagram 4.31 we describe this
phenomenon for α, β ≥ 0.

  Similar remarks apply to the other regions of (α, β) depicted in Diagram 4.27.

Concluding remarks. (a) The unitary representations with K-types along a bound-
ary line of the K-type region have received considerable attention in the literature
and are frequently called “ladder representations” [Ab, AFR, DGN, En, FR, SW].
   (b) Consider the region of the (α, β)-plane that is shaded in Diagram 4.32.
   For a given value of α − β ∈ Z, the complementary series consists of precisely
those values of (α, β) that fall inside the shaded region. It is well known that the
fundamental group of SU(p, 1) is Z. By considering representations of its universal
covering group, one can get a family of representations parametrized by (α, β) in
which α − β can be an arbitrary real number. It is perhaps plausible that the set
of (α, β) for which these representations are unitary is exactly the shaded region
(excluding its boundary). A. Koranyi (oral communication) has verified this for
SU(2, 1).

                                                                            Diagram 4.32

   (c) When |α−β| ≥ p, the K-type region contains a parallel pair of barriers (either
A+− , A−+ or A++ , A−− ) when α + β = −p is the real point on the unitary axis
and the complementary series is restricted to the same region as when p, q > 1 (see
Diagram 3.8). In this situation, however, we have the possibility that β ≤ −p, α ≥ 0
(or the reverse) so that at a point of reducibility, both the barriers A+− and A−+ (or
both of A++ and A−− ) intersect the K-type region and create submodules. These
are the upper left and lower right regions in Diagram 4.27. When this happens,
48                               R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


the constituents outside the barriers are unitary, and one of them (for example, the
region above the barrier A−+ when β ≤ −p ≤ α+β) will have K-types contained in
a diagonal strip of finite width (above A−+ and below the boundary of the K-type
region). Thus we obtain for U(p, 1) a family of “ladderlike” representations whose
K-types live not on a single diagonal line but in a diagonal strip. Also we should
note that when the real point on the unitary axis is reducible (i.e., when α − β ≡ 0
mod 2), the two constituents are very different: one is ladderlike, with K-types in
a finite strip, and the other has K-types ranging over a full quarter plane.

5. The Sp(p, q)-module structure of homogeneous functions on light
                                 cones
5.1. The Sp(p, q) modules Sja (X 0 ). Let H denote the algebra of quaternions,
and let Hp+q ≃ Hp ⊕ Hq denote the vector space over H consisting of tuples

                 ω = (u, v) = (u1 , . . . , up , v1 , . . . , vq ),    ul , vl ∈ H.

We consider Hp+q to be endowed with the indefinite Hermitian form
                                                           p
                                                           X                 q
                                                                             X
(5.1)           (ω, ω ′ )p,q = (u, u′ )p − (v, v ′ )q =           u′l ul −         vl′ vl .
                                                            l=1              l=1

Here x denotes quaternionic conjugate of x ∈ H. Also, since H is noncommutative
we should specify that we consider Hp+q as a right vector space over H. Specifically,
quaternionic scalar multiplication multiplies the coordinate of ω ∈ H on the right:

                ωh = (u1 h, u2 h, . . . , up h, v1 h, . . . , vq h),          h ∈ H.

This is the reason we write u′l ul rather than ul u′l in formula (5.1). With this
convention, the algebra End(Hp+q ) may be realized as the space of (p + q) × (p +
q) matrices with entries in H, acting on ω ∈ Hp+q by the usual rules of matrix
multiplication.
   Let

                      X 0 = ω ∈ Hp+q − {0}  (ω, ω)p,q = 0
                                                          	
(5.2)

be the light cone in Hp+q . If i, j and k = ij denote the standard quaternion units,
we can write

               ul = x4l−3 + ix4l−2 + j(x4l−1 + ix4l ) = z2l−1 + jz2l
and

               vl = y4l−3 + iy4l−2 + j(y4l−1 + iy4l ) = w2l−1 + jw2l .

We may use the xk and yk to identify Hp+q with R4p+4q or the zk and wk to identify
Hp+q with C2p+2q . Under these identifications the light cone X 0 is exactly the same
light cone as previously defined for R4p+4q or for C2p+2q .
   Let Sp(p, q) ⊂ GL(p + q, H) be the isometry group of the Hermitian form (·, ·)p,q .
The identifications of the previous paragraph give us embeddings

                            Sp(p, q) ⊂ U(2p, 2q) ⊂ O(4p, 4q).

In particular, the group Sp(p, q) preserves the light cone X 0 . In fact, it acts tran-
sitively on X 0 [Ja].
   We can deduce in the usual fashion an action of Sp(p, q) on functions on X 0 ,
that is,

(5.3)              (g · f )(ω) = f (g −1 ω),          g ∈ Sp(p, q), ω ∈ Hp+q .

The quaternionic scalar dilations H× also acts on X 0 , and on functions on X 0 , and
this action of H× commutes with the action of Sp(p, q), so we can use H× to define
invariant subspaces for Sp(p, q).
   Since H× is not commutative, we must consider H× -isotypic spaces instead of
looking at only eigenspaces. Specifically, write H× ≃ R× + · H1 where H1 ≃ Sp(1) ≃
SU(2) is the group of quaternions of norm 1. For each integer j ≥ 0, there is a
unique (up to equivalence) irreducible representation σj of H1 of dimension j + 1.
Realize σj on a space Yj . For a ∈ C, define a representation σja of H× on Yj by

                            σja (h) = |h|a σj (h/|h|),        h ∈ H× ,

where |h| denotes the quaternionic norm of h. The representation σj of H1 is self-
dual. Consequently, there is a nondegenerate bilinear form h·, ·ij (symmetric if j is
even, skew-symmetric if j is odd) satisfying

                  hσja (h)y, y ′ ij = hy, σja (h)y ′ ij ,    y, y ′ ∈ Yj , h ∈ H.

     Define a space Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) of smooth Yj -valued functions on X 0 by the recipe

      Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) = f ∈ C ∞ (X 0 ; Yj )  f (ωh) = σja (h)f (ω), h ∈ H× , ω ∈ X 0 .
                                                                                   	

Define also a map

                             β : Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) ⊗ Yj −→ C ∞ (X 0 )

by

                                   β(f ⊗ y)(ω) = hf (ω), yij .

  We may define actions of Sp(p, q) on Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) ⊂ C ∞ (X 0 ; Yj ) and on C ∞ (X 0 )
by means of formula (5.3). It is trivial to check that β intertwines these actions.
Furthermore, we may compute
                            β(f ⊗ y)(ωh) = hf (ωh), yij
                                               = hσja (h)f (ω), yij
(5.4)
                                               = hf (ω), σja (h)yij
                                               = β(f ⊗ σja (h)(y))(ω).

Let us denote the image of β by Sja (X 0 ). It is not difficult to check that β is a linear
isomorphism from Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) ⊗ Yj to Sja (X 0 ). Formula (5.4) therefore shows that
the joint action of Sp(p, q) × H× on Sja (X 0 ) is isomorphic to the tensor product of
the action of formula (5.3) of Sp(p, q) on Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) with the action of σja of H×
on Yj .
50                            R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


   Formula (5.4) implies that Sja (X 0 ) ⊂ S a (X 0 ). Here S a (X 0 ) is as in formula
(2.7). Standard arguments from harmonic analysis on compact groups tell us that
                                          X
                             S a (X 0 ) =    Sja (X 0 ),
                                              j≥0

the sum being in the sense of topological vector spaces. We should also note that
                                          X
                            S a+ (X 0 ) =     Sja (X 0 )
                                               j≥0
                                              j even

and
                                              X
                              S a− (X 0 ) =           Sja (X 0 ).
                                               j≥0
                                              j odd

We call Sja (X 0 ) the σja -isotypic component of C ∞ (X 0 ). We want to describe the
Sja (X 0 ) as modules for Sp(p, q). According to our construction of Sja (X 0 ), this is
essentially equivalent to describing Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) as an Sp(p, q) module.
    Our procedure for analyzing the Sp(p, q)-module structure of Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) will
follow the pattern used before in dealing with O(p, q) and U(p, q). Indeed, since
Sp(p, q) may be regarded as a subgroup of U(2p, 2q) and O(4p, 4q), much of what
we need is already done. We only give here the additional arguments that are
required. In §5.2 we analyze the K-type structure, in §5.3 we discuss composition
series and unitarity in the case p, q > 1, and in §5.4 we discuss the groups Sp(p, 1),
which are particularly interesting because of degeneracy in the K-types similar to
that already described for U(p, 1) in §4.5.
    Before beginning our detailed description of Sja (X 0 ; Yj ), we note that they can
be thought of as induced representations, as for the representations of U(p, q) and
O(p, q) previously studied. Precisely, fix a point ω0 ∈ X 0 and let Q be the stabilizer
in Sp(p, q) of ω0 . Let P be the stabilizer of the quaternionic line ω0 H through ω0 .
Define a map α̃ : P −→ H× by the formula pω0 = ωo α̃(p). The map α̃ is, in fact,
a group isomorphism α̃ : P/Q → H× . Given any representation σja of H× , the
composition σja ◦ α̃ defines a representation of P . It is straightforward to check
that the space Sja (X 0 ; Yj ) is isomorphic as an Sp(p, q) module to the representation
induced from σj−a ◦ α̃ of P .
Remark . When p = q = 1, the above representations constitute all principal series
representations, so our analysis gives a complete account of the principal series and
of the unitary dual of Sp(1, 1). Since Sp(1, 1) ≃ Spin(4, 1) is the two-fold cover of
the identity component of O(4, 1), this case reproduces the calculations of Dixmier
[Di].

5.2. K-structure of Sja (X 0 ). To investigate the structure of Sja (X 0 ) as Sp(p, q)
module, we first consider its K-structure. Here K will designate the maximal
compact subgroup Sp(p) × Sp(q) of Sp(p, q) consisting of elements of Sp(p, q) that
stabilize the decomposition Hp+q ≃ Hp ⊕ Hq . Our experience in §§2–4 suggests that
we try to extract an Sp(p) × H1 decomposition of Hm (R4p ). We start with some
notation.

   Let H(Hp ) = {f ∈ P(Hp ) | ∆f = 0}. Here ∆ is the Laplacian with respect to
the real coordinate system defined after formula (5.2). We observe that H(Hp ) is
precisely the U(2p) harmonics in P(C2p ) and is also the O(4p) harmonics in P(R4p ).
   It is well known (see [Zh]) that irreducible finite-dimensional representations of
Sp(p) can be indexed (using the highest weight) by a p-tuple of integers (ξ1 , . . . , ξp )
with ξ1 ≥ ξ2 ≥ · · · ≥ ξp ≥ 0. We shall write a representation of highest weight
                              (ξ ,ξ )
(ξ1 , ξ2 , 0, . . . , 0) as Vp 1 2 [note that the subscript indicates the group Sp(p)]. For
H1 ≃ Sp(1) ≃ SU(2), we denote by V1k , the unique irreducible representation of
SU(2) of dimension k + 1.

Proposition 5.1. We have the following decomposition for Hm (R4p ) as Sp(p) ×
H1 ≃ Sp(p) × Sp(1) module:
                               P
                               ξ1 ≥ξ2 ≥0 Vp(ξ1 ,ξ2 ) ⊗ V1ξ1 −ξ2 , p > 1,
           m   4p 
(5.5)    H (R )             ≃    ξ1 +ξ2 =m
                    Sp(p)×H1   V m ⊗ V m ,
                                           1       1                p = 1.

Hence, as Sp(p) × H1 module,
                        (P
                                                   (ξ ,ξ )
                                             Vp 1 2 ⊗ V1ξ1 −ξ2 ,                  p > 1,
(5.6)        C ∞ (S4p−1 ) ≃       Pξ1 ≥ξ2 ≥0m     m
                                   m≥0 V1 ⊗ V1 ,                                  p = 1.

Proof. See §6.3.

  Assume for the moment that p, q ≥ 2. Combining the decomposition (5.5) for p
and for q and an application of Clebsch Gordan Formula [Zh] yields

The following statement is clear from the discussion above.

Lemma 5.2. As an Sp(p) × Sp(q) × H1 module, Sja (X 0 ) decomposes into a direct
sum

                              ia,j (Vp(ξ1 ,ξ2 ) ⊗ Vq(η1 ,η2 ) ⊗ V1j ),

               Sja (X 0 ) =

where the sum is over the set described in (5.8) (see Diagram 5.10).

   For reasons that will be apparent after the description of the transition properties
of p ⊂ sp(p, q), we continue to organize K-types of Sja (X 0 ) by means of the points
(m, n) = (ξ1 + ξ2 , η1 + η2 ) in (Z+ )2 . In other words, the K-types attached to (m, n)
are those satisfying (5.8). We represent the 4-tuples (ξ1 , ξ2 , η1 , η2 ) satisfying (5.8)
as the integer points (ξ1 − ξ2 , η1 − η2 ) in an auxiliary rectangle

                      Rm,n = { (x, y) | 0 ≤ x ≤ m, 0 ≤ y ≤ n }.

These points fill a coset of (2Z)2 in a strip along the diagonal line x = y, as pictured
in Diagram 5.10. We refer to these K-types as the fiber over (m, n).

                                       η1 − η2

         Diagram 5.10. Fiber of K-types over (m, n) (if j ≡ m + 1 mod 2).

Diagram 5.10 helps us to see that the fiber over (m, n) is nonempty if and only if
                                      (i)   m+n≡j            mod 2,
(5.11)
                                  (ii)      m + n ≥ j.

Thus, when p ≥ q ≥ 2, the K-types of Sja (X 0 ) fall in the region depicted in Diagram
5.12.

  Now consider the case p > q = 1. The computation parallel to (5.7) is


                    Hm (R4p ) ⊗ Hn (R4 )

                        X
                  =                 Vp(ξ1 ,ξ2 ) ⊗ V1n
                      0≤j≤m+n




where the sum of the terms in braces is over


                       n ≥ 0,        ξ1 ≥ ξ2 ≥ 0,       ξ1 + ξ2 = m,
                          ξ1 − ξ2 + n ≥ j ≥ |(ξ1 − ξ2 ) − n|,
                              ξ1 − ξ2 + n ≡ j    mod 2.



   We again associate this set of K-types of Sja (X 0 ) to (m, n) ∈ (Z+ )2 . If we label
these K-types in the fiber over (m, n) by ξ1 − ξ2 = l, then we obtain all l such that


(5.13)                       |j − n| ≤ l ≤ min(m, j + n)


and congruent to j + n modulo 2. This is simply the set of K-types on the line
η1 − η2 = n in Diagram 5.10. So if p > q = 1, the set of points (m, n) such that the
associated fiber of K-types is nonempty can be depicted by Diagram 5.14.

the cases p ≥ q ≥ 2, leaving the interesting cases p ≥ q = 1 to §5.4. Recall the

where φ ∈ Va,j1                 ⊂ Ua,j1                  .

   So the action of sp(p, q) [⊂ u(2p, 2q) ⊂ o(4p, 4q)] on each fiber over (m, n) is
compatible with Diagram 2.19. Since each fiber has several K-types, however, in
order to have a grasp on the sp-module structure we must calculate how the sp(p, q)
action affects the various points in each fiber. This is the essence of the next lemma,
which we will prove in §6.3.

tions of the maps Tm+1,n+1   , Tm,n , we can move from any K-type in Ua,j         to any

                                           (m,n)
allows us to move from any K-type in Ua,j        to any other. Similar remarks apply

Remark . The adjoint action of K on p makes p an irreducible K-module. The K-
                                 (ξ ,ξ ,η ,η )
types that can be reached from Va,j1 2 1 2 by one application of p are isomorphic
                                      (ξ ,ξ ,η ,η )
to constituents of V ∼ = p ⊗ Va,j1 2 1 2 . Since the K-weights of p are of the form
±(ei ± fj ) (see §6.3 for notation), it is not difficult to see the K-types that are
embeddable in V ∼ are among the 16 whose highest weights are obtained by adding
one of the vectors (±1, 0, ±1, 0), (±1, 0, 0, ±1), (0, ±1, ±1, 0), or (0, ±1, 0, ±1) to
                                                       (m,n)     (m+1,n+1)
(ξ1 , ξ2 , η1 , η2 ). We will see that by moving from Ua,j   to Ua,j       by means of
                                                        (ξ ,ξ ,η ,η )
p and then back again we can move from Va,j1 2 1 2 to any of its eight nearest
neighbors, as illustrated in Diagram 5.17 (see also Diagram 5.10).

                                          Diagram 5.17

  In this diagram, the labels on the arrows indicate increments to (ξ1 , ξ2 , [0]η1 , η2 )
                                                                      −−             ++
and the arrows show which increments can be achieved by applying Tm+1,n+1         Tm,n   .
                                                                                    (ξ ,ξ2 ,η1 ,η2 )
Thus the arrow to (1, −1, 0, 0) indicates that we can move from Va,j1                                  to
 (ξ +1,ξ2 −1,η1 ,η2 )
Va,j1                 and so forth. Similar pictures apply to the other transitions. Of
course, if (ξ1 , ξ2 , η1 , η2 ) lies on the boundary of the K-type region (see Diagram
5.10), then transitions that would move it outside the region are suppressed.
   Study of Diagrams 5.10 and 5.17 will convince the reader that there are no
barriers to movement between K-types in a given fiber, as long as one can move
back and forth between the fiber and an adjacent fiber, but from the geometry of
the barriers (see Diagram 2.22) we can see that the only occasion on which one
                                                                (0,0)
cannot pass between a fiber and an adjacent one is for U0,0 —and this consists
only of the trivial K-type, so there is nothing to prove in this case. Thus by using
Lemma 5.4, we can derive the following result.

Theorem 5.5. (a) The image in any O(4p, 4q)-irreducible component of S a (X 0 )
of a given Sja (X 0 ) is an irreducible module for Sp(p, q) × H1 . In particular, if
p ≥ q > 1, then Sja (X 0 ) is reducible if and only if a ∈ Z and a ≡ j mod 2.
                          DEGENERATE PRINCIPAL SERIES                               57


   (b) Sja (X 0 ) will have Hermitian constituents if and only if a is on the unitary
axis (in which case Sja (X 0 ) will be unitary) or a is real (in which case all its
constituents will be Hermitian). A given Sp(p, q) constituent of Sja (X 0 ) is unitary
if and only if the O(4p, 4q) transitions between the nonempty fibers of the Sp(p, q)
constituent are consistent with unitarity.




Remark . As in the case of U(p, q) modules S α,β (X 0 ), one obtains an Sp(p, q)
composition series for an Sp(1) eigenspace of S a (X 0 ) by intersecting it with the
O(4p, 4q) composition series for S a (X 0 ).




Proof. Again this follows essentially from Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4. The pictures when
p ≥ q ≥ 2 will be similar to those under Case EE in §§2 and 3 (see Diagrams 3.13,
4.20, and 4.21).



5.4. The case of Sp(p, 1). The K-type regions are depicted in Diagrams 5.14 and
5.16. For p > q = 1, there is a “line” of K-types over each point in the K-type
region. We note that unlike the situation of U(p, 1), K-types along each fiber can
be moved to adjacent ones via operators in U(sp(p, 1)). The analogs of Lemmas 5.3
and 5.4 hold. We do not state them formally. The following result is easy.




Theorem 5.6. Assume p ≥ q = 1. If a 6∈ Z or a 6≡ j mod 2, then Sja (X 0 ) is
irreducible for Sp(p, 1).




   Following §4.5, we organize our description of the structure of Sp(p, 1), p > 1,
by means of a picture (see Diagram 5.18) describing the Hasse diagrams of Sja (X 0 )
in the (a, j)-plane (a ∈ R). Observe that the diagram is symmetric about the
axis a = −2p − 1, because of the duality between the modules Sj−2p−1+s (X 0 ) and
Sj−2p−1−s (X 0 ) (see Lemma 3.1).

   Again the existence of the complementary series is very interesting. Notice that
in the triangular region given by a − j ≥ −2 − 4p and a + j ≤ −2, the modules
are irreducible and unitarizable. The length of a horizontal line in this triangle
will be twice the length of the complementary series for a fixed j, that is, there
is a complementary series of length 2p − j − 1 for each j ≤ 2p − 2. The extreme
case when j = 0, that is, the spherical principal series, has complementary series
of length 2p − 1. Unlike the case for U(2p, 1) module S α,β (X 0 ), where α = β, the
complementary series does not run till a = 0. This can be explained by observing
that, for U(p, 1), the barriers A++ and A+− always intersect on the x-axis, while
for Sp(p, 1) there is a gap of length 2 between the x-intercepts of the A++ and
A+− barriers. This means that as a increases from the unitary axis it is always
the A+− barrier that first causes reducibility and prevents further unitarity, even
in the extreme case j = 0.
   Diagram 5.19 describes the situation for Sp(1, 1), with the same legends as in
Diagram 5.18. We hope it will be self-explanatory.

Remarks. We add some remarks in the case of Sp(2, 1). Our results showed that
                                               (ξ ,ξ )
the K-types of Sja (X 0 ) are of the form V2 1 2 ⊗ V1n where ξ1 , ξ2 , n satisfies (5.13)
(see Diagram 5.12). Let us instead plot the second and third coordinates, that
is, (ξ2 , n), fixing ξ1 ; this is a section of the K-type region parallel to the ξ1 axis
(see Diagram 5.20; here ξ1 (≥ j) is fixed and we also have the parity condition
ξ1 + ξ2 + n ∈ 2Z).
    The following statements are based on the second author’s thesis (see [Ta]), and
we refer our readers to that for full details. We will be somewhat sketchy. If
we consider arbitrary principal series representations of Sp(2, 1), we get highest
weights (ξ1 , ξ2 , n) that live in regions whose convex hulls are wedges in R3 . If we
take sections parallel to the ξ1 -axis, we get Diagram 5.21 (note that Diagram 5.20
is a “degenerate” case of this diagram).

   The multiplicities of K-types along the boundary of the figure is one, and the
multiplicities “grow” linearly with the distance from the boundary, attaining a con-
stant towards the ‘central’ region, much like the way the weight multiplicities of an
irreducible sl(3) representation behave in relation to its weight diagram. Further, if
we look at K-type diagrams for the quotients of the principal series representations,
we get diagrams like Diagram 5.22.

The multiplicities behave as described in the previous paragraph. Details are omit-
ted since the results arise from painstaking computations involving Blattner’s For-
mula, Branching Rules, and known composition series structure for Sp(2, 1). A
reason for the nice multiplicity result in this case may be the already apparent
linearity in the branching rules for Sp(2) × Sp(1) [a maximal compact subgroup of
Sp(2, 1)] to Sp(1) × Sp(1).

We have the commutator

                                 [∆, r2 ] = 4E + 2n

and so {∆, r2 , 4E + 2n} span a Lie algebra isomorphic to sl(2, R). If P is a homo-
geneous polynomial in P(Rn ), let deg P = E(P ) be the homogeneous degree of P .
Then

Then it is easy to see that this is an O(p, q)-invariant Hermitian pairing between
S −a+2−p−q (X 0 ) with S a (X 0 ). It gives a Hermitian inner product on S a (X 0 ) if

[Note that P ∼ can be shown to be harmonic if ∆2n P = 0 through computations

Lemma 4.1 then follows from a straightforward computation as in Lemma 2.3.
   We still need to verify that one could move freely within each fiber (see the
discussion after Diagram 4.19). Write [see (4.11)]

This is a movement in the south-westerly direction along the fiber depicted in

This projection certainly arises from the action of K on S α,β (X 0 ). Let
                              m = m1 + m2 ,             n = n1 + n2

have the mapping property as in (6.5). It suffices to show that at least one of
them has nonzero coefficients. A simple check using formulas (2.20) verifies that
all four coefficients vanish only when m = n = 0 = α = β, but when this happens,
  α,β
V(m  1 ±1,m2 ∓1,n1 ∓1,n2 ±1)
                             vanishes, that is, the fiber at (0, 0) has only one K-type.
Thus, we can always move in the south-westerly direction along the fiber. The
proof for the north-easterly movement is similar.

It is not difficult to check that {∆p , rp2 , E11 , E12 , E21 , E22 } commutes with sp(p) on

Here I2 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix. Observe that {E11 , E12 , E21 , E22 } spans the Lie
algebra gl(2) where Eij corresponds to the standard matrix unit at (i, j) in gl(2).
In particular, one sees that the Lie algebra spanned by {E11 − E22 , E12 , E21 }
corresponds to the infinitesimal action of H1 ≃ Sp(1).
   With the notation as in §5.2, we have the following result, which implies Propo-
sition 5.1 immediately.

where    V1m   ⊗   V1m   is generated by h1,m =            z1m .


Remark . If we apply the lowering operator E21 in sp(1) to the joint highest weight
vector (6.11), we find that a spanning set of Sp(p) highest weight vectors in H(Hp )
are given by
               (
                 hp,(ξ1 ,ξ2 ),j = zp+1 j hp,(ξ1 −j,ξ2 ) , j = 0, 1, ..., ξ1 − ξ2 ,

                 h1,m,j = z2 h1,m−j ,                     j = 0, 1, ..., m.

Proof. Choose the positive roots of sp(p)C to be those described by (6.8)(a) (for
1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ p) and (6.8)(b). It is easy to check that hn,(ξ1 ,ξ2 ) are sp(p)C × sp(1)C
highest weight vectors of weight (ξ1 , ξ2 , 0, 0, . . . , 0) ⊗ (ξ2 − ξ2 ). For the remaining
part of the first assertion, we refer to [Ho2].


Proof of Lemma 5.4. We proceed to compute the action of the p-part of Sp(p, q) on
Sja (X 0 ). From Lemma 6.1, the Sp(p) × Sp(q) highest weight vectors in Hm (R4p ) ⊗
Hn (R4q ) are

                   hp,(a1 ,a2 ),j hq,(b1 ,b2 ),k = zp+1 j hp,(a1 −j,a2 ) wq+1 k hq,(b1 −k,b2 ) .

   For fixed (a1 , a2 ) and (b1 , b2 ), these vectors span an sp(1) module isomorphic
to V1a1 −a2 ⊗ V1b1 −b2 . The Clebsch-Gordan formula tells us that the sp(1) highest
weight vectors in this module are the functions

                                                        z   zp+1 j
                                                                 
                          hp,(a1 −j,a2 ) hq,(b1 −j,b2 )  1        .
                                                          w1 wq+1
To adjust the homogeneity of these functions, we should multiply by an appropriate
power of rp2 . Thus we wish to study the functions

                                         z     zp+1 a2 b1 w1   wq+1 b2  z1   zq+1 c 2 d

Here aj , bj , and c are positive integers and d is a complex number. Note that our
use here of aj , bj is slightly different from that of a few lines above. A check shows
that γ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c, d) is an Sp(p) × Sp(q) highest weight vector of Sp(p) weight
(a1 + a2 + c, a2 , 0, ..., 0) and Sp(q) weight (b1 + b2 + c, b2 , 0, ..., 0). Also it is an
sp(1) highest weight vector of weight a1 + b1 .
                                                                        (ξ ,ξ )   (η ,η )
   Recall the notation in §5.3. The possible components in p⊗Vp 1 2 ⊗Vq 1 2 are
the sixteen components obtained by adding (±1, 0, ±1, 0), (±1, 0, 0, ±1), (0, ±1, ±1, 0)
and (0, ±1, 0, ±1) to (ξ1 , ξ2 , η1 , η2 ). Our intention will be to show that we can move
from the fiber over (m, n) to a neighboring fiber (m ± 1, n ± 1) and then back, and
doing this a sufficient number of times to get to any other points in the original
fiber.
   Because the moves between, say (ξ1 , ξ2 , η1 , η2 ) to (ξ1 + 1, ξ2 , η1 + 1, η2 ), and
in the reverse direction are essentially adjoint to one another (exactly so on the
unitary axis), we can do one move if and only if we can do the reverse move. Thus
it suffices to check if we can do eight of the sixteen moves.
   To show that we can do the (1,0,1,0) move, we apply Q11 [see (6.10)] to one of
our functions γ :

(6.13)           Q11 γ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c, d) = dγ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c + 1, d − 1).
To show that we can do the (1,0,0,1) move, consider

                    (A221 Q11 − (b1 + c + 1)Q12 )γ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c, d)
(6.14)
                           = −b1 dγ(a1 + 1, a2 , b1 − 1, b2 + 1, c, d − 1).

Similarly for the (0,1,1,0) move, we appeal to the formula

                    (A121 Q11 − (a1 + c + 1)Q21 )γ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c, d)
(6.15)
                           = −a1 dγ(a1 − 1, a2 + 1, b1 + 1, b2 , c, d − 1).

Finally, for the (0,1,0,1) move, we can verify that the operator

                 A121 A221 Q11 − (a1 + c + 1)A221 Q21
                        − (b1 + c + 1)A121 Q12 + (a1 + c + 1)(b1 + c + 1)Q22
applied to γ(a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c, d) yields

(6.16)          c(a1 + b1 + c + 1)dγ(a1 , a2 + 1, b1 , b2 + 1, c − 1, d − 1).

   Thus in passing from the fiber Ua,j             to the fiber Ua,j           (see §5.3, before
Lemma 5.3) by means of the action of the Qij , we can add all four of the conceivable
vectors (1, 0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1), and (0, 1, 0, 1) to a given highest weight of
  (m,n)
Ua,j . By taking adjoints, we can add the negatives of these vectors when passing
        (m+1,n+1)          (m,n)                            (m,n)       (m+1,n+1)
from Ua,j           to Ua,j        . Thus passing from Ua,j         to Ua,j          and back
                                                          (m,n)
again allows us to move from a given K-type in           Ua,j to any of its eight nearest
neighbors, as illustrated in Diagram 5.17.
   If the vanishing of either of the transition coefficients A++                 −−

1, n + 1) prevents us from moving to Ua,j                or back to Ua,j       , we can equally
                   (m,n)                (m−1,n−1)
well move from    Ua,j   down to       Ua,j  and back up to achieve the same end.
Study of the diagrams of the K-type regions (Diagrams 5.12, 5.14, 5.16) and the
positions of the barriers (Diagram 2.34) shows that the only time neither of these
strategies works is when (m, n) is on the border of the K-type region; but in this
                                                   (m,n)
case, we can see from Diagram 5.10 that the fiber Ua,j contains only one K-type,
so there is nothing to show. Although we do not need them, similar calculations may
                                    (m,n)     (m+1,n−1)
be done for the transitions from Ua,j     to Ua,j        and back. This concludes
the proof of Lemma 5.4.
Concluding remark. Although in this paper we have been exclusively concerned
with questions of infinitesimal structure, our results have some implications for
harmonic analysis on hyperbolic spaces (also describable as isotropic (reductive)
symmetric spaces [Sc]). To describe these, consider the complex projective hyper-
boloid Y = U(p, q)/(U(p − 1, q) × U(1)). Similar remarks apply to the quaternionic
hyperboloid. As noted in [Sc], the real hyperboloid
                            X1 = {w ∈ R2p+2q | (w, w)p,q = 1}
fibers over Y with fiber U(1). In fact, this is a principle U(1)-bundle. It is well
known (see the references on the first page, especially [Sc]) that all the representa-
tions occurring in the harmonic analysis of the O(2p, 2q) action on X1 are among
those considered in §§2 and 3. Our results imply that the restriction of any one of
these representations to U(p, q) decomposes discretely; more precisely, for any of
these representations of O(2p, 2q), the eigenspaces of the fiber U(1) of X1 over Y
will be irreducible modules for U(p, q). It follows that the U(p, q) harmonic analysis
of any line bundle constructed from the fibration X1 −→ Y reduces immediately
to the O(2p, 2q) harmonic analysis on X1 . In particular, harmonic analysis on Y
reduces to harmonic analysis on X1 .

                              7. Afterword of caution
   In this article we have tried to exhibit some of the elegance of representation
theory of semisimple groups. We hope some readers will be inspired to go further,
in the texts [Kn], [Wa], or the expository accounts [Ho4], [Vo4]. Here at the end,
we should warn the reader otherwise unfamiliar with representation theory that
the examples we have studied are still only a small, and in some ways misleadingly
comprehensible, sample of the full spectrum of representations of semisimple groups.
   One way to locate our representations in relation to the whole is to recall their
description as degenerate principal series [see, e.g., formulas (2.9)–(2.11)]. They are
70                            R. E. HOWE AND E. C. TAN


representations induced from certain finite-dimensional representations of the group
P1 , the stabilizer of an isotropic line. This group is a maximal parabolic subgroup,
and it is its maximality, and the corresponding smallness of the coset space G/P1 ,
that leads to the use of the adjective “ degenerate”. If one considers representations
induced from finite-dimensional irreducible representations of a minimal, rather
than maximal, parabolic subgroup, then one has the (ordinary or nondegenerate)
principal series. [For O(p, q) a general parabolic subgroup is describable as the
stabilizer of a nested sequence X1 ⊂ X2 ⊂ X3 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xk of isotropic subspaces. If
the sequence contains a subspace of every dimension from one to min(p,q), then the
parabolic stabilizing it is minimal. Similar remarks apply to U(p, q) and Sp(p, q).]
Principal series have the following properties:

     (1) They come in continuous families, parametrized by several (in place of the
         single parameter of our examples) complex variables.
     (2) For generic values of the parameters, they are irreducible.
     (3) In general, they have finite composition series.
     (4) Any (reasonable) irreducible representation is equivalent (via an appropri-
         ate notion of equivalence) to a constituent of some principal series.

Properties (1)–(3) are qualitatively similar to what we saw in this paper, and prop-
erty (4) tells us that if we understand the principal series, then we understand
an essential part, in particular the building blocks, of semisimple representation
theory.
   It might seem that properties (1)–(4) virtually finish the subject, but no one
has so far managed to achieve control of general principal series comparable to the
picture given for the examples in this paper. The point is that the combinatorial
structure of the composition series of a general principal series, and of its con-
stituents, is rather spectacularly more complex than what we encountered in our
examples. (See [CC] for a recent discussion.) Some of the most important advances
in the subject (Langlands classification [Kn, Wa, Vo2]; Kazhdan-Lusztig conjec-
tures [BB, BK, KL, Vo3]) have involved obtaining significant information about
the composition series of principal series.
   Let us remark that when q = 1, our maximal parabolic is the minimal and
only proper parabolic subgroup, and in this case our representations are ordinary,
not degenerate, principal series. When p is also small, our representations in fact
include all, or essentially all, principal series, so that we find all the irreducible
representations, and since we know which are unitary, we classify the unitary dual.
Specifically we obtain all principal series for U(1, 1) and for Sp(1, 1) (≃ Spin(4, 1)),
and we obtain all principal series up to twisting by a quasi-character of the whole
group for O(2, 1) and U(2, 1).
   Since, at least when p and q are greater than one, the representations we have
considered are quite special, one may ask if any interest attaches to them, aside from
the inherent attractiveness of the picture we have tried to present. In fact, these
representations arise in studying harmonic analysis on hyperboloids. The full im-
port of the term “harmonic analysis” has never been completely decided, but many
would agree that it certainly includes the decomposition of L2 -spaces of homoge-
neous spaces. Among the homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups, the class
of “semisimple symmetric spaces” or “affine symmetric spaces” [F-J] recommends
                             DEGENERATE PRINCIPAL SERIES                                     71


itself as particularly interesting. The hyperboloids
                             Xt = {w ∈ Rp+q | (w, w)p,q = t}
are very closely related to (precisely, are principal fibre bundles with compact fibre
over) some of the simplest examples of semisimple symmetric spaces [Sc], and the
representations we have studied enable one to decompose the L2 -spaces of hyper-
boloids. The connection with harmonic analysis on semisimple symmetric spaces
was the motivation for many of the papers cited in the introduction.
