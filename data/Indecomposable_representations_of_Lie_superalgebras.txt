                                                    Abstract. In 1960’s I. Gelfand posed a problem: describe indecomposable representations
                                                    of any simple infinite dimensional Lie algebra g of polynomial vector fields. Here by applying
                                                    the elementary technique of Gelfand and Ponomarev a toy model of the problem is solved:

                                                    finite dimensional indecomposable representations of vect(0|2), the Lie superalgebra of vector
                                                    fields on the (0|2)-dimensional superspace, are described.
                                                        Since vect(0|2) is isomorphic to sl(1|2) and osp(2|2), their representations are also are de-
                                                    scribed. The result is generalized in two directions: for sl(1|n) and osp(2|2n). Independently
                                                    and differently J. Germoni described indecomposable representation of the series sl(1|n) and
                                                    several individual Lie superalgebras.
                                                        Partial results for other simple Lie superalgebras without Cartan matrix are reviewed.
                                                    In particular, it is only for vect(0|2) ≃ sl(1|n) and sh(0|4) ≃ psl(2|2) that the typical
                                                    irreducible representations can not participate in indecomposable modules; for other simple
                                                    Lie superalgebras without Cartan matrix (of series vect(0|n), svect(0|n), s]   vect(0|n), spe(n)
                                                    for n ≥ 3 and sh(0|m) for m ≥ 5) one can construct indecomposable representations with
                                                    arbitrary composition factors.
                                                        Several tame open problems are listed, among them a description of odd parameters,
                                                    previously ignored.


                                                To the memory of Misha Saveliev together with whom we began to apply the description
                                             of representations of osp(N|2) to the solution of N-extended Leznov-Saveliev equations, cf.
                                             [LSS].

                                                                                          Introduction
                                                This is a version of the paper published in: In: Sissakian A. N. (ed.), Memorial volume
                                             dedicated to Misha Saveliev and Igor Luzenko, JINR, Dubna, 2000, 126–131.
                                                Meanwhile Noam Shomron [Sh] rediscovered an unpublished A. Shapovalov’s results on
                                             modules over vect(0|m), svect(0|m), pe(m), spe(m) and h(0|m), sh(0|m). Shomron formu-
                                             lated it only for vect(0|m) but went further in formulation and his proof is impressive.
                                                In what follows the ground field is C. This paper is an attempt to review the subject, in
                                             particular, formulate tame open problems.
                                             0.0. Prehistory. The study of irreducible finite dimensional representations of simple finite
                                             dimensional Lie algebras over C is a natural problem. It turns out that such representations
                                             are completely reducible and, therefore, it suffices to study irreducible modules. Situation
                                             changes when we consider infinite dimensional modules, even if the module is “semi-infinite”
                                             in a sence, e.g., possesses a highest or lowest weight vector. Among such representation and
                                             their “infinite in both ways” generalizations, Harish-Chandra modules, there is no complete
                                             reducibility but the problem of description of all indecomposable modules in these categories
                                             seem to be wild. (So we can describe either finite dimensional (hence, irreducible), or infinite
                                             dimensional and irreducible, or nothing.)

   The study of invariant differential operators on manifolds is closely related with continuous
in a natural topology infinite dimensional representations of simple infinite dimensional Lie
algebras of vector fields L. Though the representations themselves are no longer completely
reducible, the description of irreducible ones reduces, to an extent, to finite dimensional
representations of simple finite dimensional Lie algebras L0 , the linear parts of L (see [R]
and an elucidation [BL]). This reduction to finite dimensional representation of simple Lie
algebras was, perhaps, a motivation for I. Gelfand to consider the classification problem of
indecomposable representations (say, in the class of modules with highest or lowest weight
vectors) of such Lie algebras not hopeless (at least, in the particular and exceptional case of
vect(1) = der C[x]). Observe that this problem is still open.
   Passing to Lie superalgebras, we are forced to consider their indecomposable representa-
tions even in the above problems for several reasons:
   (1) even finite dimensional representations of simple Lie superalgebras are never completely
reducible (with the only exception of osp(1|2n); the proof of this fact is similar to that for
Lie algebras, cf. [B]);
   (2) the description of irreducible and continuous in a natural topology infinite dimen-
sional representations of simple infinite dimensional Lie superalgebras of vector fields L does
not reduce to finite dimensional representations of the corresponding finite dimensional Lie
superalgebras L0 but even if we confine ourselves to such representations we have to face
problem (1). (This was the reason problem (1) was first tackled; G. Shmelev [Sh1], [Sh2]
considered problem (1) only in conneciton with problem (2) in a particular case of the latter:
for L0 = osp(m|2n).)
   One more reason is provided by the necessity to classify embeddings of osp(N|2) into the
simple Lie superalgebras; this classification is a part of the explicit solution of vector-valued
generalizations of N-extended Leznov-Saveliev equations considered, so far, for N = 1 only,
see [LSS].


0.1. History. Main result. Unless otherwise stated, in what follows g is either sl(1|n) or
osp(2|2n). For g, the description of irreducible finite dimensional representations is complete,
cf. [BL], [L1]. The next step — a description of indecomposable modules — was performed
under the assumption of h-diagonalizability in [Sh1], [Sh2], [L2] who used a key observation
A. A. Kirillov made: he related the problem with a result of [ZN].
   A draft of this paper was written in 1989; I delayed the publication because I wanted
to compute the odd parameters. Regrettably, it is still an open problem. Meanwhile the
problem considered in this paper was solved for sl(1|2) by Su Yucai [S2] (with minor omis-
sions). He also classifieded indecomposable infinite dimensional (Harish-Chandra) modules
over osp(1|2), see [S1].
   Here we complete the description of indecomposable finite dimensional representations of
g in full generality. Our results are based on the deep results of I. Gelfand and Ponomarev
[GP]. Not only are they deep, they are obtained by elementary methods and I consider this
as an advantage.
   Meanwhile J. Germoni independently considered the case sl(1|n) by much more sophis-
ticated methods (which enabled him to relate the result with quivers, etc.), cf. [G1], and
completely classified indecomposable representation. However, [G1] and its continuation
[G2] do not mention either osp(2|2n) considered in [L2] or odd parameters discussed here.
   Observe that the description of indecomposable representations for sl(1|n) and osp(2|2n)
are obtained by practically identical means, be they either elementary (as here) or more
involved (as in [G1]).

0.2. A related problem. For gl(m|n) or sl(m|n), Sergeev proved [Se] that any finite
dimensional representation realizable in the space of tensors T (V ⊕ Π(V )) is completely
reducible. There is no complete reducibility for representations realizable in the general
tensor algebra T (V ⊕ Π(V )) ⊕ V ∗ ⊕ Π(V ∗ )). To distinguish a subalgebra of the tensor
algebra inside of which the complete reducibility takes place for g 6= gl is an interesting open
problem for various representations V , the identity representation of the matrix algebra, the
representations of minimal dimention and the adjoint representation are most interesting to
consider.
0.3. On tame and wild representations. The problem of description of indecomposable
representations of Λ(n) for n > 2 is a wild one (this inference from [GP] is made in [ZN]).
Similarly, one deduces that to describe indecomposable representations of the direct sum of
several copies of Λ(2) is a wild problem.
   Germoni proved that the description of indecomposable representations of g = sl(p|q),
where 1 < p ≤ q, is a wild problem [G1] by cohomology arguments. Roughly speaking, it
seem to be related with the possibility to embed the direct sum of two copies of sl(1|1) into
g since this reduces to description of indecomposable representations of the direct sum of
several copies of Λ(2). The arguments are, however, subtler, and it is an open problem to
consider the indecomposable representations of simple (and close to them) Lie superalgebras
of other types.
   For certain particular representation of any superalgebra one can always obtain the final
result. For example, P. Grozman recently computed with the help of his package SuperLie,
see [GL], the decomposition of g ⊗ g for certain particular Lie superalgebras g. In [G2] Ger-
moni considered indecomposable representations of two of the exceptional Lie superalgebras.
0.4. Miscellanea. Several such partial results obtained with P. Grozman constitute explicit
decomposition of g ⊗ g for g = sl(1|1), sl(1|2), psl(2|2) and some other algebras. They are
prompted by A. Vaintrob who hopes to relate them with the description of invariants of links
and tangles à la [BS] and are presented elsewhere.
                             §1. Representations of sl(1|1)
   Thanks to the super analog of I. Schur lemma, to consider the irreducible representations
of sl(1|1) is the same as to consider same of the (associative) Clifford superalgebra Cl~(2) =
U(sl(1|1))/(E − ~) for ~ ∈ C, where E is the central element of sl(1|1). General Algebra
and Linear Algebra in Superspaces yield the following statement:
1.1. Proposition . The irreducible representations of Cl~(2) are:
  1) for ~ 6= 0: the 1|1-dimensional modules V ~ with even highest vector on which E acts
as the operator of multiplication by the scalar ~ and Π(V ~);
  2) for ~ = 0: the 1|0-dimensional trivial module 1 and Π(1).
  Problem Describe representations of U (sl(1|1))/(E n − ~).
  Observe that for ~ = 0 the superalgebra Cl~(2) turns into the Grassmann superalgebra
Λ(2) with two generators. In order to study indecomposable representations of Λ(n), recall
some general results on Λ(n)-modules.
  Modules over Grassmann superalgebras are described in [BG]. Let Λ(n) be Grassmann
superalgebra with n indeterminates, i.e., the free supercommutative superalgebra with n
odd indeterminates θ1 , . . . , θn . Setting deg θi = 1 we define a Z-gradation on Λ(n). In this
section we only consider left unitary Z-graded modules with a compatible Z/2-grading, i.e.,
the parity of the elements is their degree modulo 2 and Λ(n)i ⊗ Vj ⊂ Vi+j for i, j ∈ Z. Given
a Λ(n)-module V = ⊕Vi and r ∈ Z, define V [r] by setting V [r]i = Vr−i .

  A Λ(n)-module V is called reduced if ΘV = 0 for Θ = θ1 · · · · · θn (the highest term in
Λ(n)).
Lemma . ([BG]) i) Any free Λ(n)-module V is of the form F = ⊕r Λ(n)[r].
   ii) Any Λ(n)-module V can be represented in the form F ⊕ V rd , where F is free and V rd
is reduced.
   iii) Any indecomposable Λ(n)-module is either isomorphic to Λ(n)[r] for some r or is
reduced.
  Since we are only interested in compatibility of the action with parity, it suffices to consider
shifts of grading modulo 2 in which case they coinside with the change of parity functor Π.
1.3. Reduced modules over Λ(2). Let a and b be generators of Λ(2). On a reduced
Λ(2)-module V the operators a and b satisfy
                                     a2 = b2 = ab = ba = 0
and, therefore, results from [GP] are applicable. Let us recall these results (and adjust
them to supercase). We will depict Λ(2)-modules by directed graphs whose nodes stand for
subsuperspaces of V ; the action of a is depicted by a horisontal arrow, that of b by a vertical
one; up to changes of parity both actions are isomorphisms representable in a basis by the
identity matrix. The curvy arrow may stand for either a or b and corresponds to the Jordan
cell with eigenvalue µ ∈ C.
   Type I modules V (p + qε; dir): are determined by their dimension p + qε, where q = p or
q = p ± 1, and the direction (dir = in or dir = out) indicating the submodule (each node is
1-dimensional). Here is the diagram representing V (p + qε; dir) for (p, q) = (3, 2) and (2, 3),
respectively:
                     ◦ −→ ◦                           ◦

   Type II modules V (p; m + nε; dir; µ) are generalizations of Type I modules by means of
the operator depicted by a curvy arrow (here depicted by the composition of arrows of two
solid lines) from the space represented by the most left and upper node to the most right
and low one or the other way round.

Modules V (p; m + nε; dir; µ) are determined by three nonnegative integers: the superdi-
mension m + nε of the subsuperspace corresponding to each node and the total number of
nodes, p; in either of the two slanted lines the graph “lies” on and the directions dir of the
first arrow (since we only consider graded modules, the odd operators a and b must change
parity; hence, the direction of the last noncurvy arrow must coincide with that of the first
one), and the parameter µ corresponds to the eigenvalue of the Jordan cell represented by
the curvy arrow (not depicted).
   The following result is an easy corollary of [GP], pp. 59–60 (compare with [ZN], where
the description of type II modules contains an omission).

Lemma . Let V be a reduced indecomposable Λ(2)-module. Up to the change of parity, V
is one of the above modules V (p + qε; dir) of type I or modules V (p; m + nε; dir; µ) of type
II.
1.4. Indecomposable representations of Cl~(2) for ~ 6= 0. Let X± be the generators
of sl(1|1). Denote by V ~(n) for n > 0 the sl(1|1)-module induced from the n-dimensional
representation ρ~ of the uppertriangular subalgebra b = Span(E, X+ ):
                   ρ~(E) = Jn (~) for the Jordan cell Jn (~),      ρ~(X+ ) = 0.
Clearly, V ~(1) = V ~ and on V ~(n) we have:
                                                                                 

         ρ~(X− ) =          , ρ~(E) =                     ,       ρ~(X+ ) =             .
                     1n 0                    0   Jn (~)                      0   0

Lemma . Up to the change of parity, all the indecomposable representations of Cl~(2) for
~ 6= 0 are realized in the modules V ~(n).
Proof. A representation from Lemma is, clearly, indecomposable. Such representatins re-
alize the only way to glue two copies of V ~: indeed, dim H 1 (sl(1|1); End(V ~)) = 1. Since
                          ˜               ˜ it is impossible to glue modules V ~ for different ~’s.
dim H 1 (sl(1|1); V ~ ⊗ V ~) = 0 for ~ 6= ~,
Similar argument applies to V ~(n).
  Now, let us collect our results.
1.5.   Theorem . Indecomposable finite dimensional representations of sl(1|1) are realized,
up o   the change of parity, in the modules
  1)   V ~(n) of dimension n + nε;
  2)   V (p + qε; dir) of type I; its dimension is equal to p + qε with q = p or p ± 1;
  3)   V (p; m + nε; dir; µ) of type II; its dimension is equal to p(m + n)(1 + ε);
  4)   gl(1|1); this is a free Λ(2)-module.
                      §2. Irreducible representations of g 6≃ sl(1|1)
   The Lie superalgebras g of series sl and osp(2|2n) have a Z-grading of the form g =
g−1 ⊕ g0 ⊕ g1 . Hence, ([BL]), any irreducible g-module Lh with highest weight h and even
highest vector is the quotient of the induced module I(V h ) = U(g) ⊗U (g0 ⊕g1 ) V h for an
irreducible g0 -module V h with highest weight h.
   V. Kac gave a description [K] of conditions under which the module I(V h ) is irreducible,
if dim V h < ∞. A weight h is typical if (h + ρ, ϕi ) 6= 0 for the Killing form (·, ·) on g and
every root ϕi of the odd space g−1 . (Here ρ is a half sum of positive even roots and negative
odd ones.)
   For atypical weights the modules I(h) constitute infinite in both directions acyclic com-
plexes, first described in[BL] and [L1]. Recall this result.

        = osp(2|2) ∼
                   = vect(0|2) the interpretation of the modules in the realization by vector
fields is the most graphic one. Every irreducible finite dimensional vect(0|2)-module is of
the following form (up to Π). Let (a, b) be the weights with respect to ξ1 ∂1 and ξ2 ∂2 ,
respectively. Then I(V (a,b) ) is irreducible if (a, b) 6= (0, −n) or (n + 1, 1). In the latter
case, set Σ−n = I(V (0,−n) ) and Ωn = I(V (n+1,1) ). These spaces are called the superspaces
of integral (−n)-forms and differential n-forms, respectively. They constitute an acyclic
complex

Denote by i(k) the kernel of the outgoing arrow at the k-th place of the above complex.
This is an irreducible module and two modules with neighboring numbers are glued in one
indecomposable one, more exactly,
           Σ−n ≃ i(−n + 1) −→ Π(i(−n)) and Ωn ≃ Σ∗−n ≃ i(n) −→ Π(i(n + 1)).
These arrows can be organized in graphs similar to the cases g = sl(1|1). Let us number the
nodes in graphs corresponding to modules of type I downwards, starting with an integer k.
Let the n-th node denote the module i(n) or Π(i(n)), and denote the corresponding module
by V (p + qε, dir; k). The dimension of the module obtained is equal to 2p(k + p − 1)(1 + ε)
if p = q and to N + (N − 1)ε, where N = k(2p + 1) + 2p2 , for p = q − 1, to N + (N + 1)ε,
where N = k(2p + 1) + 2(p2 − p + 1), for p = q + 1 The following module Sq(k) of dimension
(4k−2)(1+ε) is an analog of the representation of sl(1|1) in gl(1|1), i.e., the free Λ(2)-module
of rank 1:
                                   i(k)     −→ Π(i(k + 1))
                                     ↓                  ↓
                               Π(i(k − 1)) −→         i(k)

Lemma . ([Sh1]) For g 6≃ sl(1|1) we have Ext1 (I(ϕ), I(χ)) = 0;
                               (
                                 C if, up to Π, (i(ϕ), i(χ)) = (I(ϕ), I(χ))
           Ext1 (i(ϕ), i(χ)) =
                                 0 otherwise.
  This lemma shows that indecomposable modules over g 6≃ sl(1|1) are simpler than those
over sl(1|1).
                         §3. Supervarieties of representations
   So far we have described points of the variety that parametrizes g-modules.
   To consider the supervariety is not difficult: its points are the same as those of the under-
lying variety. The tangent space to the supervariety of parameters at its point corresponding
to an indecomposiable module V is, as follows from the cohomology theory (cf., e.g., [F]),
isomorphic to H 1 (g; End(V )).
Theorem . ([Sh1]) H 1 (g; End(V ))1̄ = 0 for g 6∼ = sl(1|1) and any indecomposiable module V
        ∼               ∼
or if g = sl(1|1) and V = V~(n).
  Proof is straightforward, with the help of the Cazimir element.
  For V ∼6= V~(n) there are odd parameters. Indeed, consider the simplest cases: V ∼     = 1 or
Π(1). In either case, End(V ) ∼= 1 and, since H 1 (sl(1|1)) ∼= C[ξ, η]/(ξη), where ξ and η are
odd 1-cocycles, see [FL], dim H 1 (sl(1|1))1̄ = 2. There are no obstructions to globalization of
these deformations.
  Computation of H 1 (g; End(V )) for modules more complicated than the trivial one seems
at the moment to be too difficult to handle by bare hands or even bare computers.
    §4. On indecomposable representations of vectorial Lie superalgebras
                                                                                       ]
    Consider any of the simple finite dimensional vectorial Lie superalgebras L except svect(0|n)
                                                k
or spe(n) in their standard Z-grading: L = ⊕ Li . Set
                                                −1

                      L≥ = ⊕ Li ; L> = ⊕ Li ; L− = ⊕ Li ; L≤ = ⊕ Li .

Let V be an irreducible L0 -module. We will consider two types of L-modules:
  1) let L> V = 0 and set I(V ) = U(L) ⊗U (L≥ V .
                 INDECOMPOSABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF LIE SUPERALGEBRAS                               7

   2) let L< V = 0 and set I(V ) = U(L) ⊗U (L≤ V .
   The Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix and with a compatible grading are of the form
L = L−1 ⊕ L0 ⊕ L1 , where L1 ≃ L∗−1 . Therefore, for them I(V ) ≃ I(V ∗ ).
   Contrarywise for the vectorial Lie superalgebras the diference between modules I(V ) and
I(V ) is crucial. As is easy to see with the help of the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem,
I(V ) ≃ Λ(L− ) ⊗ V , as spaces. For vectorial Lie superalgebras distinct from svect(0|2),
svect(0|3) ≃ spe(3) and sh(0|4) the space I(V ) is of infinite dimension.
   For svect(0|3) and spe(n), though I(V ) is of finite dimension, still I(V ) 6≃ I(V ∗ ). However,
thanks to the existence of complete description of typical spe(n)-modules, see [L3] one may
hope for a complete description of indecomposable spe(n)-modules, at least, for n = 3. The
limitations for this hope are set by Theorem 4.2.
4.1. Theorem . (Shapovalov, 1985) Typical irreducible representaitons of vect(0|2) and
sh(0|4) are direct summands.

4.2. Theorem . (Shapovalov, 1985) Indecomposable representaitons of vect(0|n) for n > 2,
spe(n), svect(0|n), s]
                     vect(0|n) for n > 3 and sh(0|n) for n > 4 may include any irreducible
module as the composition factor.
  No proof of these theorems was ever published. Recent result of Shomron (given with
proof) [Sh] covers the vect(0|n) case and indicates how to tackle the other cases.

                                            Appendix
A.1. Linear algebra in superspaces. Generalities. A superspace is a Z/2-graded space;
for a superspace V = V0̄ ⊕ V1̄ denote by Π(V ) another copy of the same superspace: with
the shifted parity, i.e., (Π(V ))ī = Vī+1̄ . The superdimension of V is dim V = p + qε, where
ε2 = 1 and p = dim V0̄ , q = dim V1̄ . (Usually dim V is expressed as a pair (p, q) or p|q; this
obscures the fact that dim V ⊗ W = dim V · dim W which becomes manifest with the use of
ε.)
   A superspace structure in V induces the superspace structure in the space End(V ). A basis
of a superspace is always a basis consisting of homogeneous vectors; let Par = (p1 , . . . , pdim V )
be an ordered collection of their parities. We call Par the format of the basis of V . A square
supermatrix of format (size) Par is a dim V × dim V matrix whose ith row and ith column
are of the same parity pi . The matrix unit Eij is supposed to be of parity pi + pj and the
bracket of supermatrices (of the same format) is defined via Sign Rule:
   if something of parity p moves past something of parity q the sign (−1)pq accrues; the
formulas defined on homogeneous elements are extended to arbitrary ones via linearity.
   Examples of application of Sign Rule: setting [X, Y ] = XY − (−1)p(X)p(Y ) Y X we get the
notion of the supercommutator and the ensuing notions of the supercommutative superal-
gebra and the Lie superalgebra (that in addition to superskew-commutativity satisfies the
super Jacobi identity, i.e., the Jacobi identity amended with the Sign Rule). The derivation
of a superalgebra A is a linear map D : A −→ A such that satisfies the Leibniz rule (and
Sign rule)
                              D(ab) = D(a)b + (−1)p(D)p(a) aD(b).
In particular, let A = K[x] be the free supercommutative polynomial superalgebra in x =
(x1 , . . . , xn ), where the superstructure is determined by the parities of the indeterminates:
p(xi ) = pi . Partial derivatives are defined (with the help of Leibniz and Sign Rules) by the
               ∂xi
formulas ∂x       j
                    = δi,j .

  Clearly, the collection derA of all superdifferentiations of A is a Lie superalgebra vect(m|n)
on m even and n odd indeterminates whose elements are of the form

   Define the superalgebra of differential forms as the supercommutative superalgebra of

   The general linear Lie superalgebra of all supermatrices of size Par is denoted by gl(Par);
usually, gl(0̄, . . . , 0̄, 1̄, . . . , 1̄) is abbreviated to gl(dim V0̄ | dim V1̄ ). Usually, Par is of the form
(0̄, . . . , 0̄, 1̄, . . . , 1̄). Such a format is called standard. In this paper we can do without
nonstandard formats but they are vital in the study of systems of simple roots that the
reader might be interested in. Any matrix from gl(Par) can be expressed as the sum of its
even and odd parts; in the standard format this is the block expression:

   The supertrace is the map gl(Par) −→ C, (Aij ) 7→ (−1)pi Aii . Since str[x, y] = 0, the
                                                                             P
space of supertraceless matrices constitutes the special linear Lie subsuperalgebra sl(Par).
   Lie superalgebras that preserve bilinear forms: two types. To the linear map F
of superspaces there corresponds the dual map F ∗ between the dual superspaces; if A is the
supermatrix corresponding to F in a basis of the format Par, then to F ∗ the supertransposed
matrix Ast corresponds:
                                              (Ast )ij = (−1)(pi +pj )(pi +p(A)) Aji .
    The supermatrices X ∈ gl(Par) such that
            X st B + (−1)p(X)p(B) BX = 0 for an homogeneous matrix B ∈ gl(Par)
constitute the Lie superalgebra aut(B) that preserves the bilinear form on V with matrix B.
   Recall that the supersymmetry of the
                                       homogeneous   form ω means
                                                                      that its matrix B
                                                                                        satisfies
                                                                                                
                                             t           p(B) t
                 u               u        R         (−1)     T                           R S
the condition B = B, where B =                                    for the matrix B =              .
                                       (−1)p(B) S t   −U t                               T U
Similarly, skew-supersymmetry of B means that B u = −B. Thus, we see that the upsetting
of bilinear forms u : Bil(V, W ) −→ Bil(W, V ), which for the spaces V = W is expressed on
matrices in terms of the transposition, is a new operation.
   Most popular canonical forms of the nondegenerate supersymmetric form are the ones

The usual notation for aut(Bev (m|2n)) is osp(m|2n) or ospsy (m|2n). (Observe that the
passage from V to Π(V ) sends the supersymmetric forms to superskew-symmetric ones,
preserved by the “symplectico-orthogonal” Lie superalgebra sp′ o(2n|m) or ospsk (m|2n) which
is isomorphic to ospsy (m|2n) but has a different matrix realization. We never use notation
sp′ o(2n|m) in order not to confuse with the special Poisson superalgebra.)

   The special periplectic superalgebra is spe(n) = {X ∈ pe(n) : strX = 0}.
   Observe that though the Lie superalgebras ospsy (m|2n) and pesk (2n|m), as well as pesy (n)
and pesk (n), are isomorphic, the difference between them is sometimes crucial.
