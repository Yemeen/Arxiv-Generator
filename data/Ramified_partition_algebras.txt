                                             1         Introduction
                                             For k a ring and Q ∈ k the partition algebras Pn (Q) (n = 1, 2, ..) are a tower of finite
                                             dimensional unital k-algebras. These algebras first arose in the context of transfer
                                             matrix algebras in Statistical Mechanics [24, 25], but are also known to play roles
                                             in invariant theory [21, 28] analogous to that of the Brauer algebra [4, 35, 19], and
                                             in the study of Schur algebras (see [20, 30] and cf. [11, §4]). They have a rich
                                             and (for k = C) tractable representation theory [26, 36]. The ramified partition
                                                         (T )     (T )
                                             algebras Pn = Pn (Q) are a generalisation depending on a poset T , which is
                                             again physically motivated (see below), but also natural as an abstract extension,
                                             as we shall see. In this paper we construct these new algebras (in §2), and describe
                                             the representation theory of the simplest non–trivial cases (§3).
                                                 An important tool in our approach is quasi–heredity [8, 9, 10]. When applicable
                                             this provides a crucial organizational scheme for an algebra, via constructions for a
                                             set of standard modules (the set of heads of these modules constituting a complete
                                             set of simple modules [10, §A1]). When, as here, quasi–heredity ‘commutes’ with a

globalisation functor [16, §6.2] [5] on a tower of algebras we have a singularly powerful
representation theoretic tool, even when the algebras are semisimple (indeed in
semisimple cases it typically reduces to a glorified Jones basic construction [15, 18]).
       (T )                                      (T )
Let Pn −mod denote the category of left Pn –modules. We may suppose without
loss of generality, as we shall see, that the underlying    set of the poset T is {1, 2, .., d}.
Write Q = (Q1 , Q2 , ..) ∈ k d and set Qπ = t∈T Qt ∈ k. We shall show that for Qπ
                                               Q

invertible in k there exists an idempotent eT ∈ Pn such that eT Pn eT ∼
                                                       (T )                 (T )       (T )
                                                                                    = Pn−1 . It
                                         (T )            (T )                    (T )
follows that there are functors F : Pn −mod → Pn−1 −mod and G : Pn−1 −mod →
  (T )
Pn −mod, called localisation and globalisation respectively, which port information
between layers in the tower. Taken in conjunction with quasi–heredity this provides
the framework for an iterative mechanism of analysis (with the base case n = 1
being amenable to brute force).1
    This paper is concerned with the representation theory of the ramified partition
algebras. This requires no reference to, nor interest in, the physical applications,
but a remark on the authors’ guiding motivation in constructing and studying these
algebras is in order (see §4.1 for a more detailed exposition). The guiding motivation
for this work is the study of Statistical Mechanical lattice models [2, 32] of three
dimensional physical systems by exact computation [3, 33]. There has been some
progress in this study using the ordinary partition algebra Pn = Pn (Q) [29], which
underlies the transfer matrix algebra formalism (see §4.1) for Potts models in high
dimensions [24, 2]. However, as may be observed from [25, 7] and references therein,
there is a problem with the ordinary partition algebra approach in descending in
dimension to a physical lattice capturing 3d (or indeed any finite d > 2) spatial
geometry. We suggest that a better foundation would be provided by a more general
algebra of clock models [13, 12] or similar models [1, 14]. That is, one in which the set
of spin configurations is equipped, though the form of the interaction Hamiltonian
(see §4.1), with a richer structure than the discrete topology (which is the structure
effectively provided by the Potts Hamiltonian). Our reasoning is as follows. The
defining basis of the partition algebra is built from the set N of spatial lattice sites
(with |N| = n) by forming the set of partitions of N. A partition forms a base for
a rather crude topology on N (a partition topology). In the partition algebra this
constrains the spatial geometry and the spin interactions to be very crude — and in
this sense the two limitations are linked. Accordingly we look here at a generalization
of the partition algebra suitable for the interactions in clock models. The idea is
that the set partitions of Pn (Q) should be glorified with a structure interpolating
between the discrete topology and the metric topology of 3d Euclidean space. The
challenge is that this structure not destroy the property of associative algebra.
    The ordinary partition algebra is the case T = {1}, however the representation
             (T )
theory of Pn is vastly richer than that of Pn in general, as we will show. The
simplest interesting new case is T = 2 := ({1, 2}, 1 ≤ 2). In this paper we concen-
trate mainly on this case. We determine conditions for it to be quasi–hereditary,
                                                              (2)
and construct its standard modules. We show that Pn (Q) is generically semisim-
ple, but (in §4) we also exhibit, for certain values of Q, special representations R
which may be used to show non–semisimplicity at these values of Q. It is also these
   1
     Both globalisation and quasi–heredity apply to the ordinary partition algebra, and are key
tools in its analysis [26]. The utility of globalisation is a natural consequence of the physical
context of these algebras (cf. [27]), but it is intriguing to see how often quasi–heredity also occurs
in this setting [6, 26, 36] (in as much as a physical interpretation is so far lacking).


                                                  2
representations which may be used in clock model transfer matrix computations (cf.
[24]). Results of these computations for clock models will be presented in a separate
paper, but to underline the motivation we include a small sample of such results
here — zeros of the partition function for ZQ –symmetric models (recall that zeros
converge on the real axis at a phase transition point [24, 31]).
    The representation R is also the obvious generalization of the ‘Potts’ represen-
tation of Pn which arises in invariant theory [24, 21, 30]. An analysis of this, and of
                                        (T )                                 (T )
the generic representation theory of Pn , is the first step in seeking for Pn a role
in invariant theory analogous to that of Pn .


2     Preliminaries
Let (T, ≤) be a poset of degree d, k a field, Qt ∈ k for each t ∈ T , and k–algebra
Pn (Qt ) the ordinary partition algebra. The T –ramifiedNpartition algebra will be
defined to be a certain subalgebra of the tensor product t∈T Pn (Qt ), depending on
≤.

                                  (T )
2.1    Construction of Pn
First we recall the definition of Pn (Q) [26, §1]. Given a set U we write EU for the set
of partitions of U (we identify this with the set of equivalence relations on U, writing
∼a for the relation corresponding to a ∈ EU ). Note that any bijection f : U → V
naturally underlies a corresponding bijection Ef : EU → EV .
     For a ∈ EU we write q ∈ a for q ⊆ U a part of a as a partition. For S ⊂ U
write a|S for the restriction of a to S. Given n ∈ N we write n = {1, 2, . . . , n},
n′ = {1′ , 2′ , . . . , n′ }, and so on. We set pn = En∪n′ , and kpn the k–space with basis
pn .
     Let f : n ∪ n′ → n′ ∪ n′′ be the map i 7→ i′ . Then given a, b ∈ pn we define
du (ab) ∈ En∪n′ ∪n′′ by identifying with the equivalence relation generated by a and
Ef (b). Let g : n ∪ n′′ → n ∪ n′ be the map i 7→ i for i ∈ n and i′′ 7→ i′ for i′′ ∈ n′′ .
Then define d(ab) = Eg (du (ab)|n∪n′′ ) ∈ pn . Fixing Q ∈ k we now define the product
ab ∈ kpn by
                                          ab = Qc(a,b) d(ab)                            (1)
where c(a, b) = #{q ⊆ n′ : q ∈ du (ab)}. In [26, §1] it is shown that this product (k–
linearly extended) endows kpn with the structure of a unital associative k–algebra,
which we call the partition algebra, and denote by Pn (Q).
    Now fix a poset (T, ≤) with T = {1, 2, .., d} but ≤ arbitrary, and an element
Q = (Q1 , Q2 , .., Qd ) ∈ k d . Our aim is to define the T –ramified partition algebra as
                     (d)     N
a subalgebra of Pn =            t∈T Pn (Qt ), depending on the partial order ≤. We will
often concentrate on the special case T = {1, 2} with 1 ≤ 2 (and where a poset is
intended, 2 will denote this one, and d the natural ordered generalization), although
our construction is general.
    Given a, b ∈ EU we say that a is a refinement of b (see e.g. [22, ch.4 §7]), denoted
a ≤ b, if each part of b is a union of one or more parts of a; i.e. if i ∼a j implies
i ∼b j. It is easy to show that

Proposition 1 Let a, b ∈ EU and U ′ ⊆ U. Then a ≤ b implies a|U ′ ≤ b|U ′ .



                                            3
   For S = EU we define S (T ) to be the subset of T S given by the elements
                                                         Q
a = (at : t ∈ T ) for which t ≤ t′ implies at is a refinement of at′ . We call any such
                                                                           (2)
a ∈ S (T ) a T –ramified partition. For example ({{1}, {2}}, {{1, 2}}) ∈ E{1,2} .

                                                                              (T )
Proposition N2 For any d–tuple Q = (Q1 , .., Qd ) ∈ k d , the set pn                 is a basis for a
subalgebra of t∈T Pn (Qt ).
                                                (T )
Proof: It is enough to show that if a, b ∈ pn then d(at bt ) is a refinement of d(at′ bt′ ) if
                                                                         (2)
t ≤ t′ . But if t ≤ t′ then (at , at′ ) and (bt , bt′ ) both appear in pn (where we identify
                                                                                            (2)
2 = {1, 2} with {t, t′ }) so we are done if we can show for {(a, b), (c, d)} ⊆ pn
that d(ac) a refinement of d(bd). Now by proposition 1 it is enough to show that
du (ac) ≤ du (bd). Suppose i ∼du (ac) j and that the connection is established through
some sequence of connections alternately within a and c. Each connection within a
is within b, each connection within c is within d, so i ∼du (bd) j.                          2
                                                                       (T )  (T )      (T )
    Fixing Q as above we denote the k–algebra with basis pn by Pn = Pn (Q).
This is the T –ramified partition algebra.
    Two posets are isomorphic if there is a bijective homomorphism between the
underlying sets which preserves the partial order. It will be evident that the con-
                 (T )
struction of Pn depends on the partial order, but not on the names of the elements
of T . Thus Pn is defined for poset T with any underlying set, and T ∼
                (T )
                                                                                 = T ′ implies
             ′
Pn ∼
  (T )     (T )
       = Pn .
    Not all choices of T are necessarily physically interesting, in the sense of the
motivation discussed in the introduction. From an abstract point of view, as we will
see later, the choice of T as the poset of divisors of a natural number gives rise to
some interesting representations. But we will concentrate largely on T = 2, which
is among the main motivating examples, captures much of the flavour of the general
case (consider the proof of proposition 2), and already has a very rich structure.
    Refinement equips any EU , and in particular pn , with the property of lattice.
The bottom element {U} is called the trivial partition.

2.2     Examples and notations
Putting T = {1} we recover the partition algebra itself. Recall from [26, §1] the
special elements in basis pn denoted 1, Ai , and Aij as follows:

                         1 = {{1, 1′}, {2, 2′}, .., {i, i′ }, .., {n, n′ }}

Ai differs from 1 by {i, i′ } ; {i}, {i′ }; and Aij differs from 1 by {i, i′ }, {j, j ′ } ;
{i, i′ , j, j ′ } (see also the inner components of figure 2 later). Thus 1 ∈ p1 is {{1, 1′}}
and A1 ∈ p1 is {{1}, {1′}}. See [26, §1] also for the partition algebra diagram
calculus.
     The next simplest case is T = 2. An example of the 2–ramified partition algebra
product is illustrated in figure 1 (the formal interpretation of this diagram is given
                              (2)
shortly). The basis p1 consists of three elements: (1, 1) = ({{1, 1′}}, {{1, 1′}});
(A1 , 1) = ({{1}, {1′}}, {{1, 1′}}); and (A1 , A1 ) = ({{1}, {1′}}, {{1}, {1′}}). Note
that {(A1 , A1 )} is a basis for an ideal, as is {(A1 , A1 ), (A1 , 1)} — see later.
     It is convenient to introduce a ‘serial’ shorthand notation and also a diagram
                      (d)
calculus for Pn . The shorthand for a 2–ramified partition is to write out the
more refined (‘inner’) partition and then to group the parts to indicate the less

Figure 1: The algebra product in P3 in an example: ab = Q1 c. Diagrams for a and
b (drawn one above the other on the left) are juxtaposed to overlay and identify the
vertices indicated by dotted lines, and these vertices are then removed in exchange
for an appropriate scalar factor (cf. [26, §1]).

                                                                                  (2)
refined (‘outer’) partition by using another nest of brackets. Thus in p1 , (1, 1) =
{{{1, 1′}}}, (A1 , 1) = {{{1}, {1′}}}, and (A1 , A1 ) = {{{1}}, {{1′ }}}. There is an
obvious generalization for T any chain.
    The diagram calculus applies the same principle to partition algebra diagrams
(in these the elements of n,n′ are represented as two rows of vertices arranged with
i′ vertically below i, so composition involves vertical juxtaposition). Inner parts are
indicated by ‘hard wiring’ vertices together as in ordinary partition algebra diagrams.
Outer parts are indicated by drawing ‘islands’ around clusters of connected vertices.
See figure 1 for some examples. Note by equation (1) that inner (outer) clusters
isolated from the exterior in composition are replaced by a factor Q1 (resp. Q2 ). As
for Pn (Q), there will not be a strictly planar representation in general. Consider
also the elements in figure 2, and note that

 (Ai , Ai )(Aij , Aij )(Ai , Ai ) = (Ai , Ai )
                                             (Aij , Aij )(Ai , Ai )(Aij , Aij ) = (Aij , Aij ).
                                                                                             (2)
                                                     (2)
    It will be evident from the diagrams that Pn is isomorphic to its opposite
(indeed this is clearly true for any T ). We denote the image of an element a under
this isomorphism by ao (as a diagram it is reflected top to bottom).

2.3        Canonical inclusions
Let Sn denote the symmetric group on n. By Sn ֒→ Pn we denote the natural
monomorphism (and here, as usual, we write σi for the 2–cycle (i i+1) ∈ Sn , and
write σij for the 2–cycle (ij)).
   For t ∈ T define

                                               prt : pn(T ) → pn
                                       (a1 , a2 , . . . , ad ) 7→ at .

Since a ∈ pn is a refinement of itself we have

Figure 2: The multiplicative unit in P4 together with various other elements. In
these examples i = 2 and j = 3. Note that these ‘diagrams’ do not necessarily embed
in the plane in any natural way, and that care must be taken with interpretation of
‘crossing’ lines. Over/under information is not relevant, but may appear in diagrams
as a guide to the eye.

Proposition 3 The diagonal inclusion
                                          D (T ) : pn → pn(T )
                                                    a 7→ (a, a, . . . , a)
(or simply D, where no ambiguity arises) extends to an algebra morphism
                                          D (T ) : Pn (Qπ ) ֒→ Pn(T ) (Q).
For example, set eT = D (T ) (An ), then eT eT = Qπ eT .
                                          (T )       (T )
   There are various ways to inject Pn−1 into Pn . We treat as inclusion that
which appends to every basis element a part which is {n, n′ } at every level of T . For
example, in case T = 2 the map on basis elements is given explicitly by
                                             a 7→ a ∪ {{{n, n′ }}}.

NB, including Pn−1 in Pn in this way means that eT Pn−1 = Pn−1 eT , and hence
         (T )         (T )
that eT Pn is a left Pn−1 –module.
                 In   (2)
    By pn ֒→ pn we denote the inner inclusion of pn , i.e. where the inner partition
in In(p) is p and the outer partition is trivial.
    Note that the serial notation for a 2–ramified partition is unique if written out so
that at each step the numerically lowest possible element not yet written is written
next (for which purpose take i′ = n + i).
    Let us now fix the case T = 2 until further notice.

3.1     Filtration by ideals
For a partition a ∈ pn (or any restriction thereof) let π(a) be the set of propagating
parts of a, i.e. those intersecting both n and n′ . Then the propagating number
                                      (2)
#P (a) := |π(a)| (see [26]). For a ∈ pn let #P (a) ∈ N0 ×N0 denote (#P (a1 ), #P (a2 )),
and similarly for any T .
                (2)
    For a ∈ pn let the propagating index #− (a) be the list of #P (a1 |q ) over all
q ∈ π(a2 ) arranged so that #− (a)i ≥ #− (a)i+1 . For example, the three 2–ramified
partitions illustrated in figure 1 have #− (a) = (1, 1), #− (b) = (1, 0, 0), #− (c) =
(1, 0). Note that the values taken by the propagating index differ from integer
partitions only in that there may be zero parts.
    A generalization of the propagating index may be formulated for other choices
of T , but we will not pursue the point here.
                                                (2)                                    (2)
    For λ a propagating index we denote by pn (λ) the subset of elements a ∈ pn
such that #− (a) = λ.
    The propagating envelope #env (a) is i f (#− (a)i ) where f (0) = 1 and f (j) = j
                                           P
                                                                                (2)
otherwise. This number is the minimum n required so that there is some b ∈ pn with
#− (b) = #− (a). For example #− ({{{1, 2}, {1′, 2′ }}}) = (0), so #env ({{{1, 2}, {1′, 2′}}}) =
1; and a, b, c from figure 1 have #env (a) = 2, #env (b) = 3, #env (c) = P
                                                                         2.
    NB, #P and #env are determined by #− (specifically #P (a1 ) = i #− (a)i and
                                                                    (2)
#P (a2 ) is the number of (integer) parts of #− (a)). The basis pn is fixed, and #−
is invariant, under the opposite isomorphism.
    We denote by pn (i) the subset of elements a ∈ pn such that #P (a) = i. Recall

Proposition 4 [26] Let a ∈ pn (i) and b ∈ pn (i′ ). Then there exist c, d ∈ pn such
that a = cbd iff i ≤ i′ .

This is a powerful tool in the analysis of Pn (Q). The next few propositions build up
to a T = 2 generalization (proposition 8).

Proposition 5 The subset Gn of elements of the types illustrated in figure 2 (or
equivalently {(A1 , 1), (A1, A1 ), (1, A12 ), (A12 , A12 )}∪{(σi , σi ); i = 1, 2, ..., n−1}) gen-
         (2)
erates Pn .

    Proof: Let a be an element of the defining basis. We construct it as a product
                                                                         (T )
of elements of Gn as follows. Step 1 is to construct an element of pn with ‘enough’
propagating connections to act as a base for the construction of a. For non–empty
q ⊆ n, q ′ ⊆ n′ let l(q ∪ q ′ ) (resp. l′ (q ∪ q ′ )) be the numerically lowest unprimed
                                                          (2)
(resp. primed) element of the argument. For a ∈ pn let π1 (a) = π(a1 ) and π2 (a) =
{q ∈ π(a2 ) | q ∩ r = ∅ ∀r ∈ π(a1 )}. Let Xt (a) = ∪q∈πt (a) {l(q), l′ (q)}, and X o (a) =
X1 (a) ∪ X2 (a) — the union of the set of low numbered pairs for inner propagating
parts of a and the set of low numbered pairs for outer propagating parts containing
no inner propagating parts. Now consider the set of basis elements of the form
                  D    (T )
w ∈ Sn ֒→ Pn ֒→ Pn , i.e. those generated by the (σi , σi )s. Note that there is
always at least one such w which restricts, on X o (a), to the same pairings as a does
(albeit diagonally). Choose any one such w. Step 2: Apply (Ai , Ai )s so as to cut all
the connections not on X o (a). Step 3: Take the resultant basis element and make
all the additional outer connections required for a, i.e. those within n and those
within n′ , using (1, Aij )s from the left and right as appropriate. Step 4: Make the
additional inner connections for a using (Aij , Aij )s as appropriate (NB, these will

make the required inner disconnections, i.e. between those pairs in X o (a) referring
to outer but not inner propagating parts, using (Ai , 1)s.                          2

(i) #P (d(ab))t ≤ min(#P (a)t , #P (b)t ) ∀t ∈ T.

And for T = 2

suitable i.

Proof: The first claim is elementary in as much as it holds in Pn , and Pn ⊇ Pn .
The second and third follow from the fact that each propagating part of a1 is a
subset of a propagating part of a2 . To demonstrate (iv) let #env

trouser legs (outer propagating parts) containing no legs (inner propagating parts),
then #env (a) = #P (a1 ) + #env
                              0 (a). The first summand is non–increasing in any
product by (i). The second summand may increase, but by (i) case t = 2 if it does
so then for each new empty trouser (increase of one) there must be at least one
non-empty trouser lost, so the first summand must decrease by at least one.       2

    Let Λ denote the set of possible propagating indices λ. We write λ = (λ1 , λ2 , ...)
for λ ∈ Λ expressed in the exponent notation (i.e. a repeated component is replaced
by an exponent recording the number of repeats, thus (1, 1, 1) = (13 ) and so on).

be understood as the empty list). Each Nm     0 has a natural action of Sm upon it
(permuting the indices), and each Sm orbit in Nm   0 has a unique element which is a

λ. This is called the dominant element. If we equate a λ with an element µ of Nm      0
we will always intend the dominant element in the orbit of µ.
     We define a partial order ≤ on Λ as follows. First write a relation λ′ ρλ if
(0) λ′ = λ; or
(i) λ′ = (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λi−1 , λi − 1, λi+1 , ...); or
(ii) λ′ = (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λi−1, λi + λj , λi+1 , ..., λj−1, λj+1, ...).
Now write λ′ ≤ λ for the transitive completion of this relation (it is manifestly
antisymmetric). Note that in case (i) #P (λ) − #P (λ′ ) = (1, 0); and in case (ii)
#P (λ) − #P (λ′ ) = (0, 1).
     Examples: () ≤ λ for all λ and, fixing n, (1n ) ≥ λ for all λ. The poset is not in
general a lattice. The Hasse diagram starts as in figure 4.
                                (2)
Proposition 7 For a, b ∈ pn , #− (d(ab)) ≤ #− (a).

Proof: It is enough to show the result true for a or b a generator (as in proposition 5).
But multiplication by a generator only implements one of (0)–(ii) above.               2
                                (2)         (2)
Proposition 8 Put P = Pn and p = pn .
(i) Let a ∈ p(λ) and b ∈ p(λ′ ). Then there exist c, d ∈ p such that a = cbd iff λ ≤ λ′ .
(ii) ∪λ′ ≤λ p(λ′ ) is a basis for P Iλ P .
(iii) λ′ ≥ λ if and only if P Iλ′ P ⊇ P Iλ P .

Proof: (i) The only if part follows from proposition 7.
    For each suitable i, there is an outer part of b with λ′i inner propagating parts.
For each such i, consider acting on b with (Aj , Aj )s so as to break up inner parts,
until only the lowest numbered primed and unprimed elements in each inner propa-
gating part remain connected (i.e., in a total of λ′i primed/unprimed pairs). Note by
proposition 4 that this process is reversible (for example if j was in the same inner
part as k then (Ajk , Ajk ) acting on the left would restore the connection). Then act
with (σij , σij )s until these lowest numbered elements coincide with the correspond-
ing data for Iλ′ . This step is reversible since σij is an involution. If λ = λ′ then a
may also be taken reversibly to Iλ′ . To obtain c and d simply compose the series of
generators taking b to Iλ then the reverses which would take Iλ to a.
    Finally, by definition, if λ < λ′ then we can move from λ′ to λ by a sequence of
relations ρ of types (i) and (ii). Note that Iλ′ may be taken to an element of pn (λ)
by a sequence of multiplications by generators which tracks this.
    It will be evident that (i) implies (ii) implies (iii).                          2
    An element a of a k–algebra is a pre–idempotent if there exists α ∈ k such that
αa is idempotent.

    For λ ∈ Λ \ {()} define Iλ′ ∈ pn whose inner partition is given by prinner (Iλ′ ) =
prinner (Iλ ); and whose outer partition agrees with prouter (Iλ ) except on the tail of
non–propagating parts (if any), whose elements are instead included in the last (i.e.
rightmost as in figure 3) propagating part.
                                         (2)
Proposition 9 Again put P = Pn and suppose Q1 invertible in k. Then each Iλ′
is pre–idempotent, and these pre–idempotents commute with each other, and obey

                                         P Iλ′ P = P Iλ P.

Proof: Note that each prinner (Iλ′ ) may be expressed in the form j∈J Aj for some
                                                                                Q
J, and hence is pre–idempotent in Pn (Q1 ) provided that Q1 invertible. Further, the
elements Q  of Pn of this form commute. Meanwhile prouter (Iλ′ ) may be expressed in
the form (i,j)∈J Aij for some J, and hence is idempotent in Pn (Q2 ). Again, all such
elements of Pn commute with each other. Thus the set of objects Iλ′ are commuting

pre–idempotents in Pn , and hence also in Pn .
     Now Iλ′ differs from Iλ only in the tail (if any) of pairs of parts of the outer
partition of the form {j}{j ′ }. If λ 6= () then this is preceded by at least one
propagating part. Let {. . . (j − 1)(j − 1)′ } be the last such. Then A(j−1) j {. . . (j −
1)(j − 1)′ }{j}{j ′}A(j−1) j = {. . . (j − 1)(j − 1)′ jj ′ } and Aj {. . . (j − 1)(j − 1)′ jj ′ }Aj =
{. . . (j − 1)(j − 1)′ }{j}{j ′ } establishing the equality of ideals.                              2

                                                                       (2)
by λ ∈ Λm implies #P (prinner (a)) + #P (prouter (a)) = m for any a ∈ pn (λ). For
example, (0, 0), (1) ∈ Λ2 .

Proposition 10 P   There exist idempotents Im such that
      (2)  (2)             (2)     (2)
(i) Pn Im Pn = λ∈Λm Pn Iλ′ Pn for all m; and
       (2)     (2)    (2)      (2)
(ii) Pn Im+1 Pn ⊃ Pn Im Pn for all m = 1, . . . , 2n − 1.

Proof: Given a pair (ex , ey ), say, of commuting idempotents in an algebra A one may
construct an orthogonal pair (ex (1 − ey ), ey ) and hence an idempotent ex − ex ey + ey .
Clearly A(ex − ex ey + ey )A ⊇ Aex (ex − ex ey + ey )A + Aey (ex − ex ey + ey )A =
Aex A + Aey A (saturating the inequality) — NB, sums inside and outside of brackets
have different meanings here. Applying this process as many times as necessary to
the idempotents with λ ∈ Λm (noting proposition 9) we obtain our candidate for Im
satisfying (i). For (ii), observe that every λ ∈ Λm (m < 2n) obeys λ < λ′ for some
λ′ ∈ Λm+1 .                                                                            2
                                                             ′
    Suppose that Q1 Q2 is invertible in k. Then Iλ and Iλ are pre–idempotent (this
being so we will not further labour the distinction between Iλ and its idempotent
form). It is clear in this case that I() is a heredity idempotent in the sense of [8] (or
see [26]).
                        (2)
Proposition 11 Pn is quasi-hereditary with heredity chain (I2n , I2n−1 , . . . , I1 , I() ).
                          (2)   (2)       (2)
Proof: Write Pi for Pn /Pn Ii−1 Pn . Given proposition 10 it remains to show: (i)
that subalgebra Ii Pn Ii is semi–simple in Pi ; and (ii) that Pn Ii ⊗Ii Pn(2) Ii Ii Pn ∼

                                                                                         =

Pn Ii Pn       in Pi . A basis for Pi is ∪λ∈Λi pn (λ). It follows from proposition 7 that

                                           (2)
diagram becomes an element of the basis p14 ((3, 22 , 13, 0)) ∩ Iλ P Iλ ). The shading
here is a guide to the eye only.

                                                               (2)
the product of any two basis elements not from the same pn (λ) is zero in Pi . For
                                             (2)
(i), one then notes that the subalgebra Ii Pn Ii will break up as a direct sum with
                         (2)
summands of form Iλ Pn Iλ . The basis of this algebra given by its intersection with
the given basis of Pi (illustrated in figure 5) is closed under multiplication, with
multiplicative unit Iλ , and invertible elements. Thus this algebra is isomorphic to
a group algebra. (We will identify the group in section 3.3.)
    For (ii), one considers the obvious map

                                   (aIi , Ii b) 7→ aIi b

in terms of basis elements. Again, since the {Iλ } are orthogonal (in Pi ) it is enough
to consider (aIλ , Iλ b) 7→ aIλ b. As written, this requires that the kernel coincides
                                                               (2)
with elements of the form (ac, b) − (a, cb) where c ∈ Ii Pn Ii . The kernel clearly
includes this set, so it is enough to show that it is no larger. The map is realizable
at the level of basis elements, from which the extent of the kernel is immediate, as
follows.
                               (2)
     Let q be an element of pn (λ) ∩ P Iλ (which set is a basis for P Iλ in Pi ), and a
                 (2)
an element of pn (λ) ∩ Iλ P Iλ (similarly a basis for Iλ P Iλ ). Up to a scalar qa is in
 (2)
pn (λ) ∩ P Iλ and the map

                           p(2)                (2)
                            n (λ) ∩ Iλ P Iλ → pn (λ) ∩ P Iλ

given in this way by a 7→ qa is injective for any q (again consider figure 5, for
                                             (2)
example). Define an equivalence relation on pn (λ) ∩ P Iλ by q ∼ q ′ if qa = q ′ for
some a as above. Let q ∼ be a set of representatives of equivalence classes. Then

                                           11
                    (2)
each element of pn (λ) ∩ P Iλ may be written uniquely in the form qa where q ∈ q ∼
(i.e. (q, a) 7→ qa is a bijection).
    The same argument works on the right.                                       2

3.3     Left ideals, sections and special modules
      (2)
Let Pn [λ] denote the λ section in the filtration given by proposition 8(ii) (i.e. with
       (2)           (2)                              (2)
basis pn (λ)). Let Pn [λ]′ denote the image of Pn Iλ in this section (cf. [26, §3]).
                                       (2)                            (2)
The algebra which is the image of Iλ Pn Iλ in this section acts on Pn [λ]′ from the
                                          (2)             (2)
right. So in addition to being a left Pn –module Pn [λ]′ is also a right module
for the group algebra of a permutation group S[λ] whose action is to permute the
primed sides of outer propagating parts with the same number of inner propagating
parts; and to permute the primed elements of inner propagating parts within each
outer propagating part — thus
                                         Y
                                S[λ] =        Sλi ≀ Sλi
                                                i

(consider the action from below of S1 × S2 × S3 × S1 on outer and S3 × (S2 × S2 ) ×
                                                            (2)
(S1 × S1 × S1 ) × S0 on inner parts in figure 3). Indeed, Pn [λ]′S[λ] is a sum of copies
of the right regular module. Thus if LΘ is a simple left kS[λ]–module we may define
         (2)
a left Pn –module
                          SΘ = SΘ (n) = Pn(2) [λ]′ ⊗kS[λ] LΘ .
                                                (2)                                             (2)
This is an indecomposable summand of Pn [λ]′ and hence a standard module of Pn
(in the quasi–hereditary sense).
                              (2)                                          (2)
    Evidently, every simple Pn –module appears as a subquotient of some Pn [λ]′ ,
and each Pn [λ]′ is a sum of modules of form SΘ , with SΘ ∼ = SΘ′ iff LΘ ∼
             (2)
                                                                         = LΘ′ .
                      (2)
Thus every simple Pn –module appears as a subquotient of some SΘ . The following
result is well known.
Proposition 12 [23, §I.Appendix B] Let G be a group with CG conjugacy classes.
Then equivalence classes of simple G≀Sn –modules are indexed by CG –tuples of integer
partitions of total degree n. 2
It follows that for each λ there is a distinct inequivalent SΘ for each tuple of mul-
tipartitions (tuples of integer partitions are called multipartitions) in which the ith
multipartition is as specified in the proposition in case Sλi ≀ Sλi .
    Let us denote by Γn the set of all such indices Θ unioned over all λ such that
  env
# (λ) = n. For example, Γ0 consists of a single label ((), say) corresponding to
the nominal irreducible representation of a product over an empty set of wreaths
(it will be evident from the construction that the correct interpretation is as a
single copy of the ground ring); Γ1 consists of labels, (0), (1), say, corresponding to
the single irreducible representations of each of S1 ≀ S0 and S1 ≀ S1 respectively; Γ2
                                  2
consists of labels, (0(2) ), (0(1 ) ) (the irreducibles of S2 ≀ S0 ), (1, 0) (the irreducible
                                          2                                                      2
of (S1 ≀ S1 ) × (S1 ≀ S0 )), (1(2) ), (1(1 ) ) (irreducibles of S2 ≀ S1 ), (1, 1)(2) and (1, 1)(1 )
(irreducibles of S1 ≀ S2 ), say. See figure 6 for more examples.
                                                                                  (T )
    Note that the kS[λ] action may be realized as a subalgebra of Pn in a similar
way to kSn . The extra structure in kS[λ] is just so that it commutes with Iλ . When
                                                         (T )
we confuse elements of kS[λ] with elements of Pn it will be through this realization.

                                                12
Since kS[λ] is a group algebra we may take it semisimple for k a suitable field of
characteristic 0 (such as C). Let eΘ then be a primitive idempotent of kS[λ] such
that kS[λ]eΘ = LΘ and eΘ kS[λ]eΘ = keΘ . We may define an inner product < | >
on SΘ by
                                < a|b > eΘ Iλ = ao b
(to be understood in the λ section, which makes the opposite right module to SΘ
also a dual).
    For example, I() = ni=1 (An , An ) and S[()] = S0 which here means the trivial
                         Q
group (so there is only one irreducible representation and e() = 1). A basis for
  (T )                 (T )
Pn I() is {wx | w ∈ En , x = {{{1′ }}, {{2′}}, ..., {{n′}}}}. Thus the gram matrix
G() of the inner product with respect to this basis has rows and columns conveniently
               (T )
indexed by En . The abth entry of G() is i Qhi i where hi is the number of parts
                                             Q
in ai bi (the normal composition of partitions). In particular for n = 2 the λ = ∅
module has gram matrix computed as follows:




                                   Q2  2         Q1 Q2
                                    1 Q2             2      Q1 Q2




                                   Q1 Q2
                                       2         Q1 Q2
                                                     2
                                                            Q1 Q2




                                   Q1 Q2         Q1 Q2      Q1 Q2




whereupon
                                     3 4
                           |Gn=2
                             () | = Q1 Q2 (Q1 − 1)(Q2 − 1).

Similarly we have (for the dimension twelve module at n = 3)
                          12 20                        7        7
                |Gn=3
                  () | = Q1 Q2 (Q1 − 2)(Q2 − 2)(Q1 − 1) (Q2 − 1)

and (for the dimension 60 module at n = 4)
                60 119                       13       11       45       48
      |Gn=4
        () | = Q1 Q2 (Q1 − 3)(Q2 − 3)(Q1 − 2) (Q2 − 2) (Q1 − 1) (Q2 − 1) .

What is striking about these results is that the determinants factorise over Z[Q1 ] ∪
Z[Q2 ] rather than C[Q1 , Q2 ] 2 .
  2
    Indeed, computing the determinant of a common or garden 60x60 matrix with entries poly-
nomial in 2 variables is probably beyond the reach of modern computers. We used the GAP
package[17], some lucky guesses and some saturated bounds to reduce to a few tens of minutes
computation on a powerful laptop.


                                            13
Proposition 13 For all n the module S() is generically simple.
Proof: Consider G() for n arbitrary. It is enough to show that this is non–singular
on an open subset of parameter space. Recall that the composition of partitions
required to compute the inner product involves a transitive closure. It follows that
the diagonal entry in each row of G() is always of (possibly equal) highest total
degree. Consider the matrix obtained by deleting the rows (and columns) where
it is uniquely of highest degree. Iterating this procedure (cf. [29]) we arrive at
the empty matrix. It follows that the determinant of the gram matrix is a finite
polynomial in Q1 , Q2 . 2

3.4    Modules SΘ (n) with #env (Θ) = n
Let us extend the definition of #env so #env (Θ) = #env (λ), where λ is the propagat-
                                                                          (2)
ing index underlying Θ. Then ‘modules SΘ with #env (Θ) = n’ are the Pn –modules
SΘ whose canonical basis elements have propagating index which cannot be realized
     (2)
in Pn−1 . They also obey

                           D (T ) (Ai )SΘ = D (T ) (Aij )SΘ = 0
for all i, j, whereas no SΘ with #env (Θ) < n has this property (for, in this case we
may construct a basis element from a basis element for the equivalent module at
level n − 1 by a 7→ a ∪ {{{n}}, {{n′}}} — and this is not killed by D (T ) (An )).
Proposition 14 If #env (Θ) = n and Qinner invertible in k then SΘ (n) is simple.
Proof: Consider the gram matrix as constructed in the previous section. Because
of the quotient (we are in the λ section) we may apply the pigeonhole principle to
see that the inner product < a|b > between any two basis elements is zero unless
each outer part of a meets only one outer part of bo in the composition. Thus the
gram matrix breaks up into blocks indexed by the possible arrangements of outer
parts in the restriction of a to n′ (or equivalently the restriction of bo to n), and
this arrangement characterizes all the products in the block. Since #env (Θ) = n
this implies that, in a block, each outer part from a meeting one from bo carries
the same number of inner propagating lines. Within the block, then, up to overall
factors of Qinner , the inner product coincides with that of the corresponding simple
kS[λ]–module. Each block determinant is therefore the same, and non–zero. Hence
the whole gram matrix is non–singular. 2

3.5    Generic representation theory
                                                    (T )
For any T recall that eT commutes with Pn−1 , and that eT eT = Qπ eT . Thus
                      Q
Proposition 15 For t∈T Qt invertible in k,

                           eT Pn(T ) eT = Pn−1 eT ∼
                                           (T )      (T )
                                                  = Pn−1                          (3)
is an algebra isomorphism; and
                                 (T )
                           G : Pn−1 –mod → Pn(T ) –mod
                                        M 7→               Pn(T ) eT M
                        (T )            (T )
is a full embedding of Pn−1 –mod in Pn –mod [16, §6.2] (cf. [26]).

                                               14
                   (2)           (2)
   Note that G(Pn−1 Iλ ) = Pn Iλ (NB, strictly speaking Iλ is a different object on
each side of this equation, i.e. depending on the level n; it is this ‘globalization’
identity which justifies omission of the n label).
   By equation (3), it is the quotient

                                 P [n] := Pn(T ) /Pn(T ) eT Pn(T )

whose representations will be missed in the embedding (or equivalently, those left
modules M for which eT .M = 0). Thus
                         (T )
Proposition 16 If Λn is an index set for the equivalence classes of simple modules
      (T )
of Pn then
        (T )
(i) |Λ0 | = 1;
and if Q1 Q2 invertible in k then
        (2)  (2)
(ii) Λn = Λn−1 ∪ Γn = ∪0≤i≤n Γi , and
                         (2)
(iii) {head SΘ | Θ ∈ Λn } is a complete set of representatives of the equivalence
                                (2)
classes of simple modules of Pn .

    In other words, the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations is
indexed by the possible values of #− together with the corresponding set of tuples
of multipartitions described in section 3.3.
    Recall [27, §2.2] that Pnm is the subalgebra of Pn+m in which each of the nodes
labelled n + 1, . . . , n + m is identified with its primed partner. The algebras Pnm
                                               (T )m                       (T ) (T )1
generalize in a natural way to algebras Pn           (any T ), whereupon Pn ⊂ Pn ⊂
  (T )                                      (T )
Pn+1 . The chain of inclusions from P0 upward obtained from this sequence is
           (T )
denoted P∗ .
                                                                          (2)
    As for restriction rules, it will be clear that the module S() in P2n restricts to
                                   (2)

                                      Pn

and so on. The first few layers are depicted in figure 6. We do not need the general
result here, but see proposition 20.
                               (T )
    Given a module M ∈ Pn−1 –mod there is a globalization functor G and, via the
               (T )       (T )
injection of Pn−1 into Pn , an induction functor Ind acting on it, so that GM
                     (T )
and IndM are in Pn –mod for any n. In writing down such modules, we will not
generally give an explicit indication of the level n unless it is seems helpful to do so.
    We now assemble the tools for proving generic semisimplicity. By construction
(or using [10]) we have

Proposition 17
                                       GSλ (n) ∼
                                               = Sλ (n + 1)
Recall [9]

Proposition 18 Projective modules of quasi–hereditary algebras have filtrations by
standard modules.

We denote the multiplicity in this filtration by [Pλ : Sµ ]. The following is readily
proved (cf. [26]):

Proposition 19 For M ∈ Pn             − mod,

                               Resn+2     ∼    n+1

                                         = GInd M.                                  (4)
Thus if Sλ (n) is projective for all n then so is Res Sλ (n). Whereupon
Proposition 20 [Res Sλ : Sµ ] 6= 0 implies #env (λ) − #env (µ) ∈ {−1, 0, +1}.
                                        (2)
                                               (2)
Proof: Consider the restriction ResPn(2) Pn [λ̂]′ where λ̂ is such that Sλ is a summand.
                                       Pn−1
        (2)
Since Pn [λ̂]′ is a direct sum of Sλ s all with the same #env , it is enough to show an
equivalent result for this module.
                      (2)
    In our basis of Pn [λ̂]′ the elements conform to one of the following possibilities
for the connectivity of node n (the distinguished node, as it were, on restriction).
(1a) Node n is the sole unprimed element in a propagating part (inner not outer)
                                                                 (2)
— this contributes to a basis for a module isomorphic to Pn−1 [λ′ ]′ with λ′ ρλ̂ via a
ρ–step of type (i) (i.e. with #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ) − 1).
(1b) Node n is the sole unprimed element in a propagating part (inner and outer)
— this means that #P (λ̂) includes a singleton, and the situation is as above except
that this singleton has disappeared in λ′ . Again #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ) − 1.
(1c) Node n is the sole unprimed element in a propagating part (outer not inner) —
this time #P (λ̂) includes a zero element and the situation is as above except that
this has disappeared in λ′ . Again #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ) − 1.
(2a) Node n is a singleton both with respect to inner and outer partitions — the set
                                                               (2)
of such objects forms a basis for a module isomorphic to Pn−1 [λ̂]′ .
(2b) Node n is connected, but in such a way that regarding it as primed (for the
purpose of determining the propagating index) does not change the propagating
index (i.e. both the inner and outer part in which it lies have other nodes of both
primed and unprimed type). Again sets of such objects form bases for modules
                  (2)
isomorphic to Pn−1 [λ̂]′ , provided we quotient by the modules produced at (1abc)
above.
(3a) Node n is in a part (inner not outer) containing only unprimed elements — in
the restriction there is no action on this node, so, quotienting by all the modules
discussed so far, it may be regarded much as if it were primed. Thus we can build
                                   (2)
a basis for a copy of a module Pn−1 [λ′ ]′ where λ′ is such that one element of #P (λ′ )
is incremented by 1 compared to #P (λ), and hence #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ) + 1.
(3b) Node n is in a part (inner and outer) containing only unprimed elements — as
above, except that #P (λ′ ) has a new singleton element. Again #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ)+
1.
(3c) Node n is in a part (outer not inner) containing only unprimed elements — as
above, except that #P (λ′ ) has a new zero element. Again #env (λ′ ) = #env (λ) + 1.

                (2)
Theorem 1 Pn (Q) is generically semisimple.

Proof: Let Propλ be that Sλ = Pλ = Sλ , the simple module, for all n (i.e. this
module lies in a singleton block). Then we are done if Propλ true for all λ. Suppose
it is true for all {λ | #env (λ) ≤ m}. Work by induction on m. The base case is

                                               17
m = 0, which is true generically by proposition 13 using quasi-heredity and Brauer–
Humphreys reciprocity [9].
    Applying equation (4) to case M = 1, n = 0 we see that every standard module
with #env (ν) ≤ m appears in the mth induction (and hence also the mth restriction)
of S() . Thus for each ν with #env (ν) = m+1 there is a λ with #env (λ) = m such that
[Res Sλ : Sν ] 6= 0. We now use this λ and the inductive assumptions to establish
Propν .
    Consider the Frobenius reciprocity

                      Homn+1 (Ind Sκ , Sλ ) ∼
                                            = Homn (Sκ , Res Sλ )                    (5)

By proposition 20, if #env (κ) ≥ m + 2 then this space is empty (since it is empty
on the left by the inductive assumption). On the other hand, by assumption, all
the indecomposable summands Pχ of Res Sλ are simple except possibly those with
#env (χ) = m + 1. But suppose some Sφ a submodule of Pχ . Then it is simple
by equation (5) and quasi–heredity (the only possible maps into it would show up
in equation (5) for some κ), and so φ = χ, and indeed Pχ is simple by Brauer–
Humphreys reciprocity and quasi–heredity. Thus in particular our Sν = Pν = Sν .

4     Exceptional representations
Fix Q ∈ N and let VQ denote the k–space with basis {e1 , . . . , eQ }. Then for each
ordinary partition algebra Pn (Q) there a Qn –dimensional Potts representation R
acting on V = VQ⊗n . This is described, for example, in [28] (see also below). The
underlying idea is that each basis element of V is a colouring of the n lattice sites
({1, ..., Q} being the colours), and that such a colouring is ‘consistent’ with a given
partition of the sites only if the elements within each part in the partition have
the
N same colour. Fixing Q a function from T to N, the tensor product algebra
   t Pn (Qt ) may be equipped with a corresponding    product representation. It will
                                         Q      n
be evident that this representation is ( t Qt ) –dimensional. ThisQis to say, it acts
on a space isomorphic to thatQof the Potts representation of Pn ( t Qt ) (recall the
‘diagonal’ isomorphism of Pn ( t Qt ) to a subalgebra of our algebra). We will again
                                         N                                       (T )
write R both for this representation of t Pn (Qt ) and for its restriction to Pn .
                                                                         (T )
Theorem 2 For any Q ∈ Nd there exists an m ∈ N such that Pn (Q) is non–
semisimple for all n > m.
Proof: The proof is a straightforward generalization of the corresponding result for
the ordinary partition algebra as in [29]. In short, one compares the growth rate
(as n increases) of dimension of standard module S() with that of the Potts repre-
sentation R, having established that, if semisimple, the former is a summand of the
latter (consider R(I() )).                                                        2



4.1    Application to physical models
For H a graph let EH (resp. VH ) denote its edge (resp. vertex) set. Define graph Al
by VAl = {1, 2, .., l} and EAl = {{i, j}|i−j = ±1}, and graph Âl by VÂl = {1, 2, .., l}
and EÂl = {{i, j}|i − j ≡ ±1 mod. l}, as usual.

                                           18
    Fix Q ∈ N. A spin configuration on graph H is an element of SH = hom(VH , {1, 2, .., Q})
(i.e. a colouring of the vertices of H from Q colours). For s ∈ SH let si denote the
‘colour’ of vertex i.
    Given a graph H let graph G = H × Al be given by VH×Al = VH × VAl and
{(a, b), (c, d)} ∈ EH×Al if either a = c and {b, d} ∈ EAl or b = d and {a, c} ∈ EH .
We may break graph G up in to l ‘lateral’ layers Hk (k = 1, 2, .., l) each isomorphic
to H, and l − 1 ‘transverse’ layers Hk,k+1 each consisting of the edges between a
certain pair of lateral layers.
    A Q–state model on G may be constructed as follows [2, 24]. An edge Hamiltonian
H is a map from hom(VA2 , {1, 2, .., Q}) to the real numbers (here A2 stands for any
of the 2 vertex subgraphs of G containing precisely one edge). From this we form
graph Hamiltonian                        X
                                 HG =        H(si , sj ).
                                         {i,j}∈EG

Given such a function and a complex variable β define the partition function
                                     X
                         Z = Z(β) =      exp(βHG (s)).
                                            s∈SG


In Statistical Mechanics one wants to know the analytic structure of Z(β). 3 If the
Hamiltonian H(si , sj ) is integer valued then, regarding Z as a function of exp(β),
this structure consists of roots. (More generally of limits of distributions of roots as
l and H grow large in some way.)
                       (l)
    For s, t ∈ SH let Tst denote the partition function in case the colours of vertices
in H1 (resp. Hl ) have been fixed to s (resp. t). Note that, given a bijection
VH ↔ {1, 2, .., n}, SH is a basis for V in a natural way. Thus T (l) is a matrix in
End(V ). In case l = 1 the first and last layers are identified, and T (1) is a diagonal
matrix. We may similarly introduce a matrix T (−) of partition functions associated
to a single transverse layer Hk,k+1. Here s determines the colour of vertices in layer
k, and t in layer k + 1. These layer matrices are called transfer matrices. Note that
we may use them to build up T (l) one layer at a time:
                                                   l
                                T (l) = T (1) T (−) T (1) .

Similarly, we can introduce matrices which will build up T (1) and T (−) one edge at
a time.
    For certain choices of H(si , sj ) the representation R can be used to build these
transfer matrices. The representation R of the full tensor product algebra may be
used to build transfer matrices for models with Q     a significantly greater variety of
                                                                                   (T )
Hamiltonian than can the restriction of R to Pn ( t Qt ). The point about Pn is
that R may be restricted to it without losing the greater variety. A suitable concrete
example will illustrate these points. Let Q = (Q1 , Q2 ) = (2, 3). Let Dj be the j × j
matrix with all entries 1, and Ij be the j × j unit matrix. Then

                       R((Ai , Ai )) = I6i−1 ⊗ DQ1 ⊗ DQ2 ⊗ I6n−i−2

                        R((Ai , 1)) = I6i−1 ⊗ DQ1 ⊗ IQ2 ⊗ I6n−i−2
   3
    Actually Z will only be physically interesting, within the framework described, for certain
carefully chosen G and H; and interesting constructions are possible outside of this framework.
Neither point need concern us here.

                                              19
(cf. [2, §12.4]).
    The colour–valued variables si associated to the vertices i of G are called spins.
Note that R above acts on a space appropriate for a Q1 Q2 =6–state model. Consid-
ering spins si as taking values from the integers mod. 6, then a Z6 –symmetric model
[2, 12] is one in which the edge Hamiltonian takes the form H(si , sj ) = f (si − sj ),
where f may be any real valued even function 4 . Suppose we want to build the
transfer matrix for such a model with f (0) = 2, f (1) = f (2) = 1, f (3) = 0 (such as
the model examined in [24, p.305]). Then the transfer matrix factor building in the
contribution of that edge to the Hamiltonian is

                   R 1 + (eγ − 1)(Aij , Aij ) 1 + (eβ − 1))(1, Aij )
                                                                     


                  = R 1 + (eβ − 1))(1, Aij ) + eβ (eγ − 1)(Aij , Aij )
                                                                       

if lattice edge (i, j) is in the transfer matrix layer (i.e. it is in some Hk ), and

                      R eβ (eγ − 1)1 + (eβ − 1)(Ai , 1) + (Ai , Ai )
                                                                      


if (i, j) is perpendicular to the transfer matrix layer; where γ = 2, β = −1.
     The analytic structure of the partition function Z for such models reveals physi-
cal phase transitions as points on the positive exp(β)–axis which are approached by
distributions of roots as the system size grows large (see [24] for details). In comput-
ing this structure we are, at base, using the algebra as nothing more than a formal
aid to computation (the globalization functor G gives explicit control of the thermo-
dynamic, i.e. large n, limit as a global algebra limit, but there is no way yet to use
this in specific calculations). None the less, the results are of considerable interest
both in the way they model phase transitions and in what they tell us about specific
physical systems. We will postpone such interpretation to a separate paper but, in
the renaissance spirit, include a couple of results here (in the form of distributions
of roots), for illustration. (There has been renewed interest in results of this kind
recently, although mostly obtained by brute force calculation, see [31].) Figures 7
and 8 show the roots of Z in exp(β) for Q1 = Q2 = 2 and f (0) = 3, f (1) = 1 and
f (2) = 0, for various graphs. The results for various different graphs are shown, as
a rough indication of the sense in which the distribution of roots may approach a
limit as G becomes large. 5 The graphs concerned are given by (H = Â7 , l = 9) and
(H = Â8 , l = 9) and (H = Â8 , l = 13) and (H = Â10 , l = 13) (i.e. these examples
are models of two–dimensional physical systems).


5       Discussion
There remain a number of interesting open problems on the representation theory
                                                                (2)
side. We have not determined the exceptional structure of Pn (cf. Pn , where
complete results are known), nor addressed its representation theory in positive
characteristic (nothing is known here for Pn either, although it is known to be a

     Directed graphs and non–even functions produce chiral models, which have also been studied,
but need not concern us here.

     A better indication is perhaps given by the animated combined version of these figures available

hard problem [30]). As for more exotic posets T , we do not know even the generic
               (T )
structure of Pn (indeed we do not even know if it has a generic structure).

    As a quasi–hereditary algebra, it is natural to ask if Pn has tilting modules [9].
These have yet to be constructed even for Pn .
    The assumptions of this paper restrict us to finite T , however there is no serious
obstruction to relaxing this constraint. Infinite T lacks, for the moment, physical
motivation, however it offers some intriguing possibilities cf. [34] (and references
therein) for example.

The degree of pn , or the set EN of 2–ramified partitions of any finite set N, may
be computed as follows. The shape of a partition (of N say) is the list of degrees of
its parts, expressed as an integer partition. For µ such a shape, let gµ be the number
of partitions with that shape. Let bn be the number of partitions of n. Then
