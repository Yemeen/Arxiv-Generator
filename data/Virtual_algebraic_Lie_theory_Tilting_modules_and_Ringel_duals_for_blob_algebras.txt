                                            1     Introduction
                                            In this paper we construct a representation of the blob algebra [22] over a ring
                                            allowing base change to every interesting (i.e. non–semisimple) specialisation which,
                                            in quasihereditary specialisations, passes to a full tilting module.
                                                 The Temperley–Lieb algebras are a tower T0 (q) ⊂ T1 (q) ⊂ .. of one–parameter
                                            finite dimensional algebras [28], each with a basis independent of q. These algebras
                                            are quasihereditary [3, 8] except in case q+q −1 = 0. Accordingly one may in principle
                                            construct tilting modules, full tilting modules, and corresponding Ringel duals. In
                                            fact, if V is a free module of rank 2 over the ground ring then Tn (q) has an action on
                                            V ⊗n , and it is straightforward to show (see later) that V ⊗n is a full tilting module
                                            in the quasihereditary cases. Since V ⊗n exists over the ground ring, the Ringel dual
                                            can be constructed without having to pick a specialisation. The cases of n finite of
                                            this dual are a nested sequence of quotients of the quantum group Uq sl2 [17, 11].
                                            This q–deformable duality and glorious limit structure [16] (more usually observed
                                            with Uq sl2 as the starting point) provides the mechanism for massive exchange of
                                            representation theoretic information between the two sides [26, 10, 13, 4, 18]. In
                                            particular the weight theory of Uq sl2 controls the representation theory of Tn (q) for
                                            all n simultaneously (as localisations of a global limit).
                                                 The blob algebras are a tower b0 ⊂ b1 ⊂ .. of two–parameter finite dimensional
                                            algebras (and bn ⊃ Tn (q)). They are quasihereditary except at a finite set of param-
                                            eter values. Accordingly one may in principle construct tilting modules and so on.
                                            Ab initio one would have to expect such a construction to depend on the speciali-
                                            sation, as indecomposable tilting modules do [24]. On the other hand, it turns out
                                            [23] that bn has an action on V ⊗2n , and in this paper we show that V ⊗2n is a full
                                            tilting module in the quasihereditary cases.
                                                 Historically, Tn (q) and Uq sl2 were studied extensively separately, before the full
                                            tilting module/Ringel duality connection was known, but if one side, and the ap-
                                            propriate full tilting module, had been discovered first, the passage to the Ringel
                                            dual would rightly have been regarded as quite a significant spin–off! The bn tilt-
                                            ing property of V ⊗2n is a striking result, in as much as it places us in a position
                                            analogous to this (as it were, before the discovery of quantum groups).


                                                                                       1
    Suitably prepared, the blob algebra may be regarded as a quotient of the Ariki–
Koike algebra, which itself is a quotient of the affine Hecke algebra [1, 15]. Thus
the representation theory of the blob algebra is part of the representation theory
of the Ariki–Koike and of the affine Hecke algebra, this last point being the basic
idea of [21, 22] (see also Graham and Lehrer’s analysis [14]). Although V ⊗2n can
be regarded as a module of the Ariki–Koike algebra, it is not in any obvious way
a sum of permutation modules in the usual Ariki–Koike sense [7, 6, 5]. In the
absense of a natural tensor space (cf. [2, 27]), these permutation modules form
the starting point for most tilting related approaches to Ariki–Koike representation
theory. Our approach is of an essentially different nature. In particular it gives a
weight theory (in the sense mentioned above) for bn which, for Ariki–Koike, would
imply a structure which it seems very unlikely to possess (see [23]).
    The blob algebra, and certain generalisations, have been observed to manifest
several indicators of an underlying structure evocative of algebraic Lie theory (such
as the role played in their representation theory by alcove geometry — see [23]). We
wish to understand the underlying reasons for the extra structure. The Temperley–
Lieb paradigm suggests that an appropriately prepared Ringel dual is a good place to
look (hence ‘virtual algebraic Lie theory’). For example, the results of [24] suggest
that this “dual blob algebra” should be reminiscent of the Kac–Moody quantum
            ˆ 2.
algebra Uq sl
    Given the full background, a natural approach to proving that V ⊗n is a tilting
module for Tn (q) is to use the duality itself (that this module is a tilting module
on the dual side is a direct consequence of the general machinery of Donkin [9, 10]
et al [12]). The challenge here is that for the blob no such general machinery yet
exists. Accordingly we include here a proof in the Temperley–Lieb case which does
not appeal to the algebraic Lie theory machinery, but only to quasiheredity. This
exercise is motivated only by the need to understand how such a proof might work,
for use in the blob case. The blob case is then the main object of this paper (see
section 4).

1.1    Preliminaries
The blob algebra bn is usually defined in terms of a certain basis of diagrams and their
compositions [22], from which it derives its name. This blob algebra is isomorphic
to an algebra defined by a presentation [4]. We will only need the presentation.
    For R a commutative ring, x an invertible element in R, q = x2 , and γ, δe ∈ R,
define bR
        n to be the R–algebra with generators {1, e, U1 , ..., Un−1 } and relations

                         Ui Ui = (q + q −1 )Ui                                      (1)
                    Ui Ui±1 Ui = Ui                                                 (2)
                         Ui Uj = Uj Ui                 (|i − j| =
                                                                6 1)                (3)

                        U1 eU1 = γU1
                            ee = δe e
                           Ui e = eUi                  (i 6= 1).
By the isomorphism with the diagram algebra this algebra is a free R–module (with
basis most conveniently described in terms of diagrams, however we do not otherwise
need this basis, so we will not recall it here — see [22]).

                                           2
    It will be evident that e can be rescaled to change γ and δe by the same factor.
Thus, if we require that δe is invertible, then we might as well replace it by 1. (This
brings us to the original two–parameter definition of the algebra.)
    For k a field which is a R–algebra define bn = k ⊗R bRn . It is known [22] that the
representation theory of bn falls into one of three distinct categories, depending on
the number of integer values of a for which

                                    γ[a]q = δe [a − 1]q

(where [a]q is the usual q–number). If there is no solution then bn is semisimple and
has trivial tilting theory. Accordingly it is convenient to reparameterize into the
following form:
                        γ = q m−1 − q −m+1 ,    δe = q m − q −m .                  (4)
Note that provided m is integer (which includes all the interesting cases) this pa-
                                    Z[q,q −1 ]
rameterization has a lattice in bn             (i.e. γ, δe lie in Z[q, q −1 ]).
    Previously used parameterizations include
γ = [m−1]
      [m]
           , δe = 1;
and
γ = ±[m − 1], δe = ±[m]
(see [22], [24], [4] respectively). Our form has the mild disadvantage that it is not a
simple rescaling in case q − q −1 = 0.


2     The ‘crypto–tensor’ representations
We now recall the representations ρχ of bn defined        in [23, §6.1].
  Set                                                       
                                       0 0 0              0
                                      0 q 1              0 
                           U q (χ) = 
                                      0 1 q −1
                                                             
                                                          0 
                                       0 0 0              χ
and U q = U q (0).
    Let V = span{v1 , v2 }. Let seq{1, 2} denote the set of words of finite length
in {1, 2}, seqn {1, 2} the subset of words of length n, and seqrn {1, 2} the subset of
this in which the number of 1s is r. For w ∈ seqn {1, 2} let #1 (w) denote the
number of 1s in w (so w ∈ seqrn {1, 2} implies #1 (w) = r). Then V ⊗n has basis
{vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ .. ⊗ vin | i1 i2 ..in ∈ seqn {1, 2}}. We will adopt the shorthand of writing
the sequence for the basis element. We ascribe the usual lexicographic order to this
basis (11,12,21,22 and so on). Let U q (χ) act on V ⊗ V with respect to this ordering
of the basis.
    Let µq,χ (Ui ) ∈ End(V ⊗n ) be a matrix acting trivially on every tensor factor ex-
cept the ith and (i + 1)th , where it acts as +U q (χ). Write µq (Ui ) for µq,0(Ui ). The
Temperley–Lieb algebra Tn (q) is the subalgebra of bn with generators {1, U1 , ..., Un−1 }.
The tensor space representation of Tn (q) is given by µq .
    Note that
                                                                    

for any r, s, t, χ (an explicit calculation).

                                                3
  Suppose henceforth that there is an element a ∈ K such that a4 = −1. Then
a + a−2 = 0. Set

                                   r = a2 q m
                                                    s = a5 x
                                                    t = a3 x
We have
                                       r + r −1 = a2 (q m − q −m )
                                         s + s−1 = a5 x + a3 x−1
                                         t + t−1 = a3 x + a5 x−1

                                 r     st
         Then by equation (5) there is an algebra homomorphism
                                       −1 ]
                          ρ : bZ[q,q
                               n              (q, m) −→ EndZ[a,x,x−1 ] (V ⊗2n )

given by

                                  ρ : e 7→ a−2 µr (Un )                                        (6)
                                 ρ : Ui 7→ µs (Un−i )µt (Un+i )                                (7)

for bn in the form described in equation (4).
    There is another algebra homomorphism ρ′ defined in exactly the same way
except that

                                       ρ′ : e 7→ a−2 µr,[2]r (Un )                             (8)

   Note that the Tn (q)–module µq has manifest direct summands with basis seqrn {1, 2}
(r = 0, 1, .., n), called permutation modules. Similarly ρ and ρ′ have manifest direct
summands with basis seqr2n {1, 2} which we will again call permutation modules. 1
   Similarly evidently we have

Proposition 1 The following are manifest direct sums (i.e. respecting the basis):

                                        ResTTnn−1 µq = µq ⊕ µq                                 (9)


                                  Resbbnn−1 ρ = ρ ⊕ ρ ⊕ ρ ⊕ ρ                                 (10)
     1
      It should be emphasised that although bn is a quotient of the Hecke algebra of type–B (which
itself is an Ariki–Koike algebra), the above permutation modules do not coincide with the type–B
or Ariki–Koike permutation modules described in [7, 25]: in the notation of [23] the quotient map
sends gi + q to Ui , and so Ui will map a typical Ariki–Koike permutation module basis vector to
a linear combination of precisely two basis vectors (see [7]), which is clearly not the case in our
situation. As a matter of fact, an Ariki–Koike permutation module is typically not a module for
the blob algebra, even if its leading Specht factor is one.

3     A Temperley–Lieb tilting module
The goal of this section is to prove that the tensor space module V ⊗n is a tilting
module for the Temperley–Lieb algebra. This follows from general results (for in-
stance in [10]), but we give here a self–contained argument which later generalizes
to the blob algebra representation ρ.
    We will from now on assume that [2]q 6= 0 over k. Then the Temperley-Lieb
algebras Tn = Tn (q) are quasihereditary. In fact [19, 24], setting ǫ = [2]1q Un−1 , we
have that ǫ is part of a heredity chain for Tn , and since ǫ and Tn−2 ⊂ Tn commute,
Tn ǫ is a right Tn−2 –module, and indeed

                                 ǫTn ǫ = ǫTn−2 ∼
                                               = Tn−2                              (11)

    Let F be the localization functor

                        F : Tn -mod → Tn−2 -mod : M 7→ ǫM

and let G be the globalization functor

                   G : Tn−2 -mod → Tn -mod : N 7→ Tn ǫ ⊗Tn−2 N

Note that F is exact and G is right exact, being the left adjoint of F .


3.1    Homological considerations
Since the categories Tn –mod are quasihereditary they come with standard modules
∆n (λ), costandards ∇n (λ), simples Ln (λ), their projective covers Pn (λ), injective
envelopes In (λ) and tiltings Tn (λ) for λ ∈ Λn = {n, n − 2, . . . , 0/1}. (The heredity
order ⊲ is the reverse of the natural order on Λn as a subset of Z.) The following
statements can be found in appendix A1 of Donkin’s book [10] (in a much more
general setting than ours):

Proposition 2 Assume that λ ∈ Λn−2 . Then
i) F Ln (λ) = Ln−2 (λ).
ii) F ∆n (λ) = ∆n−2 (λ) and F ∇n (λ) = ∇n−2 (λ).
iii) F Pn (λ) = Pn−2 (λ) and F In (λ) = In−2 (λ).
Otherwise (i.e. for λ = n) we have that F Ln (λ) = F ∆n (λ) = F ∇n (λ) = 0.

   Our next step is to investigate the application of G to these modules. Write
M ∈ Fn (∆) if M ∈ Tn –mod has a standard filtration. Write (M : ∆n (µ)) for the
multiplicity of ∆n (µ) as a filtration factor of M. We need the following Proposition:

Proposition 3 If M ∈ Fn−2 (∆) , then GM also has a standard filtration. Further-
more the standard multiplicity is

                                    0              otherwise




                                           5
Proof: By Donkin’s homological criterion, see e.g. [10, A2.2 (iii)], we know that
GM ∈ Fn (∆) if and only if

                            Ext1Tn (GM, ∇n (µ)) = 0 ∀µ ∈ Λn

Applying HomTn (GM, −) to the short exact sequence ∇n (µ) ֒→ In (µ) ։ Qn (µ)
(defining Qn (µ)) yields a long exact sequence whose first terms are

   0 → HomTn (GM, ∇n (µ)) → HomTn (GM, In (µ)) →                 HomTn (GM, Qn (µ))
     → Ext1Tn (GM, ∇n (µ)) → 0

Assume first that µ ∈ Λn−2 . Then by Proposition 2 and adjointness, the first three
terms of this sequence become

  0 → HomTn−2 (M, ∇n−2 (µ)) → HomTn−2 (M, In−2 (µ)) → HomTn−2 (M, F Qn (µ))
                                                                                     (12)
which coincides with the beginning of the long exact sequence that arises from apply-
ing HomTn−2 (M, −) to F ∇n (µ) ֒→ F In (µ) ։ F Qn (µ). But then by (the easy direc-
tion of) the criterion, the last map of (12) is surjective and thus Ext1Tn (GM, ∇n (µ)) =
0 as claimed.
    Assume then that µ = n. When we apply F to the short exact sequence
∇n (n) ֒→ In (n) ։ Qn (n) we get an isomorphism F In (n) ∼        = F Qn (n). So apply-
ing HomTn (GM, −) to it, we get

     0 → HomTn (GM, ∇n (n)) → HomTn (GM, In (n)) → HomTn (GM, Qn (n))

where by adjointness the last map is an isomorphism, so also in this case Ext1Tn (GM, ∇n (µ)) =
0, and the criterion applies.
    To get the multiplicity statement, recall that since M ∈ Fn−2 (∆), GM ∈ Fn (∆),
we have

      (GM : ∆n (µ)) = dim HomTn (GM, ∇n (µ)) = dim HomTn−2 (M, F ∇n (µ))

which is zero for µ = n, while for µ ∈ Λn−2

                    dim HomTn−2 (M, ∇n−2 (µ)) = (M : ∆n−2 (µ))

and we are done. ✷

Remark 1 G does not map Fn−2 (∇) to Fn (∇).

   We may now, incidentally, prove:

Corollary 3.1                           
                        i                   ∆n (λ)   if i = 0
                      L G∆n−2 (λ) =                                                 (13)
                                            0        otherwise
   Proof: The i = 0 case follows from Proposition 3. By applying G to the short
exact sequence Kn−2 (λ) ֒→ Pn−2 (λ) ։ ∆n−2 (λ), the last terms of the resulting long
exact cohomology sequence are as follows:

               L1 G∆n−2 (λ) ֒→ GKn−2 (λ) → GPn−2 (λ) ։ G∆n−2 (λ)


                                            6
Now Kn−2 (λ) has a standard filtration, so once again using Proposition 3 we get
[GPn−2 (λ)] = [G∆n−2 (λ)] + [GKn−2 (λ)], where as usual [M] denotes the image of
M ∈ Tn -mod in the Grothendieck group. But then [L1 G∆n−2 (λ)] = 0 and thus
L1 G∆n−2 (λ) = 0.
    To get the vanishing of the higher Li G∆n−2 (λ), we use induction from above
(with respect to the heredity order) on λ. If λ is maximal (λ = 0 or 1) then
Pn (λ) = ∆n (λ) and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise note that by the long
exact sequence, Li GKn−2 (λ) = Li+1 G∆n−2 (λ) for i > 0 so it is enough to show that
Li GKn−2 (λ) = 0 for these i. But only ∆(µ) with µ⊲λ occur in the standard filtration
of Kn−2 so the induction hypothesis applies to them. Let ν be such that Kn−2 ։
                                              ν                                 ν
∆(ν). Considering the short exact sequence Kn−2   ֒→ Kn−2 ։ ∆(ν) (defining Kn−2     ),
             i     ′       i
we get that L GKn−2 = L GKn−2 and so on. ✷


3.2     The main induction
Recall that the set seqrn {1, 2} is a basis of a permutation submodule of V ⊗n , which
we now denote Mn (2r − n) (the argument 2r − n counts the excess of 1’s over 2’s).
Now let
                     v(r, n) := 111 . . . 11222 . . . 22 ∈ seqrn {1, 2}
Then v(r, n) generates Mn (2r − n) as a Tn –module.
   Our argument for showing that V ⊗n is tilting will be an induction on n. The
inductive step is based on the following Lemma:

Lemma 1 Assume that n ≥ 2. Then there are isomorphisms in Tn−2 –mod:

                                     F (V ⊗n ) ∼
                                               = V ⊗n−2                                       (14)
                                         
                                           Mn−2 (s) |s| < n
                             F Mn (s) ∼
                                      =                                                       (15)
                                           0          |s| = n

Proof: F is multiplication by ǫ = [2]1 q Un−1 , which acts in the last two factors of V ⊗n
through the matrix:                                    
                                          0 0 0 0
                                1   0 q 1−1 0 
                                                        
                               [2]q      0 1 q      0 
                                          0 0 0 0
which has eigenvalues 1 with multiplicity 1 and 0 with multiplicity 3 and therefore
is a projection onto a one dimensional space. Let w2 ∈ V ⊗2 be an eigenvector to
eigenvalue 1 (say w2 = q v1 ⊗ v2 + v2 ⊗ v1 ). Then, cf. proposition 1, the (inverse of
the) first isomorphism is given by vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vin−2 7→ vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vin−2 ⊗ w2 .
    To get the second isomorphism, note first that the above map clearly induces

                                    F Mn (s) ⊆ Mn−2 (s)
                                                                                     L
But then equality follows from the first isomorphism combined with V ⊗n =                s   Mn (s)
and the analogous formula for V ⊗n−2 . ✷
   Note that this Lemma relates level n to n − 2. Accordingly our inductive ar-
gument for proving that V ⊗n is tilting will require two base cases: n = 1 and


                                               7
n = 2. Both are straightforward (n = 1 it trivial, and for n = 2 we have
V ⊗2 = 3∆2 (2) ⊕ ∆2 (0) = 3∇2 (2) ⊕ ∇2 (0) by the proof of the Lemma).
   We now consider the exact sequence
                                                  ϕn
                     0 → Kn → G ◦ F (V ⊗n ) → V ⊗n → Cn → 0                       (16)

where ϕn is the adjointness map.
Proposition 4 Assume that ϕn is injective for all n. Then V ⊗n and Mn (r) are
tilting modules for Tn for all n, r.
Proof. Since F ◦ G = Id, we have that F ◦ G ◦ F = F and hence F (Cn ) = 0. Thus,
cf. Proposition 2, Cn has only (copies of) the ‘trivial’ one dimensional module (=
∆n (n)) as composition factors. But then Cn is semisimple by quasiheredity (or
otherwise).
    Now work by induction on n. By the Lemma and the inductive hypothesis
F (V ⊗n ) is tilting, so in particular F (V ⊗n ) has a standard filtration, and then so
does G ◦ F (V ⊗n ) by Proposition 3. But ϕn is assumed to be injective, so Kn = 0
and (16) becomes a short exact sequence with V ⊗n in the middle and with extremal
terms in Fn (∆). But then V ⊗n too lies in Fn (∆). Since the matrices representing
the action of Tn on V ⊗n are selfadjoint with respect to the canonical, non–degenerate
form (note from the presentation that the algebra is isomorphic to its opposite), V ⊗n
is contravariant selfdual and so tilting. But then also Mn (r) is tilting as a direct
summand of V ⊗n ✷
   We have that ϕn injective implies V ⊗n tilting. As an aside we note that the
reverse implication also holds, and rather more generally. Indeed for M ∈ F (∆),
the adjointness map G ◦ F (M) → M is injective. This is clear if M ∼       = ∆ and
otherwise it follows by induction on the number of ∆-factors in M using the following
commutative diagram
                     0     →     0     →     0
                     ↓           ↓           ↓
             0 → G ◦ F (C) → G ◦ F (M) → G ◦ F (∆) →                        0
                     ↓           ↓           ↓
             0 →     C     →     M     →     ∆     →                        0
where standard ∆ is such that M ։ ∆, noting that the second row of the diagram
is exact because of equation (13).
   Now spelling out the definitions, ϕn is the multiplication map

                     ϕn : Tn Un−1 ⊗Un−1 Tn Un−1 Un−1 V ⊗n → V ⊗n

   The rest of the construction of our inductive step amounts to a careful combi-
natorial analysis of this map. First of all consider Tn Un−1 as a right module over
Un−1 Tn Un−1 . As such it is easy to see that it is generated by the elements

                   Un−1 ,       Un−2 Un−1 ,   ...,     U1 · · · Un−2 Un−1         (17)

But then any element of Tn Un−1 ⊗Un−1 Tn Un−1 Un−1 V ⊗n can be represented in the
form                 X
                         Uk · · · Un−2 Un−1 ⊗Un−1 Tn Un−1 vk                 (18)
                            k


                                              8
for some vk ∈ Un−1 V ⊗n . We must show that this expression is zero if its image
under the multiplication map is zero, i.e. if
                           X
                               Uk · · · Un−2 Un−1 vk = 0
                                   k

To do this, the following notation will be useful:
Recall that i1 i2 . . . in ∈ seqn {1, 2} is a basis element of V ⊗n . Denote by i1 i2 . . . ik−1 12 ik+2 . . . in
the vector Uk (i1 i2 . . . ik−1 12 ik+2 . . . in ). In other words:

i1 i2 . . . ik−1 12 ik+2 . . . in = q vi1 ⊗vi2 ⊗. . .⊗v1 ⊗v2 ⊗. . .⊗vin +vi1 ⊗vi2 ⊗. . .⊗v2 ⊗v1 ⊗. . .⊗vin

    To establish usage of this notation we first work out a couple of low rank exam-
ples.
Example 1. Consider n = 3. Then {U1 , U2 } generate Tn and V ⊗n has dimension
8 and is the direct sum of 4 permutation modules. The injectivity of our map can
be checked on each of them. On the one dimensional permutation modules the
statement is trivial since G ◦ F kills them. Let us then consider the permutation
module generated by 112 (that generated by 122 is isomorphic to it). Applying
G ◦ F , we get by (18) the two vectors

U2 ⊗U2 T3 U2 112 = 1⊗U2 T3 U2 U2 112 = 1⊗U2 T3 U2 112,        U1 U2 ⊗U2 T3 U2 112 = U1 ⊗U2 T3 U2 112

(NB, U2 ⊗ 211 = 0 and U2 ⊗ 121 ∝ U2 ⊗ 112). The images under the multiplication
are
                                 112, 12 1,
and these are linearly independent, so also in this case the statement is clear.
Example 2: Consider n = 4. Then Tn is generated by {U1 , U2 , U3 } and V ⊗n is the
sum of five permutation modules.
   Let us consider the permutation module M4 (0) generated by 1122 ∈ V ⊗4 . Using
(18), G ◦ F M4 (0) is spanned by the vectors

                                  1 ⊗ 1212,     1 ⊗ 2112,
                                  U2 ⊗ 1212,    U2 ⊗ 2112,
                                  U1 U2 ⊗ 1212, U1 U2 ⊗ 2112

i.e. by the set {U1 U2 ⊗ w12, U2 ⊗ w12, 1 ⊗ w12 | w ∈ seq12 {1, 2}}.
     The images under the multiplication map are the vectors

                                           1212, 2112,
                                           1122, 2121,
                                           1212, 1221.

Note that these vectors are not independent, since

                            q1212 + 2112 = 12 12 = q1212 + 1221

On the other hand this ‘trivial’ dependency is the only one,
                                                         as  can seen by a dimen-
                                                           4
sion counting: our permutation module has dimension            = 6 and is generated
                                                           2

                                                  9
by the above vectors together with 1122. So there is exactly one relation between
them, the one we have pointed out.
   Since there is a corresponding dependency amongst the first set of vectors:

  q1 ⊗ 1212 + 1 ⊗ 2112 = 1 ⊗ 1212 = U1 U2 ⊗ 1212 = qU1 U2 ⊗ 1212 + U1 U2 ⊗ 2112

our claim is proved in this case as well.
     We now turn to the general case.
Theorem 1 V ⊗n and Mn (r) are tilting modules for all n.
Proof. By proposition 4 it is enough to show that ϕn is injective for all n. F and G
are additive functors, so the claim can be verified on the permutation submodules.
By (18), G ◦ F on Mn (2r − n) is spanned by
                                                                      r−1
       { X ⊗ w12 | X ∈ {U1 ..Un−1 , U2 ..Un−1 , .., Un−1 , 1}; w ∈ seqn−2 {1, 2}}

     Let us denote by Snr the set of vectors of the form

                                i1 i2 i3 . . . 12 . . . in−2 in−1 in         ik ∈ {1, 2}

inside Mn (2r−n). Note that these are the images of the above vectors
                                                                       under
                                                                           the mul-
                                                                   n−1         n−2
tiplication map. A simple counting argument shows that |Snr | =                        .
                                                                      1        r−1
Note that Mn (2r − n) is spanned by Snr ∪ {v(r, n)}. But Snr is not linearly indepen-
dent. To each vector in Mn (2r − n) of the form

                                      i1 i2 i3 . . . 12 . . . 12 . . . in−2 in−1 in

we may associate a dependency:

q . . . 12 . . . 12 . . .+. . . 21 . . . 12 . . . = . . . 12 . . . 12 . . . = q . . . 12 . . . 12 . . .+. . . 12 . . . 21 . . .
                                                                                                                       (19)
Note that each of these dependencies has a preimage in G ◦ F Mn (2r − n):

         qUj ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . 12 . . . wj wj+1 . . . 12 + Uj ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . 21 . . . wj wj+1 . . . 12

                                    = Uj ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . 12 . . . wj wj+1 . . . 12
                                    = Ui ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . wi wi+1 . . . 12 . . . 12
        = qUi ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . wi wi+1 . . . 12 . . . 12 + Ui ..Un−2 ⊗ . . . wi wi+1 . . . 21 . . . 12
(recall that we are tensoring over ǫTn ǫ = Un−1 Tn Un−1 ).
    Let Sn′ denote the subset of Snr in which no subsequence 12 appears before the
12. We will now show, using the set of linear dependencies above, that all vectors
not in the subset Sn′ may be discarded without affecting the spanning property, i.e.
Mn (2r − n) is also spanned by Sn′ ∪ {v(r, n)}.
    Let the ‘underlying’ sequence u(s) ∈ seqn {1, 2} of s ∈ Snr be the sequence ob-
tained by removing the underline from s. Note that any s ∈ Snr of the form ..12..12..
can be written as a linear combination of ..12..12.. and ..21..12.. and ..12..21.. using
(19), and that the last two have underlying sequences later in the lexicographic order
than ..12..12... Let s = ..12..12.. ∈ Snr \ Sn′ . There may be other pairs 12 before 12
in s, but we may take it that the pair 12 written explicitly is the first such. Using

                                                             10
the above remark we then replace s by a linear combination of an element of Sn′
and elements of Snr not necessarily in Sn′ but whose underlying sequence is later in
the lexicographic order than u(s). Iterating, we arrive at 22.211211..1 (or similar)
which is in Sn′ .
    Note that Sn′ has a natural bijection with seqrn {1, 2} \ {22..211..1} (every element
of this set has at least one subsequence 12 — just underline the first of these). Thus
Sn′ ∪ {v(r, n)} is a basis of Mn (2r − n), and in particular it is linearly independent.
This means that all linear dependencies in Sn can be constructed from those of form
(19). But each of these dependencies has a preimage in G ◦ F Mn (2r − n), so ϕn has
a trivial kernel. ✷
Corollary 1.1 V ⊗n is a full tilting module for Tn .
Proof. We proved in the Theorem that Mn (s) is a tilting module for all n, s. Now
we have the restriction rule
  ResTTnn−1 Mn (s) = Mn−1 (s − 1) ⊕ Mn−1 (s + 1) for s ∈ {−n, −n + 2 . . . , n − 2, n}
Combining this with the restriction rule for the standard modules [19]
     [Resnn−1 ∆n (s)] = [∆n−1 (s + 1)] + [∆n−1 (s − 1)] for s ∈ {0/1 . . . , n − 2, n}
it is easily proved by induction that
                    [Mn (s)] = [∆n (s)] + [∆n (s + 2)] + . . . (s ≥ 0)
In other words (Mn (s) : ∆n (u)) = 1 for u less than or equal s in the heredity order;
0 otherwise. But then the tilting module Tn (s) must occur as a summand of Mn (s)
(with multiplicity one). ✷


4     The blob crypto–tensor module case
Let us now consider the blob algebra situation. Our overall strategy will be similar
to the one used in the previous section. In particular the quasiheredity arguments
carry over almost unchanged. On the other hand, the actual calculation requires
some new combinatorial ideas.
    We keep the condition that [2]q 6= 0, but assume also that [m]q 6= 0 (where m is
as in section 1.1). In that case the blob algebra bkn = bn is quasihereditary, see [24].
In fact, setting ǫ = [2]1 q Un−1 , we have as for Tn (q) that ǫ is part of a heredity chain
for bn and ǫbn ǫ ∼
                 = bn−2 . Accordingly the results from the previous section involving
quasiheredity hold in this case as well. We state them here indicating the necessary
modifications of the previous proofs.
    As before we have a localization functor F
                        F : bn –mod → bn−2 –mod : M 7→ ǫM
and a globalization functor G
                    G : bn−2 –mod → bn –mod : N 7→ bn ǫ ⊗bn−2 N
    We denote as before the standard (costandard etc.) modules in bn -mod by ∆n (λ)
(∇n (λ) etc.), but in this case the parametrizing set is Γn = {−n, −n+2, . . . , n−2, n}
[22, 24]. We then have the following version of Proposition 2

                                            11
Proposition 5 Assume that λ ∈ Γn−2 . Then
i) F Ln (λ) = Ln−2 (λ).
ii) F ∆n (λ) = ∆n−2 (λ) and F ∇n (λ) = ∇n−2 (λ).
iii) F Pn (λ) = Pn−2 (λ) and F In (λ) = In−2 (λ).
Otherwise ( i.e. for λ = n or λ = −n ) we have F Ln (λ) = F ∆n (λ) = F ∇(λ) = 0.

We then get as before

Proposition 6 Supposing a module M ∈ Fn−2 (∆) (i.e. M ∈ bn−2 -mod has a
standard filtration), then G(M) also has a standard filtration. Furthermore
                                    
                                      (M : ∆n−2 (µ)) if µ ∈ Γn−2
                  (G(M) : ∆n (µ)) =
                                      0                otherwise

Proof. The proof is once again an application of the cohomological criterion for
standard filtrations. One shows that Ext1Tn (G(M), ∇n (µ)) = 0 for all µ. The
special case µ = n from the Temperley-Lieb situation now becomes two special
cases µ = n and µ = −n, each of which can be treated as before. ✷
   The cohomological statement (13) also carries over:

Corollary 6.1                          
                        i                  ∆n (λ)    if i = 0
                      L G∆n−2 (λ) =                                              (20)
                                           0         otherwise

   The set seqr2n {1, 2} is a basis of a permutation module of ρ which we denote
Mn (2r − 2n). (For example a basis of M2 (0) is {1122, 1212, 1221, 2112, 2121, 2211}.)
Evidently
                 b
              Resbnn+1 Mn+1 (λ) = Mn (λ + 2) ⊕ 2Mn (λ) ⊕ Mn (λ − 2)              (21)

We also have a blob algebra version of (14):

Lemma 2 Assume that n ≥ 2. Then there are isomorphisms in bn−2 –mod:

                                F (V ⊗2n ) ∼
                                           = V ⊗2(n−2)                           (22)
                                
                              ∼    Mn−2 (s) |s| < 2n − 2
                     F Mn (s) =                                                  (23)
                                   0          |s| = 2n, 2n − 2
Proof. The Temperley–Lieb argument goes through almost unchanged: F is mul-
tiplication by the idempotent ǫ = [2]1q Un−1 which acts only in the first two and
last two factors of V ⊗2n . The isomorphism V ⊗2(n−2) → F (V ⊗2n ) is given by w ∈
V ⊗2(n−2) 7→ ev1 ⊗ w ⊗ ev2 where ev1 ⊗ ev2 ∈ V ⊗4 is an eigenvector to eigenvalue 1
of our idempotent ǫ. ✷
We consider also in the blob algebra setting the adjointness map ϕn : G◦F (V ⊗2n ) →
V ⊗2n and get a four term exact sequence:
                                                ϕn
                     0 → Kn → G ◦ F (V ⊗2n ) → V ⊗2n → Cn → 0                    (24)

Proposition 7 Assume that ϕn is injective for all n. Then V ⊗2n and Mn (r) are
tilting modules for bn for all n, r.


                                           12
Proof. The Temperley–Lieb proof carries over almost verbatim. ✷
   We are then once again left with the task of showing injectivity of the adjointness
map ϕn : G ◦ F (V ⊗2n ) → V ⊗2n . Let us as before first work out a low rank example
(which will this time also be needed in the general argument).
Example 1. Consider n = 2. Then the blob algebra b2 acts on V ⊗4 as described in
section 2. For example

              U1 1212 = st1212 + s1221 + t2112 + 2121             =: 12 12

(NB, the underline notation is refined here to accommodate the definition of ρ —
the position of the underline to left or right of centre determines precisely which
linear combination it corresponds to). A generating set of b2 is U1 and U0 = a2 e.
Hence the vectors
                               1 ⊗ 12 12, U0 ⊗ 12 12
generate G ◦ F (V ⊗4 ). The images under the multiplication map ϕ2 are

                                    12 12,        1122
                                                  |{z}
(where 1122 denotes a certain linear combination of 1122 and 2121: U0 12 12 =
       |{z}
r2121 + 2211 + rst1122 + st1212) which are independent.
   More generally, a spanning set for G ◦ F (V ⊗2n ) is given by

The images under the multiplication map are vectors of the form ..12..12.. where
the concatenation of the subsequences indicated by ellipsis is the sequence w from
seq2n−4 {1, 2}, and the first and second 12 are equidistant from the left and right
hand end respectively; and .. 1122 .., where the concatenation of the subsequences
                                |{z}
indicated by ellipsis is the sequence from seq2n−4 {1, 2}. This is a consequence of the
following straightforward exercise in the blob algebra relations:
Lemma 3 Let ǫ = [2]1q Un−1 . The set {1, Un−2 , Un−2 Un−3 , . . . , Un−2 Un−3 . . . U0 }
generates bn ǫ as a right ǫbn ǫ–module.
    It will be evident that linear dependencies arise in general between these vectors,
in a way analogous to the Tn case. For example it is easy to write down a linear
dependence involving 12121212 and 12121212 (and others).
    It is straightforward, using this machinery, to verify that ϕn is injective and
hence our module is tilting, up to b4 and a little beyond. We will prove injectivity
for general n by a slightly different route.
    Define first numbers v(n) by the recursion v(0) = 1, v(1) = 1, v(−1) = 3 and

v(n) = 4v(n − 1) − v(n − 2)     if n ≥ 2,         v(n) = 4v(n + 1) − v(n + 2)   if n ≤ −2



                                             13
Proposition 8 Let ρ(n) be the representation ρ of bn on V ⊗2n . Then
1) ϕn : G ◦ F (ρ(n)) → ρ(n) is injective, so ρ(n) is a tilting module.
2) (ρ(n) : ∆n (λ)) = v(λ).
3) Set rn = dim(G ◦ F (ρ(n))). Then r1 = 0, r2 = 2, and

                              rn = 4rn−1 + 4n−2 − rn−2 .

Proof: By induction on n. The case n = 1 follows easily from the fact that

                          ρ(1) = V ⊗ V ∼
                                       = ∆1 (1) ⊕ 3∆1 (−1)

and 1) and 3) of the n = 2 case is the calculation done above. The calculation also
shows that dim F (ρ(2)) = 1, so we get that ∆2 (0) occurs in ρ(2) with multiplicity
1. We can then read off the other two multiplicities using Resbb21 ρ(2) = 4ρ(1) and
the restriction rules for the standard modules, thus verifying 2). For the reader’s
convenience we express this last point in formulas: write ρ(2) in the Grothendieck
group as follows
                      ρ(2) = a2 ∆2 (2) + a0 ∆2 (0) + a−2 ∆2 (−2)
Applying F to this expression we get a0 = 1 and applying the restriction functor to
it we get
            4 ρ(1) = Resρ(2) = (a2 + a0 ) ∆1 (1) + (a−2 + a0 ) ∆1 (−1)
and 2) now follows from ρ(1) = ∆1 (1) + 3 ∆1 (−1).
     Now assume the Proposition for n′ with n′ < n. Then F (ρ(n)) = ρ(n − 2) is
tilting and

       (F (ρ(n)) : ∆n−2 (λ)) = (ρ(n − 2) : ∆n−2 (λ)) = v(λ) if |λ| ≤ n − 2

But then also
                     (G ◦ F (ρ(n)) : ∆n (λ)) = v(λ) if |λ| ≤ n − 2
since G is exact on F (∆) and takes standard modules to standard modules. Note
[24] the short exact sequence
                                                                        ⊳
     0 → ∆n−1 (λ ± 1) → Resbbnn−1 ∆n (λ) → ∆n−1 (λ ∓ 1) → 0      (λ ∓ 1 ⊲ λ)     (25)

(∆n−1 (ν) to be interpreted as 0 if |ν| > n − 1). We can then calculate rn as follows
           X                        X
   rn =           v(λ)|∆n (λ)| =          v(λ) ( |∆n−1 (λ + 1)| + |∆n−1 (λ − 1)| ) =
         λ:|λ|≤n−2               λ:|λ|≤n−2


(v(n − 2) + v(n − 4)) |∆n−1 (n − 3)| + . . . + (v(−n + 2) + v(−n + 4)) |∆n−1 (−n + 3)|
                +v(n − 2)|∆n−1 (n − 1)| + v(−n + 2)|∆n−1(−n + 1)|
Using the recursion formula for v(n), this becomes

4 {v(n − 3)|∆n−1 (n − 3)| + . . . + v(−n + 3)|∆n−1(−n + 3)|} + v(n − 2) + v(−n + 2)

   We now apply the induction hypothesis (part 2) and 3)) and get that the first
term is equal to 4rn−1 , while the sum v(n − 2) + v(−n + 2) is equal to

                     dim ρ(n − 2)/G ◦ F (ρ(n − 2)) = 4n−2 − rn−2

                                             14
Combining this we have shown 3) at level n.
   To prove 2) at level n note first that F annihilates ρ(n)/G ◦ F (ρ(n)), so it can
be written in the Grothendieck group as a sum

                                an ∆n (n) + a−n ∆n (−n)

We restrict and apply the formula Res ρ(n) = 4 ρ(n − 1), and find by comparing
coefficients that

        an + v(n − 2) = 4 v(n − 1)       and     a−n + v(−n + 2) = 4 v(−n + 1)

Since the ∆–multiplicities of G◦F (ρ(n)) are already known by induction, this shows
2) at level n.
    Let us now finally prove 1) at level n. This is the most tricky part of our proof
and involves some interesting combinatorics on sequences. Let v ∈ ϕn (Bn ), then the
four sequences which occur as summands of v are either of the form

                      {x12y12z, x12y21z, x21y12z, x21y21z}

where x, y, z ∈ seq{1, 2}, or

                         {x1122z, x1212z, x2121z, x2211z}

where x, z ∈ seq{1, 2}. Define u(v) ∈ seq2n {1, 2} to be the lexicographically earliest
sequence that occurs as a summand of v.
   One easily sees from the description of the elements of ϕn (Bn ) that u(v) satisfies
the rule
                                  au(v)b = u(avb)                                 (26)
for a, b ∈ {1, 2} such that avb ∈ ϕn (Bn+1 ).
    Now define for all n ≥ 1 a subset En of our representation space V ⊗2n as follows:

                           E1 := ∅,       E2 := {1212, 1122}
                                                       |{z}
then for n ≥ 2 :
                        En1 := { 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2 | x ∈ En−1 }
                    En2 := { 12w12 | w ∈ seq2n−4 {1, 2} \ u(En−2 ) }
                                      En := En1 ∪ En2
Consider now the following properties of En :
Claim: i) |En | = rn
ii) En is a basis of ϕn (G ◦ F (ρ(n)))
iii) |En | = |u(En )|
iv) u(En1 ) ∩ u(En2 ) = ∅
    Part 1) of the Proposition is a consequence of i) and ii) since we already know that
dim G ◦ F (ρ(n)) = rn . In order to prove the claim we again proceed by induction.
Since Eni are only defined for n ≥ 3 we take n = 3 as base of the induction, but
actually i), ii) and iii) also make sense for n = 1, 2 and basically follow from the
calculations prior to the Proposition: note that

                         u(12 12) = 1212,        u(1122) = 1122
                                                   |{z}

                                            15
to obtain iii). Now for n = 3 we have

Each element of E31 has summands all of which have the same first and last factor,
and therefore cannot appear in E32 . Since there are clearly no duplicates inside the
two sets, we get then i). Applying u to the two sets produces the same two sets, with
the underlines removed, so also iii) and iv) follow. But then also ii) follows: u picks
out the highest summand of the elements, so the matrix relating the vectors of E3
and those of u(E3 ) is lower triangular with respect to our order. Note furthermore
that E3 clearly is a subset of ϕn (Bn ) by the description of this before the Proposition.
   The proof of the induction step n − 1 ⇒ n goes as follows. First of all i) is clear
from the definitions. From iii) at level n − 1 we get that

                           |En1 | = |u(En1 )| and |En2 | = |u(En2 )|

But then we get iv) ⇒ iii) ⇒ ii) at level n: the first implication since

                 |En | = |En1 ∪ En2 | = |En1 | + |En2 | = |u(En1 )| + |u(En2 )| =

                        |u(En1 ) ∪ u(En2 )| = |u(En1 ∪ En2 )| = |u(En )|
The second implication, since once again u defines a lower triangular matrix with
respect to the order and since En ⊂ ϕn (Bn ) by the description of ϕn (Bn ). So let us
prove iv). Now

          u(En1 ) ∩ u(En2 ) = u(En1 ) ∩ {12w12 | w ∈ seq2n−4 {1, 2} \ u(En−2 )}

Consider first
                           u(En1 ) ∩ {12w12 | w ∈ seq2n−4 {1, 2}}
Any element of this intersection is on the form 1t2 = u(e) where e ∈ En1 . But
applying u and the rule (26) to the different elements of En1 we see that e = 1x2
with x ∈ En−1 . Now u(e) is also on the form 12w12, so x = 2y1. But such an x
                    1
must come from En−1     and thus y ∈ En−2 . All in all: u(e) = 12y12 with y ∈ En−2 .
But then our first intersection is empty proving the last part of the claim.

4.1     Fullness and more multiplicities
The standard content of the individual ρ–permutation modules Mn (λ) may be de-
termined similarly to that of ρ, except that we need to recurse all the λs together.


                                               16
   By Lemma 2 there is a function v λ (µ) such that

                               v λ (µ) = (Mn (λ) : ∆n (µ))

for any n.
    By virtue of (21) and (25) we have

               v λ−2 (µ) + 2v λ (µ) + v λ+2 (µ) = v λ (µ + 1) + v λ (µ − 1)        (27)

As before, explicit inspection of the smallest cases is sufficient to prime a recursion
using this formula to determine all multiplicities. We have for example

                                                 λ=

                                          y

we have a + 2b + c = x + y.
    Note that M(λ) ∼  = M(−λ) and that such a λ is necessarily even. Accordingly,
call {2n, 2n − 2, 2n − 4, .., 0} the set of M–weights of bn — a sufficient set of labels
for inequivalent permutation modules.
    We do not need a closed formula for all the multiplicities, but rather

                                   0        0 < 2µ < (λ + 2)

Proof: This is the neighbourhood of the domain of zeros (unwritten) in our table
above. The template (28) populates this region as claimed with the rows at µ = 0, ±1
as base. ✷
(Another proof follows from noting, for example, that Mn (2n) = ∆n (−n) so (Mn (λ) :
∆n (µ)) = 0 if 0 > 2µ > −λ and (Mn (λ) : ∆n (µ)) = 1 if 2µ = −λ.)

Corollary 9.1 The module ρ is full tilting.

                                            17
Proof: The singleton multiplicities in the expression above give a bijection between
the M–weights and ordinary weights. Recall [10] that each T(µ) contains:
    • one copy of ∆µ , and

    • no copy of any other standard module except having weight higher in the
      heredity order.
The proposition thus implies that M(λ) contains no T(µ) unless µ lower than (or
equal to) the ordinary weight corresponding to λ; and hence exactly one copy of the
indecomposable tilting module associated to the corresponding ordinary weight. ✷


5     On the generic standard content of ρ′
The question of tilting for ρ′ remains open (our specific combinatorial constuction
in the proof of injectivity of ϕn is particular to ρ). For the reasons outlined in [23]
it might be useful to know the standard content of ρ′ when it is tilting. Just as for
ρ we have

                                    F (ρ′ (n + 2)) ∼
                                                   = ρ′ (n)                                     (29)
                                          ′           ′
                                   Resn+2
                                      n ρ (n + 2) = 4ρ (n)

The argument for (29) in the ρ′ case is exactly the same as before.
   Under the assumption that ρ′ has a standard filtration (as in any semisimple
specialisation for example), it follows from Proposition 5 and (29) that there is a
function v ′ : Z → N such that

                                     (ρ′ (n) : ∆(λ)) = v ′ (λ)

(any n, |λ| ≤ n, λ − n ≡ 0 mod.2). Let M(i, j) : Z → N be M(i, j) = δi,j−1 + δi,j+1,
so (from [24])

                           (Resn+1
                               n ∆n+1 (µ) : ∆n (λ)) = M(λ, µ)                                   (30)

Regarding M, v ′ as infinite matrices it follows that

                                            Mv ′ = 4v ′

which is to say that
                                v ′ (λ + 1) + v ′ (λ − 1) = 4v ′ (λ)
Thus v ′ is determined by recursion from the initial conditions

                            v ′ (0) = 1,    v ′ (1) = 2,    v ′ (−1) = 2

(which may be determined by inspection of the representations themselves — note
that it is only these initial conditions which distinguish this analysis from a cor-
responding one for ρ). In case l > 0 we may now obtain v ′ (l + 1) by v ′ (l + 1) =
4v ′ (l) − v ′ (−l + 1) = 4v ′(l) − v ′ (l − 1) (l < 0 case similar, or note that v ′ (−l) = v ′ (l)).

6     Discussion
In [23] the representations ρ and ρ′ were introduced, and Martin and Woodcock
posed the question of whether these representations are full tilting. We have now
answered this question in the affirmative for ρ. (They also asked if the represen-
tations are faithful for arbitrary k — a question we answer in the affirmative in
[20], using entirely different techniques.) The primary focus of the original paper,
however, was generalisations of the blob algebra. In particular it points out the
potential usefulness of corresponding generalisations of ρ. It does not succeed in
constructing any. The discovery in the present paper that ρ is tilting makes it even
more desirable to find such generalisations.
    Since we have constructed a full tilting module for bn we have, formally at least,
constructed a Ringel dual, Bn = Endbn (V ⊗2n ). Armed with this mechanism (and
the associated combinatorics, summarized generically by the truncation

where the nth matrix row gives the dimensions of standards of bn−1 ; and the column
vector gives their multiplicities, and hence the dimensions of (co)standards of the
dual) we can search for Lie theoretic settings (i.e., a familiar presentation) for this
dual.
    This search will be the subject of a separate paper, but it behoves us to assemble
the clues which are now ready to hand. In particular, let us look briefly at the most
interesting case in characteristic 0. This means, essentially, q an lth root of unity
and m an integer (|m| < l). (Although the connection with Lie theory is still,
for the present, ‘virtual’ we know from [24] that Lie theoretic terminology provides
the correct setting for a description of blob representation theory.) Then the alcove
structure is as follows. The weight space is R and integral weights Z. The affine Weyl
group is generated by a reflection at m and another at m − l. No ‘wall’ (reflection
point) lies at 0, so call the alcove containing 0 the 0–alcove. Label the first alcove on
the ±–ve side of the 0–alcove the ±1–alcove. Label all other alcoves by the obvious
counting scheme. The blocks are the affine Weyl orbits, and the regular blocks are
(up to localisation) Morita equivalent, so we will pick one arbitrarily and relabel
weights in it simply by their alcove labels. Then the simple submodule structure of

(the ladder continues down until truncated by localisation). So far all is taken from
[24]. Now consider what we may deduce about the indecomposable tilting module
labelled by ν. We have that every simple in the defining standard must be the socle
of a costandard. We need then to take a standard filtered closure, and assemble the
resultant melange into a contravariant selfdual module. For example:

Here, since layers may contain modules with multiplicity, some of the edges in the
graph indicate no more than layer constraints (although they provide a useful guide
to the eye). These modules are, of course, far from projective.
    Note that although Tn (q) fails to be quasihereditary when [2] = 0 this failure
is degenerate rather than exceptional, in the sense that if one allows the notion
of a single ‘formal’ standard module of dimension 0 then the whole formalism is
resurrected (the fact that V ⊗n itself is not compromised by passing to [2] = 0 is a
signal of this). Similar statements apply in the blob case and, as mentioned above,
in the paper [20] we show that ρ is faithful for arbitrary (not just quasihereditary)
specialisations. The questions of tilting and faithfulness for ρ′ remain open.
