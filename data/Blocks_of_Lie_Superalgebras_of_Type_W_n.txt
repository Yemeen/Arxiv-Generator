                                             0      Introduction

                                             Let g be a simple, finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra over C. These have been classified by V. Kac. Unless

                                             g is a Lie algebra or a Lie superalgebra of type osp(1, 2n), the category of finite-dimensional representations

                                             of g is not semisimple; q.v. [8]. This leads to a classification problem. For example, in [4], the representation

                                             theory of sl(m, n) is worked out by showing it is wild when m, n ≥ 2, and by giving an explicit description

                                             of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of sl(1, n).

                                                  When g is of type W (0, n), the irreducible finite-dimensional g-modules are classified in [1]; in this paper,

                                             we investigate finite-dimensional indecomposable modules. We show that the category of finite-dimensional

                                             representations of g is wild (i.e., as hard as classifying pairs of matrices; q.v. §2) when g is of type W (0, n)

                                             with n ≥ 3. More precisely, the category of finite-dimensional representations decomposes into blocks
                                                                
                                             parametrised by C/Z × Z2 , and we show that each block is of wild type. This is done by explicitly

                                             exhibiting enough extensions between simple modules.

                                                  Secondly, we find the decomposition of the category of finite-dimensional representations into blocks. As

                                             an application, using an idea of Maria Gorelik, we prove that the centre of the universal enveloping algebra

                                             of g is trivial.

                                                  When n = 2, there is a special isomorphism W (0, 2) ∼
                                                                                                      = sl(1, 2), in which case the representation theory is

                                             not wild, and the indecomposable representations are fully described in [4].

    The results in this paper are also related to results of Nakano [7] in the finite-characteristic case, for which

he shows that the restricted universal enveloping algebra has a single block, and determines the structure of

projective modules.




1     Conventions

By g we shall denote a simple, finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra over the complex numbers. Our primary

object of study will be the category of (graded) finite-dimensional g-modules, with even intertwiners.

    The universal enveloping algebra U (g) of g is an associative superalgebra; it satisfies the graded version

of the usual universal property, thus a g-module is the same thing as a left U (g)-module.




2     Quivers and representation type

A quiver is a directed graph, which consists of a set of vertices connected by various arrows (possibly

including multiple arrows between two vertices, loops, etc.) Let A be a unital C-algebra, and denote by M

some category of modules over A. Denote by Irr M the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible objects. The

Ext-quiver of M is defined to be the quiver whose set of vertices is Irr M and where the number of arrows

from [S1 ] to [S2 ] is equal to dim Ext1 (S1 , S2 ). This is a combinatorial invariant of M, whose structure gives

information about the representation type. In particular, we have the following theorem, proven in [3]:


Proposition 2.1. Let A be an algebra, and let Q be a subquiver of the Ext-quiver of A. If Q is a connected

quiver containing no path of length 2, then there exists a fully faithful functor from the category of represen-

tations of Q to the category of A-modules. In particular, the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable

representations of Q embeds into the corresponding set for A.


    The representation theory of quivers is well-established (see [2] for a comprehensive overview). In partic-

ular, if the underlying graph of a quiver is not of Dynkin or of affine type, then the representation theory of

the quiver is wild. More precisely, a small C-linear Abelian category M is defined to be wild if there exists a

full exact embedding from the category of finite-dimensional representations of Chx, yi, the free associative



                                                         2
algebra on two generators, into M. This has the consequence that the objects of M are unclassifiable in

any finite sense. For example, if M is wild, then it is possible to obtain any finite-dimensional algebra as

the endomorphisms of some object.




3       Definition of W (n)

Assume that n ≥ 2. The finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras W (n) := W (0, n) may be described as follows:

       [ξ] = [ξ1 , . . . , ξn ] be the Grassmann algebra on n generators. It is a 2n -dimensional associative Z-
      V     V
let

graded algebra. We set W (n) = Der [ξ]. It is a simple Lie superalgebra of dimension n2n . The Z-grading
                                  V

                        Ln−1
on W (n) is W (n) =        k=−1   Wk .

      The component W0 is canonically isomorphic to gl(n); let us describe the structure of W (n) as a gl(n)-

module. Let std be the standard representation of gl(n); then there is an isomorphism W (n) ∼
                                                                                            = (std)⊗std∗ .
                                                                                              V


If std is regarded as a Z-graded vector space lying in degree 1, then this is an isomorphism of Z-graded vector
                     Vk+1
spaces, so that Wk ∼
                   =      (std) ⊗ std∗ ; note that this has at most two irreducible components.

      There is a bijection between simple finite-dimensional W (n)-modules and simple finite-dimensional gl(n)-

modules, realized as follows: to an irreducible finite-dimensional W (n)-module V , associate the gl(n)-module

V W≥1 , and, conversely, given a simple finite-dimensional gl(n)-module M , take the irreducible quotient of

the induced module U (W (n)) ⊗U(W≥0 ) M (q.v. [1]).

      It is well-known that the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of gl(n), in the ungraded case, are

parametrised by weights λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ), where λi − λj ∈ Z≥0 for i ≤ j. In the super case, this is true up

to parity reversal. We fix, once and for all, the Cartan subalgebra h consisting of diagonal matrices in gl(n);

it is also a Cartan subalgebra of W (n). Weights are written down with respect to the basis {ε1 , . . . , εn }

of h∗ dual to {E11 , . . . , Enn }.




4       Kac modules

The Lie superalgebra W (n) is defined in Section 3. It contains subalgebras gl(n) ⊂ sl(1, n) ⊆ W (n), where

we will fix the identifications gl(n) ∼
                                      = W0 and sl(1, n) ∼
                                                        = W−1 ⊕ W0 ⊕ span{ ξi E | i = 1, . . . , n }, where


                                                         3
      Pn        ∂
E =     i=1 ξi ∂ξi   is the Euler vector field. Sometimes we will omit the parameters and write W for W (n),

sl for sl(1, n), and gl for gl(n). Let g be either W (n) or sl(1, n). We fix the Cartan subalgebra h = h0

consisting of diagonal matrices in gl(n), and consider all weights with respect to h. Weights are written

down with respect to the basis {ε1 , . . . , εn } of h∗ dual to {E11 , . . . , Enn }; we then have h∗ ∼
                                                                                                      = Cn and the

root lattice Q ∼
               = Zn . We fix the Borel subalgebra b0 ⊂ gl(n) of upper-triangular matrices, which has positive

roots { εi − εj | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n }. The corresponding set of highest weights of finite-dimensional irreducible

representations (modulo parity if we consider graded representations) is



                               Λ+ = { (λ1 , . . . , λn ) | ∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n λi − λj ∈ Z≥0 } .



Define the Borel subalgebra b1 of g by b1 = b0 ⊕ g≥1 .

   Let Lλ denote the simple, finite-dimensional gl(n)-module with highest weight λ.

Definition. The Kac module K(λ) = Kλ is the induced representation



                                        Kλ = indgg≥0 Lλ = U (g) ⊗U(g≥0 ) Lλ



of g, where g≥1 acts trivially on Lλ .

   The module K(λ) is finite-dimensional, indecomposable, and has highest weight λ with respect to the

Borel subalgebra b1 of g.

   There is a bijection between simple finite-dimensional g-modules and simple finite-dimensional gl(n)-

modules, realised as follows: to an irreducible finite-dimensional g-module V , associate the gl(n)-module

V g≥1 , and, conversely, given a simple finite-dimensional gl(n)-module M , extend it to g≥0 , then take the

unique irreducible quotient of the induced module U (g) ⊗U(g≥0 ) M . Denote the unique irreducible quotient

of K(λ) by S(λ).

   For g = W (n), the irreducible finite-dimensional representations are determined explicitly in [1]. For a

generic weight λ, the representation Kλ is irreducible.

   For sl(1, n), the situation is similar, and we will need the following facts (see [5]). Consider the sl(1, n)-



                                                           4
modules



                             K sl (λ) = indsl
                                           sl0 ⊕sl1 Lλ ,       K op (λ) = indsl
                                                                             sl−1 ⊕sl0 Lλ .




There is a generic condition called typicality such that



                                    λ is typical ⇐⇒ K sl (λ) is irreducible.



Moreover, λ is typical iff K sl (λ) is projective in the category of finite-dimensional gl(n)-semisimple sl(1, n)-

modules, and the category of finite-dimensional gl-semisimple sl(1, n)-modules with typical subquotients is

semisimple. For typical weights, we have Kλop = K sl (λ + 1 · · · 1). Note that if λ 6∈ Zn , then the weight λ

must be typical.

    Now consider certain W -modules, the big Kac modules



                                K ′ (λ) = indW               W     sl
                                             W−1 ⊕W0 Lλ = indsl indg−1 ⊕g0 Lλ .




We have K ′ (λ) ∼
                = indW
                         op     W   sl                     ′
                     sl Kλ = indsl K (λ + 1 · · · 1). The K (λ) are indecomposable modules with highest


weight λ with respect to b2 = W−1 ⊕ b0 .




5     Extensions

In this section, we show the existence of certain non-split extensions between Kac modules. These will be

realised as quotients of big Kac modules. More precisely, let M be the category of W (n)-modules that are

direct sums of finite-dimensional semisimple gl(n)-modules and are sl(1, n)-locally finite.


Claim. (1) M has enough projectives, i.e., every module in M is a quotient of a projective module in M;

(2) if P is a finite-dimensional projective sl-module, then indW
                                                               sl P is projective in M.



Proof. The main point is that induction takes projectives to projectives. All modules in this proof are

assumed to be direct sums of simple finite-dimensional gl(n)-modules.


                                                           5
   The category of locally finite sl-modules has enough projectives. This may be checked as follows. In

the category of semisimple locally finite gl(n)-modules, every module is projective and injective. Therefore,

if Z is any such gl(n)-module, then indsl
                                       gl (Z) is projective in the category of locally finite sl-modules. In


particular, if M0 is a locally finite sl(1, n)-module, then M0 will be a quotient of the standard projective

indsl
   gl (M0 ), and therefore the category of locally finite sl-modules has enough projectives.


   Finally, if M ∈ Ob M, then there will exist a projective cover P0 → ressl M , therefore we can get M as a

quotient indW             W                                                                   W
            sl (P0 ) → indsl (M ) → M , where the last arrow is the canonical homomorphism indsl (M ) → M ,


which is given by u ⊗ m 7→ um. This proves (1).

   For (2), we first note that, in this case, a locally finite sl-module will in fact be a direct sum of finite-

dimensional sl-modules, and, therefore, if P is projective in the category of finite-dimensional sl-modules, then

P is projective in this slightly larger category. Then induction makes indW
                                                                          sl (P ) a projective W -module.



Because of the claim, since there are enough projectives, any module in M has a projective resolution. If



                                          · · · → P−1 → P0 → M → 0



is a projective resolution of a module M , we can calculate ExtM (M, N ) as the cohomology of the complex



                        HomM (P0 , N ) → HomM (P−1 , N ) → HomM (P−2 , N ) → · · · ,



where the maps are obtained by composing a homomorphism with the appropriate map in the projective

resolution. The following proposition is standard (e.g., see [4]):


Proposition 5.1. If λ 6= µ, then Ext1U(W ) S(λ), S(µ) = Ext1M S(λ), S(µ) .
                                                                       



Proof. Let E be an extension of S(λ) by S(µ), where λ 6= µ; then we need to show that the centre of gl(n)

acts semisimply.

   Let π : W → EndC (E) be the action of W . Let Z be the Euler vector field, and consider π(Z) ∈ EndC (E).

The Jordan-Chevalley decomposition gives π(Z) = X + Y , where X (resp. Y ) is semisimple (resp. nilpotent).

Furthermore, ad(X) and ad(Y ) are respectively semisimple and nilpotent, they commute, the decomposition


                                                       6
is unique, and each of them maps π(W ) into π(W ). Note that ad(Z) is semisimple, hence ad(π(Z)) ∈

End(π(W )) is semisimple. Then ad(Y ) = ad(π(Z)) − ad(X), the difference of two commuting semisimple

endomorphisms, so ad(Y ) also acts semisimply on π(W ), therefore ad(Y ) restricted to π(W ) is zero.

   Therefore we see that the nilpotent part Y of the action of the Euler vector field is a nilpotent W -module

endomorphism of E. Since Y is nilpotent, we have Y |S(µ) = 0 and Y : S(λ) → S(µ). If λ 6= µ, the only

morphism S(λ) → S(µ) is zero.


                  / Zn . Then λ is typical for sl(1, n), and we have K ′ (λ) ∼
   Suppose that λ ∈                                                          = indW
                                                                                      op     W   sl
                                                                                  sl Kλ = indsl K (λ +


1 · · · 1). Such big Kac modules are therefore projective, according to the above claim. Now let M be a

finite-dimensional W (n)-module all of whose simple subquotients are Kac modules with nonintegral highest

weight. Then we construct a projective resolution of M consisting of big Kac modules. Construct the

standard Koszul resolution

                                        · · · → P−2 → P−1 → P0 → C → 0,

                            Vi
where P−i = U (W ) ⊗U(sl)        (W/sl), which is exact. Tensoring by M , and using indgp (X) ⊗C Y = indgp (X ⊗C

res Y ), we get a projective resolution



                                 · · · → indW                     W
                                            sl (W/sl) ⊗C M ) → indsl M → M → 0



                                                                                            Vi
from which we would like to calculate extensions of M . It is projective, since each             (W/sl) ⊗ M is a

sl-module all of whose simple subquotients are typical, hence projective, Kac modules.

   Note that the following results are vacuous unless n ≥ 3.


Theorem 5.2. Let λ ∈ Λ+ \ Zn , and let α be a root of (W/sl)1 (i.e., α is a root of the complement of sl
           Pn
in W and     i=1   αi = 1) such that λ + α ∈ Λ+ . Then Ext1 (Kλ , Kλ+α ) 6= 0. Moreover, the dimension of the

space of extensions is equal to the multiplicity of Kλ+α in (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ .


Corollary 5.3. Let λ ∈ Λ+ be any weight, and let α be a root of (W/sl)1 . Then dim Ext1 (Kλ , Kλ+α ) ≥

[(W/sl) ⊗ Kλ : Kλ+α ].


Proof of Theorem 5.2. The condition on λ ensures that all the Kac modules involved are sl-typical. By the

remarks above, in M there is a projective resolution

so it is a direct sum of Kac modules.

   We can calculate ExtM (Kλ , N ) as the cohomology of the complex



                                      HomM (P0 , N ) → HomM (P−1 , N ) → · · · .



Now,                                                                       
                                                                           
                                                                           0    if µ 6= ξ,
                                                                           
                                                                           
                           HomW (indW
                                    sl Kµ , Kξ ) = Homsl (Kµ , Kξ ) =
                                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                           C    if µ = ξ.
                                                                           


Therefore, if we substitute N = Kλ+α into the above complex, we get


                                                        δ
         Homsl (Kλ , Kλ+α ) → Homsl (W/sl ⊗ Kλ , Kλ+α ) → Homsl ( 2 (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ , Kλ+α ) → · · · ,
                                                                 V




so there are no coboundaries, and we claim that every f ∈ Homsl (W/sl ⊗ Kλ , Kλ+α ) gives a cocycle. Indeed,
                                 V2
(δf )(x) = f (dx), where d :          (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ → (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ , and it is easy to verify that there are no
                           V2                                                                                 Pn
nonzero sl-module maps          (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ → Kλ+α : define the height of a weight (λ1 , . . . , λn ) to be    i=1   λi .
                                          V2                   L
Then the height of any ν such that             (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ =    ν   Kν is greater than or equal to ht(λ) + 2, while

ht(λ + α) = ht(λ) + ht(α) = ht(λ) + 1. This weight calculation shows that Kλ+α simply does not occur

among the Kν , and we are done.

   Since all the Kac modules are typical, we can calculate the decomposition of (W/sl) ⊗ Kλsl into a direct

sum of Kac modules as the decomposition of (W/sl) ⊗ Lλ into a direct sum of gl(n)-modules. In particular,

for α as in Theorem 5.2, the multiplicity of Kλ+α is nonzero.


Proof of Corollary 5.3. Consider the cohomology H 1 W, Hom(Kλ+(t···t) , Kλ+α+(t···t) ) as t ∈ C varies. The
                                                                                      

complex computing this cohomology is finite-dimensional, and shifting the weights by t does not change the

dimension of the components. We can therefore view it as a complex with fixed terms with a differential

that depends polynomially on t. By Theorem 5.2, dim H 1 = (W/sl) ⊗ Kλ : Kλ+α for generic values of t.
                                                                           


By semicontinuity, dim H 1 can only increase at special values.




6     Blocks and wildness

A block of an Abelian category M is defined to be an indecomposable full Abelian subcategory that is a

direct summand. Given a subset Γ ⊆ Irr M, we denote by M(Γ) the full subcategory of M consisting of

objects all of whose simple subquotients are in Γ.

    In this section, we take M to be the category of all finite-dimensional representations of W (n). All

objects of M are generalised weight modules, therefore there is a decomposition according to weight and

parity: define parameters t = (t̄, p(t)) ∈ (C/Z) × Z2 .

    We need the following facts about representations of Lie superalgebras:


Lemma 6.1. Let g be a Lie superalgebra (with a fixed Cartan h), and M be a generalised weight module.

                                                                                          { M (λ) | λ ∈ t } ⊆ M .
            L                                                                            L
Then M =      t∈h∗      M (t) as a g-module, where Q is the root lattice, and M (t) =
                 0 /Q




                                                                          M (α) as a vector space (recall that, for
                                                                  L
Proof. Consider a generalised weight module M , so that M =           α


α ∈ h∗0 , the subspace M (α) ⊆ M is simply { v ∈ M | ∀H ∈ h0 ∃n ∈ Z+ (H − α(H))n v = 0 } in this case).

We have the following simple fact: if λ, µ ∈ h∗0 , then U (g)(λ) M (µ) ⊆ M (λ+µ) . An immediate consequence is

that the M (t), defined above, are submodules.


Lemma 6.2. Let g be as in the previous lemma, and assume that, for every α ∈ ∆, we have dim g(α) = (0|k)

or (k|0). Suppose M is a generalised weight module whose support is contained in a single Q-coset t = λ+Q.

Then there exists a parity function σ : M → M , commuting with the action of g, such that M = M ′ ⊕ M ′′ ,

defined by M ′ = { v ∈ M | σ(v) = v }, M ′′ = { v ∈ M | σ(v) = −v }.


Proof. First, define a parity p : ∆ → Z2 by p(α) = p(Xα ) for some Xα ∈ g(α) ; this is well-defined, by our

hypothesis. It extends linearly to a function p : Q → Z2 .



                                                          9
   Now, suppose M is a generalised weight module whose support is contained in a single Q-coset t =

λ + Q. Shift the parity function to p : t → Z2 by setting p(λ + α) = p(λ) + p(α), where p(λ) ∈ Z2 is fixed
                                                                                                                  (µ)
arbitrarily. Consider the linear map σ : M → M , uniquely defined by requiring that, if v ∈ Md , then
                                                                                    (µ+α)
σ(v) = (−1)p(µ)−d v. Finally, note that, if Xα ∈ g(α) , then Xα v ∈ Md+p(α) , so σ(Xα v) = (−1)p(µ)−d Xα v =

Xα σ(v). Therefore σ commutes with the action of g, and M breaks up into a direct sum of two submodules,

determined by this new parity.


Proposition 6.3. Let g = W (n), and let M be a generalised weight g-module. Then M decomposes, as a

g-module, into a direct sum


                                         M                    M
                                 M=               M (t̄) =              M (t̄)′ ⊕ M (t̄)′′ ,

                                                                 0 /Q




defined by Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2.


   Since we are interested in finite-dimensional modules, we see that Γt̄ consists of simple modules whose

highest weight λ satisfies λ1 ≡ t̄ (mod Z), where t̄ ∈ C/Z. The categories M(Γ′t̄ ) and M(Γ′′t̄ ) are equivalent

via parity-reversal, and for what follows we will not worry about whether a highest weight is “even” or

“odd”, that being determined according to Lemma 6.2.


Theorem 6.4. The decomposition
                                                             M
                                              M=                        Mt
                                                       t∈(C/Z)×Z2


is the block decomposition of M, i.e., the categories Mt = M(Γt ) are indecomposable.


Proof. We define a relation      on the set of highest weights, such that λ                    µ implies the existence of a

finite-dimensional indecomposable having both S(λ) and S(µ) as subquotients, and, consequently, that S(λ)

and S(µ) are in the same M-block. Finally, we show that if S(λ), S(µ) ∈ Γt , i.e., if λ1 ≡ µ1 (mod Z), then

we can get from λ to µ with a finite number of intermediate steps.

   If t̄ 6∈ Z, then all Kac modules in Mt are simple. In that case, by Theorem 5.2, there exists a nonsplit

extension of S(λ) by S(λ + εi ) as long as λ + εi ∈ Λ+ .

   For the atypical case t̄ ∈ Z, Corollary 5.3 still ensures that there is an indecomposable module with

                                                             10
subquotients K(λ) and K(λ + εi ), and hence both S(λ) and S(λ + εi ) are subquotients, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n such

that λ + εi ∈ Λ+ .

   The relation λ     µ is now defined as follows: set λ          µ if µ = λ + εi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We have

established that λ    µ implies that λ and µ are in the same block. Finally, it is clear that the closure of

to an equivalence relation on Λ+ has equivalence classes which are exactly the cosets (λ + Q) ∩ Λ+ .


Theorem 6.5. Each block Mt is wild.


Proof. Let λ ∈ Λ+ be a weight such that K(λ) ∈ Ob(Mt ), K(λ) is simple, λ + α ∈ Λ+ for every root

α of (W/sl)1 , and all the K(λ + α) are also simple. For example, any sufficiently dominant weight, i.e.,

λ1 ≫ λ2 ≫ · · · ≫ λn , with λi ≡ t̄ (mod Z), will do. Then, by Corollary 5.3, there exists a nontrivial

extension of K(λ) = S(λ) by K(λ + α) = S(λ + α).

   Therefore, the Ext-quiver of each block contains a subquiver consisting of a vertex λ with arrows from
                                                                                         n
                                                                                          
it to λ + α for each root α of (W/sl)1 . Not counting multiplicities, there are 3        3    + n such roots, namely,
                                                                                 n
                                                                                     
εi + εj − εk with 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n and i 6= j. Since n ≥ 3, we always have 3      3       + n > 5, and the resulting

quiver is already wild (q.v. Proposition 2.1):



                                                           λ + α1

                                                           λ + α2

                                             λ               ..
                                                              .

                                                           λ + αd




   The original version of this paper used a much more cumbersome method to establish the block decom-

position. The advantage of the present approach is that much less calculation is necessary. Also, it seems

that the argument in Theorem 5.3 may be refined to calculate all extensions between two (generic) Kac

modules, and that the projective resolution will give an easy proof of


Conjecture 6.6. All blocks not containing the trivial representation are equivalent.

7       The centre of U W (n)

Consider the standard embedding sl(1, n) ֒→ W (n). Let h = h0 ⊂ gl(n) ⊂ sl(1, n) be the standard Cartan,

and fix a triangular decomposition g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ of W (n) such that b+ = n+ ⊕ h is also the positive Borel

of a triangular decomposition of sl(1, n).

    Define the Verma modules

Induction by stages gives M (λ) = U (W )⊗U(sl) slM (λ). Let slL(λ) be the unique irreducible quotient of slM (λ).

    The following result is proved in [6], Section 3:


Lemma 7.1. Let S ⊆ h∗0 . Then

Lemma 7.4. If u ∈ Z, then there exists a scalar c ∈ C such that u − c ∈         µ∈Γ

Proof. For any µ ∈ h∗ , we have Endg M (µ) = C, therefore c acts by some scalar cµ on M (µ). It therefore

also acts by multiplication by cµ on the finite-dimensional quotient Vb (µ) of M (µ). Furthermore, if Vb (µ)

and Vb (µ′ ) are in the same block, then cµ = cµ′ . However, by Theorem 6.4, any block Γ is already a Zariski

dense subset of h∗ .
