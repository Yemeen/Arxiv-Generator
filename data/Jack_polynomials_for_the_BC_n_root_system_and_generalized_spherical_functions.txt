                                                                           Introduction
                                                Functions on a homogeneous space G/K invariant with respect to the
                                             left action of K are called spherical functions (or sometimes K-spherical).
                                             One can also study functions on G/K with values in a representation V of
                                             G which are equivariant with respect to the left action of K. This more
                                             general class of functions may be called vector valued spherical functions.
                                             The theory of such functions was developed by Harish-Chandra, Helgason
                                             and other authors [1],[2],[3].
                                                In the case when G = K × K and K ⊂ G is the diagonal subgroup, the
                                             study of vector valued spherical functions is equivalent to the study of func-
                                             tions on K, equivariant with respect to conjugation. When K is reductive
                                             over C, the Peter-Weyl theorem gives a description of the space of conjugacy
                                             equivariant functions as the space spanned by the vector valued characters
                                             of K. The article [4] deals with such kind of spherical functions in the case
                                             when K = SL(n, C). Namely, the Laplace operator on K restricted to the
                                             space of spherical functions can be written in terms of coordinates along
                                             the maximal torus. If the vector valued equivariant functions take values
                                             in V = S κn Cn , then the resulting operator (the so called radial part of the
                                             Laplacian) coincides, up to an obvious conjugation, with the Sutherland
                                             differential operator, which is the Hamiltonian of the Calogero-Moser quan-
                                             tum mechanical system for the root system An−1 [10], [12], [11]. Differential
                                             operators on K corresponding to the higher Casimir operators can also be
                                             written in terms of coordinates along the maximal torus. These operators are
                                             quantum integrals of the Calogero-Moser system. Moreover, Weyl group in-
                                             variant eigenfunctions of the Sutherland operator can be expressed as vector
                                             valued traces of some intertwining operators between some particular repre-
                                             sentations of K. By the results from [5] these eigenfunctions are essentially
                                             Jack polynomials for the root system An−1 (up to a Weyl-determinantlike
                                             factor).
                                                The main result of this paper is a representation theoretic interpretation
                                             (in the spirit of the work [4]) of the three parameter family of BCn Jack
                                             polynomials. More precisely, we consider the case of the pair G = GL(m +
                                             n, C) (m ≥ n), K = GL(m, C) × GL(n, C), slightly modify the definition of
                                             spherical functions and as result we get a similar to [4] theory for the root
                                             system BCn . Namely, in this case the Laplace operator on G, written in
                                                                                   1
terms of coordinates of some torus inside G, yields the Sutherland operator
for the root system BCn , and the higher Casimir operators give quantum
integrals of the corresponding quantum mechanical system.
   Furthermore, the restriction to the torus of some special matrix elements
of irreducible finite dimensional representations Lλ of G, where λ ranges
over the set isomorphic to the cone of dominant integral weights of the root
system Cn , yields W -invariant eigenfunctions of the Sutherland differen-
tial operator. The Sutherland differential operator after a suitable gauge
transformation becomes operator from the paper [5]. By [5] BCn Jack poly-
nomials are Weyl group invariant eigenfunctions of this operator. Thus we
obtain a representation theoretic interpretation of Jack polynomials.
   In [6] (see also [7] for compact exposition of the result and for its q-analog)
a one parameter family of the BCn Jack polynomials was constructed by
means of spherical functions on G. This family is a subfamily of the three
parameter family of BCn Jack polynomials from theorem 2 below. We also
mention that in the one dimensional case our construction reduces to the
result of the paper [8].
   The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 1,we give an interpre-
tation of the results on vector valued characters from [4] using the point of
view of the theory of symmetric spaces. Section 2 contains the main result:
the construction of Jack polynomials through vector valued twisted spheri-
cal functions on the symmetric space G/K. The proofs of the claims from
Section 2 are given in Section 3. All constructions are easier for the special
case m = n, κ(1) + κ(2) = 0 and to gain a better understanding, the reader
is advised to consider this special case separately.
   The results of this paper can be generalized to the case of quantum sym-
metric spaces [9]. The quantum version of the construction yields the five
parameter family of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials, which are q ana-
log of Jack polynomials.

           1. Jack polynomials for the An−1 root system
   In this section we explain how to interpret the results of the paper [4]
from the point of view of the theory of symmetric spaces. This section does
not contain any proofs. It just outlines the results from [4].

1.1. The space of spherical functions. Let K be the group SL(n, C) =
SL(n) and G = K × K. The diagonal embedding K ֒→ K × K gives rise to
                                        2
the left and right action of K on G. Let V (κ) be the representation S nκ Cn
of K, κ ∈ Z+ .
   The space of K-spherical functions Fκ is defined by the formula
         Fκ = {f ∈ F (G, V (κ))|f (kgk ′ ) = kf (g), ∀k, k′ ∈ K, g ∈ G},
where F (G, V (κ)) is the space of V (κ) valued polynomial functions on G.
The quotient space G/K can be identified with the group K: (x, y) →
xy −1 . Under this identification the right action of group K becomes the
conjugation action and
          Fκ = {f ∈ F (K, V (κ))|f (kk′ k−1 ) = kf (k′ ), ∀k, k′ ∈ K}.

1.2. The restriction of spherical functions to a maximal torus and
differential operators. Obviously the restriction of a function from Fκ to
the maximal torus H = {eh(x) |h(x) = diag(x1 , . . . , xn ), tr(h(x)) = 0} takes
values in the one-dimensional space V (κ)[0], that is it can be regarded as a
scalar function.
   Furthermore, functions from Fκ are uniquely determined by their restric-
tion to the maximal torus (because the generic element of K is conjugate to
an element of H). The Laplace operator on K being restricted to Fκ takes
the form:
                                                                        
                 n    2                                             3−n
                X   ∂              X             1                n
    L̄κ = δ−1          − κ(κ + 1)                              −         δ,
                i=1
                   ∂x2i               2 sinh2 ((xi − xj )/2)
                                      i<j
                                                                    12
           Q
where δ = i<j sinh((xi − xj )/2) and xi (i = 1, . . . , n) are the natural coor-
dinates on H. The operator δL̄κ δ−1 coincides, up to an additive constant,
with the Sutherland operator – the Hamiltonian of the quantum n-body
system on the line with interaction potential κ(κ + 1) sinh−2 (y/2).
   If C1 , . . . , Cn are generators of the center Z(k) of the universal enveloping
algebra U (k) of the Lie algebra k of the group K, then the corresponding
differential operators on K map the space Fκ into itself. Hence the restric-
tion of such operator to the space Fκ is a uniquely determined differential
operator and it is possible to express it in terms of coordinates along the
maximal torus. Let us denote such differential operator on the torus by RCi .

1.3. The connection with quantum integrable systems. Recall that
an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian of a quantum physical system
is called a quantum integral of this system. Let L be a differential operator in
n variables. One says that L defines a completely integrable quantum Hamil-
tonian system if there exists a set of n algebraically independent quantum
integrals L1 , . . . , Ln which are differential operators and commute with each
other. The collection of operators L1 , . . . , Ln is called a complete system of
quantum integrals for L.
   It is clear from the above that we have following proposition
                                        3
Proposition 1. (1)[12] The Sutherland differential operator defines a com-
pletely integrable system; moreover
   (2)[14] The operators δRCi δ−1 , i = 1, . . . , n form a complete system of
quantum integrals for this system.

1.4. Jack polynomials. Below we give a definition of Jack polynomials fol-
lowing the work [5]. The action of the operator L̃κ = δ−κ L̄κ δκ on the space
C[P ]W of Weyl invariant Laurent polynomialsPon H is diagonalizable, and
the eigenfunctions have the form Jλκ = mλ + ν<λ sλν mν , where mλ (x) =
          (ν,x) , where λ ∈ P (SL(n)) = {λ ∈ Zn |λ ≥ λ ≥ · · · ≥ λ } is an
P
   ν∈W λ e                   +                     1     2           n
integral dominant weight, defined up to shift, and < is the standard partial
order on weights. Polynomials Jλκ are called Jack polynomials for the root
system An−1 .

1.5. The formula for the spherical eigenfunction. Let Lλ be the finite
dimensional representation of K with highest weight λ ∈ P+ (SL(n)) and
L∗λ is its dual. Then the restriction of the finite dimensional representation
Lλ ⊠ L∗λ , of G = K × K to the diagonally embedded subgroup K yields the
representation   Lλ ⊗L∗λ of K. The tensor product Lλ ⊗L∗λ contains the vector
          ui ⊗ ui (where {ui } is a basis of Lλ and {u∗i } is the corresponding
                 ∗
       P
w0 =
dual basis of L∗λ ), which is stable with respect to the (diagonal) action of K.
If λ = µ + κρ, ρ = 12 α>0 α, µ ∈ P+ (SL(n)), then Lλ ⊗ L∗λ also contains a
                       P
unique copy of the irreducible representation V (κ).
   Thus for the tensor product one can write a decomposition

                           Lλ ⊗ L∗λ = V (κ) ⊕ ⊕µ∈Cλ Lµ ,

Cλ ⊂ P+ (SL(n)), V (k) 6= Lµ for all µ ∈ Cλ . Hence      P    a vector u ∈ Lλ ⊗ L∗λ
can be uniquely presented in the form u = ũ + µ∈Cλ uµ , where ũ ∈ V (κ),
uµ ∈ Lµ . This decomposition gives an embedding s: V ∗ (κ) ֒→ L∗λ ⊗ Lλ ,
s(x)(u) = x(ũ).
  Let v1 , . . . , vN be a basis of representation V (κ). Then one can construct
the function
                                       X
                             Ψµ (g) =      vi hs(vi∗ ), gw0 i

(where vi∗ , i = 1, . . . , N is a basis dual to the basis vi , i = 1, . . . , N ). This
function belongs to the space Fκ . The maximal torus of K is embedded in
G by map eh(x) 7→ (eh(x) , 1), and the restriction of Ψµ to this torus has the
form
                           Ψµ (x) = wκ hs(wκ∗ ), eh(x) w0 i,
where wκ∗ , wκ are the vectors such that V (κ)∗ [0] = span{wκ∗ }, V (κ)[0] =
span{wκ } and hwκ , wκ∗ i = 1. Let us identify V (κ)[0] with C via wκ →
hwκ , vλ∗ ⊗ vλ i, where vλ and vλ∗ are the highest and lowest weight vectors for
the representations Lλ and L∗λ , respectively.
                                           4
1.6. The main theorem. An element of the center of the universal en-
veloping algebra U (k ⊕ k) acts on the space Lλ ⊠ L∗λ by a constant. In
particular, the element Ci ∈ U (k), embedded into U (k ⊕ k) via x 7→ (x, 0)
(x ∈ k), does. Hence Ψµ (x) is an eigenfunction of RCi . Obviously, Ψµ (x) is
W -invariant when κ is even and W antiinvariant when κ is odd. Moreover,
the following theorem holds:
Theorem. [4] Under the above identification of V (κ)[0] with C:
 (1) Ψ0 (x) = δ(x)κ .
 (2) Ψµ (x) is divisible by Ψ0 (x) in algebra C[P ] for all µ ∈ P+ (SL(n)).
 (3) Ψµ (x)/Ψ0 (x) = Jµκ (x).

           2. Jack polynomials for the BCn root system
   In this section we explain a representation theoretic construction of the
three parameter family of Jack polynomials for the root system BCn . We
postpone all proofs (which are mostly lengthy calculations) for the next
section.
2.1. The symmetric pair (G, K) and restricted root system. In this
section we introduce notations for representation theoretic objects which are
necessary for a further exposition.
    Let G be the group GL(m + n, C) = GL(m + m) and g its Lie algebra,
where m ≥ n. The conjugation by the diagonal matrix J ∈ G, Jii = 1,
i = 1, . . . , m, Jjj = −1, j = m + 1, . . . , m + n defines an involution Θ:
Θ(g) = JgJ −1 . Θ-invariant elements of G form a subgroup K = K(1) ×
K(2) = GL(m) × GL(n) ⊂ G. The differential of this involution at the
unit acts on the Lie algebra g and induces the decomposition g = k ⊕ p,
k = {x ∈ g|dΘ(x) = x}, p = {x ∈ g|dΘ(x) = −x} ( k is exactly the
Lie algebra of the group K).The subspace p ⊂ g is not a subalgebra of g
but nevertheless one can fix a maximal abelian subalgebra a inside p. We
use notation A for the corresponding abelian subgroup. Below we fix some
particular subgroup A which we will work with.
    Before fixing the choice of A we introduce the Cartan subgroup H of
the group G. The subgroup H is conjugated to the subgroup of the di-
agonal matrices by matrix J˜. Matrix J˜ consists of the diagonal blocks:
J˜ii = J˜m+i,i = J˜i+m,i+m = −J˜i,i+m = √12 , i = 1, . . . , n, J˜j+n,j+n = 1,
j = 1, . . . , m − n and all other entries are zero:

We denote by the symbol h(x, y, z) an element of H of the form Je
        n
x, z ∈ C , y ∈ C m−n . Let h be a Lie algebra of H.
   We put A to be equal to exp(p) ∩ H or A = {h(x, 0, −x), x ∈ Cn }.
We use notation ea(x) = h(x, 0, −x), x ∈ Cn for the elements of A, where
                                       5
a(x) = ni=1 xi (Ei+m,i −Ei,i+m ) ∈ g, Eij is the notation for the ij-th matrix
       P
unit (basis in g).
  The inclusion a: a ֒→ h induces the projection h∗ ։ a∗ . The root system
R ⊂ h∗ is mapped under this projection onto the restricted root system.
The restricted root system is isomorphic to the root system Cn , in the case
n = m, and to the root system BCn , in the case m > n. We use the notation
Σ for the root system BCn . The short, medium and long positive roots of
Σ are the vectors:
(1)    εi   (1 ≤ i ≤ n),    εi ± εj    (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n),    2εi   (1 ≤ i ≤ n),
where εi (a(x)) = xi . The root multiplicities for the short, medium and
long roots of Σ are t1 = 2(m − n), t2 = 2, t3 = 1. Below we use the half
multiplicities si = ti /2, i = 1, 2, 3. The bilinear form (·, ·) on a∗ is the
standard one: (εi , εj ) = δij .
   Let us also introduce notations for a generalization of the Weyl denomi-
nator:                                  Y
                      δp1 ,p2 ,p3 (x) =   sinhpα (α(a(x))),
                                       α∈Σ+
and for the vector:
                                              1 X
                              ρp1 ,p2 ,p3 =       pα α,
                                              2
                                                  α∈Σ+
where p±εi = p1 , p±εi ±εj = p2 (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), p±2εi = p3 (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n).
Below we always use the convention that for the given vector p~ ∈ C3 , pα
means the same thing as in the previous formula if α ∈ Σ and pα = 0 if
α∈/ Σ.
2.2. Vector valued spherical functions. In this subsection we define the
space of K-equivariant twisted vector valued functions on G. Functions from
this space take values in the space of the particular representation of K. In
principle one has a lot of freedom in the choice of this representation and
it is not clear why the chosen representation is better than any others. We
will explain it in the next subsection.
   First we define the space of ”twisted” scalar valued functions on G/K:
      F̂ = {f ∈ F |f (gk) = f (g)detκ(1) (k(1) )detκ(2) (k(2) ), ∀k ∈ K, g ∈ G},
where F is the space of polynomial functions on G and k = k(1) k(2) , k(i) ∈
K(i) . The desired space of spherical vector valued K-spherical functions is
a subspace of the tensor product F̂ ⊗ Uκ  ~ where Uκ~ is a representation of K
which we define below.
   Let us fix notations for finite dimensional representations of GL(r). A fi-
nite dimensional irreducible representation of GL(r) is encoded by its highest
weight λ ∈ Zr , λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λr , which is dominant and integral. We de-
note the corresponding representation by Lλ and the set of highest weights
by P+ (GL(r)). The determinant representation in our notations is L1r , 1r
is the r-dimensional vector consisting of ones, 1r = (1, . . . , 1).
                                              6
   The representation Uκ       ~ of the group K = K(1) × K(2) = GL(m) × GL(n)
is of the form Uκ   ~  =    W  ~ ⊠ Vκ
                               κ      ~ and element k = k(1) k(2) ∈ K acts on u =
w ⊗ v ∈ Uκ  ~ by formula k(u) = k(1) (w) ⊗ k(2) (v).
   The representation Wκ         ~ is the an irreducible representation Lµ , (κ̃(1) −
κ(1) )1n + κ(1) 1m of the group K(1) = GL(m). Here κ̃(1) , κ(1) are integers
and 1n ∈ P+ (GL(m)) is a vector of the form (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0) with ones at
first n places and zeroes at other places. Why we choose such representation
is clear from lemma 1.
                                                                         κ(2) +κ(1) −κ̃(1)
   The representation Vκ      ~ is an irreducible representation Lλ ⊗det
of K(2) = GL(n), where λ = (κv (n − 1), −κv , . . . , −κv ). More explicitly, the
representation Lλ is the representation S κv n Cn (i.e. κv n symmetric power
of the vector representation) of P GL(n) pulled back to GL(n) i.e. the cen-
ter acts trivially. The main reason why we choose this representation is
that zero weight space of Lλ is one-dimensional. Below we use notation
~ = (κ(1) , κ(2) , κ̃(1) , κv ).

Remark 1. In the simplest case, when m = n, Wκ ~ ≃ det
                                                        κ̃(1)
                                                              is one-dimensional.
So Uκ
    ~ becomes the representation det
                                     κ̃(1)
                                           ⊠(det−κ̃(1) ⊗Lλ ).
  Combining all components we get a definition of the space of K-equivariant
vector valued twisted spherical functions:
              Fκ
               ~ = {f ∈ F̃ ⊗ Uκ
                              ~ |f (kg) = kf (g), ∀k ∈ K, g ∈ G}.

For brevity we call the functions from this space spherical functions.
Remark 2. In the case κv = 0, κ(1) = κ̃(1) , this space was studied in the
first part of the book [6].
2.3. Properties of the spherical functions. In this subsection we ex-
plain why the restriction of a spherical function on the torus A is a scalar
function.
   Elementary arguments from the linear algebra show that the generic ele-
ment g of G can be presented in the form g = kea(x) k′ , k, k′ ∈ K, x ∈ Cn and
this decomposition is unique up to the action of the Weyl group. Because
of the bi-K-equivariance of the functions from Fκ ~ , any function f ∈ Fκ  ~ is
uniquely determined by its restriction to A.
   The element y of the group M = ZK (A) = GL(m − n) acts on a spherical
function f following way:
            yf (ea(x) ) = f (yea(x) ) = f (ea(x) y) = f (ea(x) ) det(y)κ(1) .
  That is the restriction of a spherical function takes values in the subspace
W̃κ
  ~ ⊠ Vκ
       ~ , where W̃κ
                   ~ is a subspace on which M acts by the character det
                                                                          κ(1)
                                                                               .
Lemma 1. The subspace W̃κ    ~ is one-dimensional. The subgroup K̃(1) =
ZK(1) (M ) = GL(n) acts on W̃κ~ by the character det
                                                    κ̃(1)
                                                          .
  The proof of the lemma is given at the section 3.
                                            7
Remark 3. In the simplest case m = n, the lemma is trivial, since then Wκ~
reduces to the one-dimensional representation detκ̃(1) of K(1) = K̃(1) .
   Now let T ⊂ K be the subgroup T = K ∩ H = {k ∈ K|k = h(x, z, x), x ∈
Cn , z ∈ Cm−n }. Observe that T ⊂ K̃(1) × M × K(2) and elements of T com-
mutes with A. An element h2 = ediag(0,0,z) , z ∈ Cn of the Cartan subgroup
of K(2) can be presented in the form h2 = th1 , where h1 = ediag(−z,0,0) ∈ K̃(1)
and t ∈ T . Hence using det(h1 ) det(h2 ) = 1 one gets for a spherical function
f:
   h2 f (ea(x) ) = f (h1 tea(x) ) = h1 f (ea(x) )t = det(h2 )κ(1) +κ(2) −κ̃(1) f (ea(x) ).
   That means that the restriction of f to A takes values in the one-dimensional
space W̃κ                                                n
         ~ ⊠ Ṽκ
               ~ , with Ṽκ
                          ~ = Vκ
                               ~ [(κ(1) + κ(2) − κ̃(1) )1 ] ≃ C. That is, the re-
striction of a spherical function f to A is a scalar valued function.

2.4. The center of U (g) and radial parts of biinvariant differential
operators. In this subsection we explain the correspondence between ele-
ments of the center of the universal enveloping algebra and the Weyl group
invariant differential operators on A. This correspondence is given by the
radial parts of the differential operators. Finally we calculate the radial part
of the Casimir operator.
   The universal enveloping algebra U (g) may be identified with the algebra
of the left G-invariant differential operators on G. Namely, the element
                                                    d
x ∈ g gives the differential operator Dx f (g) = dt   f (getx )|t=0 and this map
can be extended to U (g): Dxy f = Dx Dy f , for x, y ∈ U (g). A differential
operator corresponding to an element of the center Z(g) of the universal
enveloping algebra U (g) is bi-G-invariant, hence it preserves the space Fκ     ~.
As any function from Fκ   ~ is uniquely determined  by   its restriction to A, the
differential operator DC , C ∈ Z(g) can be written in terms of coordinates
along A, and the resulting operator is a differential operator with coefficients
in End(Ũκ ~ ) = C. We call this expression the radial part of DC on Fκ     ~ and
denote it RC .
Remark 4. In reality, not any function on the torus A is the restriction
of a K-biequivariant function. Later we will show that the restriction of
the functions from Fκ                                                 2xi (x ,
                         ~ span the space of Laurent polynomials of e       i
i = 1, . . . , n, are the coordinates along the torus A) satisfying vanishing
conditions at zero locus locus of Weyl determinant (see lemma 5), on which
W acts by the character χ (see lemma 4). Here W is the Weyl group for
the BCn root system and χ is the Z2 -character of W . But the standard
reasoning (see for example [6] page 16) shows that a differential operator is
uniquely determined by its action on the space of χ-W invariant Laurent
polynomials, hence the radial part of DC is uniquely defined.
                                                         P
   The center Z(g) ⊂ U (g) contains the Casimir C2 = 1≤i,j≤n+m Eij Eji .
The radial part RC2 can be calculated explicitly. Below we use following
                                             8
notations ~κ = (κ1 , κ2 , κ3 ) = (κ(2) − κ(1) , κv , κ̃(1) − κ(2) ), ~r = ~κ + ~s. We
consider only the case when ~κ satisfies the following condition:
(2)                                  κ3 ≥ κ1 + κ3 ≥ 0.
Theorem 1. The second order differential operator RC2 has the form

(3) 2(RC2 ψ)(x) = δ~s−1 (x) (∆A − u~r (x) + Cκ
                                             ~ ) δ~s (x)ψ(x),

where ∆A =         i=1 ∂x2i   is the Laplace operator.

   The operator L~rCM = ∆A − u~r (x) is called the Calogero-Moser operator
for the root system BCn .
Remark 5. When κ(1) + κ(2) = 0, m = n, the coefficient Cκ       ~ is equal to
−2(ρ, ρ) (ρ is half sum of the positive roots of the root system Am+n−1 ).
2.5. The spherical representations of G. In this subsection we describe
the finite dimensional representations of G containing the representation Uκ    ~
of K. Proofs of the statements use the Littlewood-Richardson rule and are
given at the next section.
   First we introduce some new definitions and notations. Let us denote by
P κ(1) ,κ(2) , κ(1) , κ(2) ∈ Z, (κ(1) ≥ κ(2) by (2)) the subset of P+ (GL(n + m))
consisting of λ ∈ P+ (GL(n + m)) such that G-representation Lλ |K contains
a copy of detκ(1) ⊗ detκ(2) .
Lemma 2. λ ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) if and only if
       λj + λm+n+1−j = κ(1) + κ(2)                      (j = 1, . . . , n)
                     λn+j = κ(1)                        (j = 1, . . . , m − n)
                       λn ≥ κ(1) .
Moreover, if λ ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) then Lλ |K contains a unique copy of the repre-
sentation detκ(1) ⊠ detκ(2) .
Remark 6. In the case when all κ(i) are zero the last lemma follows from
the fact that (G, K) is a symmetric pair (see [13] Chapter V, Theorem 4.1).
  We denote by the symbol P+BC the set of n-tuples of non-negative integers
µ ∈ Zn+ such that µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ · · · ≥ µn ≥ 0. Now consider the map τ :
P+BC → Zm+n , where
       τ (µ) = (µ1 + κ̂, . . . , µn + κ̂, κ(1) , . . . , κ(1) , κ̂ − µn , . . . , κ̂ − µ1 ),
                                                9
κ(1) +κ(2)
     2   = κ̂. Lemma 2 says that λ ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) if and only if λ = τ (ρ−κ1 ,0,0 +
µ) for some µ ∈ P+BC . That is, lemma 2 implies that the set P κ(1) ,κ(2) is
isomorphic to P+BC .

Definition. A finite dimensional irreducible representation Lλ of G is called
κ             κ is integer and satisfies (2)), if λ ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) and Lλ |K ⊃ Uκ
~ -spherical (~                                                                 ~.
                     ~
Let us denote by P a set of weights λ such that Lλ is κ
                     κ                                         ~ -spherical.

Lemma 3. If µ ∈ P+BC then λ = τ (µ + ρ~κ ) ∈ P κ ~ , and in this case L |
                                                                       λ K
contains a unique copy of the representation Uκ
                                              ~.

   Also lemma 2 and (2) imply that τ (µ + ρ~κ ) ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) for µ ∈ P+BC .

Remark 7. The statement converse to the lemma 3 also holds. It follows
from the statements that are stated below (see corollary 1). Let us also
remark that in the simplest case ( n = m, κ(1) + κ(2) = 0) the map τ does
not depend on κ~.

2.6. Spherical functions through κ
                                 ~ -spherical representations. For
λ ∈ Pκ~ we have a decomposition


                                    ~ ⊕(µ,µ′ )∈Cλ Lµ ⊠ Lµ′ ,
                           Lλ |K = Uκ

Cλ ⊂ P+ (GL(m)) ⊕ P+ (GL(n)).      P Hence a vector v ∈ Lλ can be uniquely
presented in the form v = ṽ + (µ,µ′ )∈Cλ vµ,µ′ , ṽ ∈ Uκ     ~ , vµ,µ′ ∈ Lµ ⊠ Lµ′ . It
allows us to define an embedding s: Uκ         ∗ ֒→ L∗ | , s(x)(v) = x(ṽ).
                                              ~      λ K
   Let uκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ) ∈ Lλ , λ ∈ P κ(1) ,κ(2) be a vector such that

                       span{uκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ)} = detκ(1) ⊠ detκ(2) .

The vector uκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ) is unique up to normalization. Now consider the
function Ψµ : G → Uκ            BC
                       ~ , µ ∈ P+ , given by
                                X
                     Ψµ (g) =      vi hs(vi∗ ), guκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ)i,

where λ = τ (µ + ρκ   ~ ) and vi , i = 1, . . . , N is a basis of the representation
Uκ                  ∗
 ~ ⊂ Lλ |K and vi , i = 1, . . . , N is a dual basis. It is easy to see that Ψµ ∈ Fκ         ~
and that its restriction to A is equal to wκ         hs(w ∗ ), ea(x) u            (λ)i,  where

span{wκ  } =  Ũ   , span{w ∗ } = Ũ ∗ and hw ∗ , w i = 1. We identify Ũ with

C via wκ

                           Ψµ (x) = hwκ

Remark 8. Such definition for Ψµ has a flaw. The vectors wκ
                                                          ~   κ(1) ,κ(2) are
determined up to multiplication on a constant. Hence Ψµ is also defined
up to multiplication by a constant. We fix this constant at the end of
section 2.10.

Remark 9. Actually, by induction on r one can prove more precise formula:

2.8. The Weyl group invariance and factorization of the spherical
function. The Weyl group W of the BCn root system naturally maps onto
the group Sn . We denote this map by q. The group W has two independent
Z2 -characters. Indeed if t : W → GL(n, Z) is the tautological representation
of this group, then χ0 (w) = det(t(w)) and χ1 (w) = (−1)q(w) for a basis of Z2 -
characters. For the character χ = χκ0 1 +κ3 χκ1 1 +κ2 +κ3 the following statement
holds:
                                               11
Lemma 4. A function f (ea(x) ) ∈ Fκ~ transforms under the action of W
by the character χ. Besides, we have f (ea(x+πiej ) ) = (−1)κ1 f (ea(x) ) for
j = 1, . . . , n.
   The function Ψµ (x) is a Laurent polynomial of exl because Lλ is a poly-
nomial representation. Let us denote the space of Laurent polynomials in
exl , l = 1, . . . , n by C[P ].
Lemma 5. Any f (ea(x) ), f ∈ Fκ
                              ~ is divisible by δ~
                                                 κ in the algebra C[P ].

  Lemma 4 and lemma 5 imply that the function Ψµ (x)/δ~κ (x) belongs to
the space C[P ]W of W -invariant Laurent polynomials in e2xl , l = 1, . . . , n.
Moreover, the following corollary holds
                                       P
Corollary 1.       (1) Ψµ (x)/δ~κ (x) = ν≤µ dµν mν (x), where mν is the or-
        bitsum mν = λ∈W ν e2(λ,x) and ≤ is the standard BCn dominance
                      P
        order.
                 ~ then λ = τ (µ + ρ ), where µ ∈ P BC .

2.9. The definition and properties of Jack polynomials. Consider the
operator L̃~r = δ~r−1 L~rCM δ~r . For this operator the following proposition holds.

Proposition 2. [5] The operator L̃~r maps the space C[P ]W of Weyl group
invariant Laurent polynomials into itself. Moreover,      it is triangular with
                                                          2(ν,x)
                                                   P
respect to the basis of the orbitsums mλ (x) = ν∈W λ e           i.e.
                                                     X
                 L̃~r mµ = 4(µ + ρ~r , µ + ρ~r )mµ +   αµν mν .
                                                       ν<µ

    This proposition implies  P that one can uniquely determine the Laurent
polynomial Jµ~r = mµ + ν<µ sµ,ν mν by the condition L̃~r Jµ~r = 4(µ + ρ~r , µ +
ρ~r )Jµ~r . Indeed, ρ~r is a dominant weight, hence ν < µ implies (ν + ρ, ν + ρ) <
(µ + ρ, µ + ρ). Thus the operator L̃~r being restricted to the finite dimen-
sional space span{mν , ν ≥ µ} is diagonalizable with the distinct eigenvalues.
Hence Jµ~r is uniquely determined. The polynomials Jµ~r are called Jack poly-
nomials for the BCn root system.
    It is easy to see that the operator L~rCM is self-adjoint with respect to
                                             R
the standard inner product (f, g) = A∗ f (x)g(x)dx (here the bar means
complex conjugation and A∗ = {ea(x) |Rex = 0}). This fact implies that Jµ~r
is orthogonal to Jν~r if (µ + ρ~r , µ + ρ~r ) 6= (ν + ρ~r , ν + ρ~r ). In fact, an even
stronger statement holds:
Proposition 3. [5] The Jack polynomials Jµ~r , µ ∈ P+ (Sp(n)) form an or-
thogonal basis in the space C[P ]W . That is,
                                  Z
                      ~
                      r   ~
                          r
                   (Jµ , Jν )~r =   δ~r (x)δ~r (x)Jµ~r Jν~r dx = 0,
                                    A∗
if µ 6= ν.
                                          12
  This proposition and theorem 1 imply
                                                                      P
Corollary 2. The coefficient dµµ at the expansion Ψµ /δ~κ =               ν≤µ dµν mν

2.10. The formulation of the main result. The last corollary and lemma 8
(see next section) imply hvλ∗ , uκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ)i =
                                                 6 0, hvλ , wκ  ~ i 6= 0. Let us renor-
malize the function Ψ:
                             hs(wκ ∗ ), ea(x) u
                                   ~            κ(1) ,κ(2) (λ)i
                     Ψ̃µ =       ∗            ∗                  ,
                           hs(wκ ~ ), vλ ihvλ , uκ(1) ,κ(2) (λ)i
where λ = τ (µ + ρκ               ∗          ∗
                    ~ ) and vλ , vλ , hvλ , vλ i = 1 are the highest and lowest
weight vectors for the G-representations Lλ and L∗λ , respectively. Now, the
function Ψ̃µ does not depend on the choice either wκ      ∗ or u
                                                          ~      κ(1) ,κ(2) (λ) (see
the discussion at the end of section 2.6).
   The following theorem explains how to get Jack polynomials from the
spherical functions. It also gives some details about the radial parts of Cr ,
r ∈ N.
Theorem 2.      (1) Ψ̃µ /δ~κ = Jµ~r .
  (2) The radial parts RC2i , i ∈ N are pairwise commutative differential
      operators in n variables of the form
                               n
                              X       ∂ 2i   X         ∂J
               RC2i = 21−2i                +   aj (x)     .
                              j=1
                                    ∂x2i j            ∂xJ
                                              J,|J|<2i

Remark 11. In the case m = n, κ(1) + κ(2) = 0, the radial parts RC2i+1 ,
i ∈ N are zero. In the general case, the radial parts RC2i+1 , i ∈ N can be
expressed through RC2j .
   The second item of the theorem implies the complete integrability (see
previous section for the definition) of the quantum Hamiltonian system de-
fined by the Calogero-Moser operator L~CM r  . The first proof of the complete
integrability of this system was given by Olshanetsky and Perelomov [12].
The quantum integrals RC2i from the second part the theorem coincide with
the integrals from the paper [12],because after conjugation by δ~κ they are
diagonal in the basis of Jack polynomials, with the same eigenvalues as
operators from [12].

3.2. The branching rules. Let us recall the branching rules for the in-
clusion K ⊂ G (see [15]). The construction is based on the Littlewood-
Richardson rule [16, 17] which deals with partitions (and their diagrams).
A partition is a sequence of positive integer numbers λ ∈ Zr+ such that
λ1 ≥ P  λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λr ≥ 0, r is called the length of the partition. Set
|λ| = ri=1 λi . The diagram of the partition is the set of points (i, j) ∈ Zn+
such that 1 ≤ j ≤ λi . It is more convenient to replace the points by squares
(or boxes). We write µ ⊂ λ for the partitions if and only if µi ≤ λi for all i.
For a partition λ of the length less or equal r let Lλ be the corresponding
finite dimensional irreducible GL(r) representation of the highest weight λ.
   In these notations the branching rule has the form:
                                     X          X
                           Lλ |K =       Lζ ⊠       cλζτ Lτ ,
                                     ζ          τ


where λ, τ, ζ are partitions, and cλζτ is a non-negative integer coefficient given
by the Littlewood-Richardson rule. This coefficient is called the Littlewood-
Richardson number.
   Let us recall the Littlewood-Richardson rule. For this purpose I need some
basic combinatorial definitions. The set theoretic difference θ = λ \ µ, µ ⊂ λ
is called a skew diagram, and |θ| = |λ| − |µ|. A skew diagram is a horizontal
strip if and only if it has at most one square in each column. A tableau T
is the sequence of partitions (diagrams) µ = λ(0) ⊂ λ(1) ⊂ · · · ⊂ λ(r) = λ
such that each of the skew diagrams θ (i) = λ(i) − λ(i−1) (1 ≤ i ≤ r) is a
horizontal strip. Graphically, T may be described by the numbering each
square of the skew diagram θ (i) with the number i. The numbers inserted
in λ − µ must increase strictly down each column and weakly from left to
right along each row. The skew diagram λ − µ is called the shape of tableau
T , and the sequence (|θ (1) |, . . . , |θ (r) |) is called the weight of T .
   Let T be a tableau. From T one can derive a word w(T ) by reading the
symbols in T from right to left in successive rows, starting with the top
row. A word w = a1 a2 . . . aN in the symbols 1, 2, . . . , n is said to be a lattice
permutation if for 1 ≤ r ≤ N and 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, the number of occurrences
of i in a1 a2 . . . ar is not less than the number of the occurrences of i + 1.
       1 1 1    For example the word w(T ) for the tableau from the picture
     1 2
   2 3          is 1112132. It is an example of the lattice permutation.

Littlewood-Richardson rule. Let λ, µ, ν be partitions. Then cλµν is zero
unless µ ⊂ λ, ν ⊂ λ, |µ| + |ν| = |λ| and for µ, ν ⊂ λ, |µ| + |ν| = |λ| it is
equal to the number of tableaux T of the shape λ − µ and weight ν such that
w(T ) is a lattice permutation.

Schur functions [17] implies that cλνµ = cλµν .

   Let l be such a big integer that κ(i) + l > 0, κ̃(1) + l > 0 and the shifted
highest weights λ′ = λ + l1r form a partition. Below we use the superscript
prime for the shifted objects.
                       ′
Remark 12. cλνµ = cλν ′ µ′

   The last remark allows us to define the coefficient cλνµ , when one of the
λ, ν, µ is not a partition, by the formula from the remark. Below we suppose
that all weight are shifted and the superscript prime is suppressed.


3.3. Combinatorial proofs. Now we use the Littlewood-Richardson rule
to prove lemmas 1,2,3.

Proof of lemma 1. Every irreducible representation Lµ of GL(m − 1), where
µ ∈ P+ (GL(m − 1)) such that λ1 ≥ µ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ µ2 ≥ λ3 ≥ · · · ≥ µm−1 ≥ λm
is contained at the restriction Lλ |GL(m−1) exactly once ( see e.g.[18] page
186). Applying this statement m − n times to λ = (κ̃(1) − κ(1) )1n + κ(1) 1m
we get the first part of the lemma (e.g. dim W̃κ
                                               ~ = 1).
   Now let us use the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the restriction from
the group K(1) = GL(m) to the group K̃(1) × M = GL(n) × GL(m − n). To
prove the second part of the lemma one must find all partitions ν of length
less or equal n such that cλν,κ 1m−n 6= 0. That is one must find all fillings
                                (1)
of λ \ κ(1) 1m−n by 1, . . . , n such that the result is the tableau satisfying the
lattice permutation condition. The first part of the lemma says that if such
filling exists then it is unique.
    Let us construct this filling. Let us fill the last κ̃(1) − κ(1) squares of the
i-th row (i = 1, . . . , n) by i and the first κ(1) squares of the (m − n + i)-th
row (i = 1, . . . , n) by i. One can check that the resulting tableau satisfies
the lattice permutation condition and has the weight ν = κ̃(1) 1n .
     1 1    For example on the picture we drew the filling corresponding to
   1 2 2
   2        the case m = 3, n = 2, κ̃(1) = 3, κ(2) = 1.
                                                                                 

  To prove lemma 2 we must calculate cλκ(1) 1m ,κ(2) 1n . Let T = {κ(1) 1m =
λ(0) ⊂ · · · ⊂ λ(n) = λ} be a tableau contributing to the Littlewood-
Richardson number cλκ(1) 1m ,κ(2) 1n . Then all the squares in the i-th row are
labeled by i, and the (m + i)-th row may contain only the symbols i, . . . , n
(1 ≤ i ≤ n). Also the horizontal strip condition implies that T can not
contain any label at the (n + j)-th row (j = 1, . . . , m − n). Hence it implies
λn+j = κ(1) . We use following notations for the labeling of the last n rows:
the number of occurrences of the symbol i at the (m + j)-th row is equal to
µij .
                                        18
                         The drawn tableau T corresponds to the case n = 4,
             1 1 1 1
             2 2 2       m = 4, κ(1) = 4, κ(2) = 1. The diagram λ has the
             3          shape: λ = (8, 7, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 1). The labeling of the
             4

   4                     µ44 = 1. The word w(T ) is a lattice permutation.

Lemma 6. If cλκ(1) 1m ,κ(2) 1n 6= 0 then

(17)            λj + λm+n+1−j = κ(1) + κ(2) ,               (j = 1, . . . , n)



(18)                   λn+i = κ(1)             (j = 1, . . . , m − n)



(19)                                     λn ≥ κ(1) .

In this case cλκ(1) 1m ,κ(2) 1n = 1 and the labeling of the corresponding tableau
is given by formula:

(20)                              µij = λi−j − λi−j+1 ,

where i ≥ j and λ0 = κ(1) + κ(2) .

Proof. Let us remark that the reasoning before the lemma proves formula
(18). Hence the n+j-th row (j = 1, . . . , m−n) plays no role and we consider
only the case n = m in the proof.
  We prove the claim by the induction in n.
  For n = 1 the claim is obvious.
                                                                 λ(s+1)
  Let T = {λ(0) ⊂ · · · ⊂ λ(s+1) } be a tableau contributing to cκ   1s+1 ,κ 1s+1(1)   (2)

and T̃ is the tableau obtained from T by deleting the boxes with s + 1.
Tableau T̃ contains only the symbols 1, . . . , s and is of the shape λ̃ \ κ(1) 1s
for partition λ̃, and λ̃i = λi (i = 1, . . . , s). Furthermore, T̃ contributes to the
Littlewood-Richardson number cλ̃κ(1) 1s ,κ(2) 1s . Hence for T̃ (17)-(20) hold by
the induction hypothesis. That is, the numbers µij , s ≥ i ≥ j, for given λ are
uniquely determined by (20) and we only need to find µs+1      j , j = 1, . . . , s + 1.
The horizontal strip condition and the induction hypothesis imply
                        s+1
                        X              s

         µij = λ̃s+j + µs+1

                                                = κ(1) + κ(2) − λs+1−j + µs+1
                                                                          j ,

where λ̃2s = 0. Hence for j = 2, . . . , s + 1 we have
(21)                        λs+2−j ≤ λs+1−j − µs+1
                                               j .
The lattice permutation condition for T implies
(22)                         λs+1 + µs+1
                                       1   ≥ λs .
Adding these s + 1 inequalities, one gets s+1
                                           P           Ps+1 s+1 Ps
                                             j=1 λj +    j=1 µj    ≤ j=0 λj ,
but the weight condition for T implies that the last inequality is an equality.
Hence (21), (22) are also equalities and they imply (20). Thus we proved
that cλκ 1s+1 ,κ 1s+1 6= 0 implies (20) for n = s + 1. One can easily check
        (1)     (2)
that T defined by (20) contributes to the Littlewood-Richardson number
cλκ 1s+1 ,κ 1s+1 .                                                           
  (1)       (2)

   Lemma 6 is equivalent to lemma 2.
   Let us denote by the symbols v and w the partitions v = (κ(1) + κ(2) −
κ̃(1) )1n + κv ne1 , where e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), and w = κ̃(1) 1m + κ(1) 1n .
Lemma 7. If λ is a partition of the length less or equal n + m such that
equalities (17) and inequalities
(23)                                λn ≥ κ̃(1) ,


(24)                             λi − λi+1 ≥ κv ,
where i = 1, . . . , n − 1, hold. Then cλw,v = 1 and the labeling of the corre-
sponding tableau is given by the formulas:
(25)                   µij = λi−j − λi−j+1 , for i ≥ j > 1,


(26)                     µi1 = λi−1 − λi − κv , for i > 1,


(27)                       µ11 = (n − 1)κv + κ(1) − λ1 ,
where λ0 = κ(1) + κ(2) and µij = 0 for i < j.
Proof. Let λ be a partition of the length less or equal m + n, satisfying (25),
(26). Let T be a tableau of the shape λ \ w such that the i-th row is filled by
the symbol i (i = 1, . . . , n) and the (m + j)-th string contains µij symbols i,
where µij are given by formulas (25)-(27). One can check that this tableau
contributes to cλw,v .
                                         20
   Now we will prove that if λ satisfies the conditions from the lemma then
cλw,v = 1, and equations (25)-(27) hold. We will do it by the induction. There
is no difference in reasonings in the case m = n and in the case m > n, and
we consider only the first case. In this case w = κ̃(1) 1n .
   For n = 2 the claim is obvious.
   Now let T = {λ(0) ⊂ · · · ⊂ λ(s+1) = λ} be a skew tableau satisfying
inequalities (23)-(24) for n = s + 1 which contributes to cλ(κ̃ )1s+1 ,v′ , where
                                                                               (1)
v ′ = sκv e1 + (κ(1) + κ(2) − κ̃(1) )1s+1 . Let us remove κv symbols 1 from
the (s + 2)-th row of T , delete the (s + 1)-th and 2(s + 1)-th rows and
all boxes with s + 1 from T . Then one gets a tableau T̃ of some skew
shape λ̃ \ (κ̃(1) )1s , which contributes to the Littlewood-Richardson number
cλ̃(κ̃(1) )1s ,v′′ , v ′′ = κv (s − 1)e1 + (κ(1) + κ(2) − κ̃(1) )1s . Moreover, for T̃
the inequalities (23)-(24) hold, hence by the induction hypothesis equations
(25)-(27) hold for T̃ . Thus we found µji , i ≤ s for T , and we only need to
                                                                j
find µs+1  j . But we know λi , i = 1, . . . , 2(s + 1) and µi , i ≤ s, hence we can
calculate µs+1      j .                                                             

  Remark 12 and lemma 7 imply lemma 3.

3.4. Proof of lemma 4 and the asymptotic estimate.

Proof of lemma 4. Let w ∈ W to be an element of the Weyl group and
                             11 = t(w), θ 33 = t̂(q(w)), here t̂ is the standard
θw ∈ K̃(1) × K(2) such that θw           w
embedding Sn ֒→ GL(n, Z). Then for f ∈ Fκ     ~:

                                                             κ     κ
  f (ea(w(x)) ) = f (θw ea(x) θw−1 ) = θ w f (ea(x) )χ0 (1) χ1 (2) (w)

                = χ0 (1) χ1 (2)                      (w)f (ea(x) )χ0 (1) χ1 (2) (w)
                                                         = χκ0 1 +κ3 χκ1 1 +κ2 +κ3 (w)f (ea(x) ),
here the third equality follows from lemma 1 and the fact that q(w) acts on

Ṽκ
  ~ by det(t̂(q(w)))                          .
   The element e      a(πie j ) belongs to the subgroup K, hence f (ea(x+πiej ) ) =

f (ea(x) ea(πiej ) ) = (−1)κ(1) +κ(2) f (ea(x) ) = (−1)κ1 f (ea(x) ).             

   We can estimate the asymptotic behavior at the infinity of a matrix el-
ement of the representation Lλ . One says that an asymptotic estimate
f (x) . g(x) holds in the sector, x1 > x2 > · · · > xn if for any y from the
                           (ty)
sector the limit limt→+∞ fg(ty) is finite.

Lemma 8. Let v ∈ Lλ , u ∈ L∗λ , then at the sector x1 > x2 > · · · > xn we
have an asymptotic estimate

                   vλ∗
respectively, and hvλ , vλ∗ i = 1.
Proof. We use notations from the subsection 2.1. There is a Cartan subgroup
H ⊂ G, A = exp(p) ∩ H and ea(x) = h(x, 0, −x). The highest weight of Lλ
with respect to H is equal to λ, and all other extremal weights are of the
form w(λ), w ∈ W . Obviously, for proving the claim it is enough to prove the
estimate for the case when u, v are extremalQweight vectors. If u, v are the
extremal weight vectors then hu, ea(x) vi ∼ i=1 e(w(λ)i −w(λ)m+n+1−i )xi , for
x ∼ ∞, and obviously in the sector x1 > · · · > xn the asymptotic estimate
(28) holds.                                                                 

Proof of lemma 5. It is easy to see that all the weight subspaces (with re-
spect to action of T ) of W̃κ    ~ ⊠ Vκ   ~ are one-dimensional. Hence for v ∈

identity zi ± zj = cosh xi cosh xj , one derives from lemma 9 the divisibility of

The right hand side of the last equation is regular at the generic point x such
that δ0,0,1 (x) = 0, hence the left hand side is also regular. Thus f (ea(x) ) is
divisible by δκ1 ,0,κ3 .                                                       
3.6. Proofs of the corollaries.
Proof of corollary 1. If λ = τ (µ + ρ~κ ) then λi − λm+n+1−i = 2(µ + ρ~κ )i . In
the sector x1 > · · · > xn δ~κ , has an asymptotic behavior δ~κ (x) ∼ e2(x,ρ~κ ) .
Hence in this sector the asymptotic estimate Ψµ (x)/δ~κ (x) . e2(x,µ) holds.
Together with lemma 5 it gives the proof of the first item of the corollary.
  The second item immediately follows from the first one. Indeed, if for
some µ ∈ Zn , µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · ≤ µn , λ = τ (µ + ρ~κ ) belongs to P κ   ~ then

Ψµ 6= 0. Hence, by the previous item µ ≥ 0.                                   
Proof of corollary 2. Suppose that dµµ = 0. Then there is an expansion
Ψµ /δ~κ = ν<µ cµν Jν~r . By the definition of the Jack polynomials
           P

                                  X            X
  (Ψµ /δ~κ , L̃~r Ψµ /δ~κ )~r = (   cµν Jν~r ,   (ν + ρ~r , ν + ρ~r )cµν Jν~r )~r
                                ν<µ            ν<µ
         X
     =       (ν + ρ~r , ν + ρ~r )c2µν (Jν~r , Jν~r )~r < (µ + ρ~r , µ + ρ~r )(Ψµ /δ~κ , Ψµ /δ~κ )~r .
         ν<µ

Theorem 1 and formula (5) yields L̃~r Ψµ /δ~r = (µ + ρ~r , µ + ρ~r )Ψµ /δ~r .                           
3.7. Proof of the main theorem.
Proof of theorem 2. Corollary 2, theorem 1 and formula (5) imply the first
item of the theorem.
   The last items follow from the fact that a W -invariant differential operator
is uniquely determined by its action on the space C[P ]W of W -invariant
polynomials (see for example page 16 of [6]). Indeed, formula (6) implies
that the highest term of RC2r has the form described at the theorem. As
C2r are pairwise commutative, hence RC2r are also pairwise commutative.
