1     Introduction

Commutative subalgebras of maximal degree of transcendency (it is known [1] that for com-

mutative associative algebra the degree of transcendency coinsides with Gel’fand- Kirillov

dimension) in the universal enveloping algebras are very important both from the point of

view of the representation theory and the theory of quantization of completely integrable

systems. In the framework of the latter these subalgebras play the role of the algebras of

quantum integrals of motion. In both theories a possibility to diagonalize the generators of

these algebras is very important. It may yield the basis in the space of representation which

consists of common eigenvectors of all generators of these algebras. Examples of such the

construction are known: so-called Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebras consisting of the Casimir ele-

ments of a chain of embedded subalgebras. Bases of their common eigenvectors are celebrated

Gel’fand-Tsetlin bases [2]-[3]. Except for the special case of [4] there were no commutative

subalgebras of the maximal degree of transcendency other than Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebras

known in the universal enveloping algebras of the simple Lie algebras.

    In this paper we find new commutative subalgebras in the universal enveloping algebras

U(g) of the simple Lie algebras g that have maximal degree of transcendency and include any

given commutative subalgebra CgA ⊂ U(gA ) for the next pairs (g, gA ) of Lie algebras and their

subalgebras: (gl(n), gl(n−2) + gl(2)), (so(n), so(n−2) + so(2)) and (sp(n), sp(n−1) + gl(1)).

Idea that lead to the discovery of such the algebras comes out from the theory of integrable

dynamical systems. As it is known [5]- [6] there is sufficiently large (multiparametric) class



                                              2
of commutative with respect to the Lie-Poisson brackets subalgebras in the algebra of the

polinomial functions P (g ∗) on the dual to the Lie algebra space g ∗ . Algebra of polinomial

functions on g ∗ can be viewed as a graded algebra of the filtered algebra U(g) and the

Lie-Poisson brackets as the graded part of the commutator in U(g). Equality to zero of the

Lie-Poisson brackets of the elements of P (g ∗) is equivalent to the equality to zero of the higher

order in the elements of g part of the commutator (but not of the whole commutator!) of the

correspondent elements of U(g). This means that, in general, commutative with respect to

the Lie-Poisson brackets subalgebra in P (g ∗) may not have commutative counterpart in U(g).

But if a commutative subalgebra in P (g ∗) is an algebra of integrals of some dynamical system

of the Euler-Arnold type then from the physical consideration it follows, that corresponding

quantum dynamical system should have the same algebra of the integrals, meaning that

counterpart of commutative algebra in P (g ∗) have also to be commutative subalgebra in

U(g). For the case when underlying dynamics is the dynamics of the generalized rigid body

the corresponding algebra of the integrals coincides with the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra

[5]-[6]. Although it was conjectured by Vinberg [7] that the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra

could be ”lifted” to the universal enveloping algebra without the lost of the commutativity,

he managed to prove this fact only for its special subalgebra, characterized as having a second

order in the elements of the Lie algebra g. We prove (Theorems 1-2) the commutativity in

U(g) of the other analogue of the subalgebra of the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra. Contrary

to the case considered by Vinberg, our subalgebra in the U(g) is not ”homogeneous” in the

elements of g but is linear in the ”parameters of the shift” (A)i,j , i.e. additional parameters

                                                3
which are important ingradients in the definition of the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebras [5]-

[6] 1 . We use it to construct commutative subalgebra in U(g), including its generators, the

Casimir elements of U(g) and generators of a maximally commutative subalgebra in U(gA ),

where gA is a stabilizer of a fixed matrix A in g, in the set of generators of the commutative

subalgebra in U(g). Using results of [9], [10], we prove (Theorem 3) that in the cases when

”shift” matrix A is of the second rank these commutative subalgebras in U(g) have the

maximal degree of transcendency equal to (dimg + indg)/2.

      Importance of these commutative subalgebras is explained by their maximal degree of

transcendency and the fact that they contain the maximal number of generators that com-

mute with the described above Lie subalgebras gA ∈ g. These both facts together mean

that they should separate all vectors of the isomorphic (multiple) representations of the Lie

subalgebra gA that emerge after a restriction of a representation of the Lie algebra g to its

                    2
subalgebra gA .

      The structure of our article is following: in section 2 we prove commutativity of the

described above subalgebras in U(g), in section 3 we prove the maximallity of the degree of

transcendency for the constructed commutative subalgebras, and in the last sections we give

the proofs of the main theorems.

2     Commutativity

Here we will present some commutative subalgebras in the universal enveloping algebra,

that will be used in the next section to construct maximal commutative subalgebras. All

considered algebras in this section are over a field K of characteristic zero.

    2.1 Let us consider the case of gl(n) algebra first. Let Xi,j , i, j ∈ I where I = (1, 2, ..., n),

be the basis in this algebra with the commutation relations:

    [Xi,j , Xk,l ] = δk,j Xi,l − δi,l Xk,j .

    Universal enveloping algebra U(gl(n)) consists of formal polinomials in the elements Xi,j .

Let us define the following elements of U(gl(n)):
                          P
    (X M )i,j =                     Xi,i1 Xi1 ,i2 ...XiM −1 ,j .
                  i1 ,...iM −1 ∈I
                                                                       P
    It is known [8], that the elements: (X M ) =                             (X M )i,i , M ∈ (1, 2, ..., n) generate the
                                                                       i∈I

center of the universal enveloping algebra. For arbitrary numerical matrix A ∈ Mat(n, K)

and positive integer M we can introduce the following elements of U(g):
                   P
    (AX M ) =             Aj,i (X M )i,j .
                  i,j∈I

    They are ”quantum ” analogues of the generators of the subalgebra of the Mishchenko-

Fomenko algebra linear in the ”shift” parameters Aj,i .
                                                                                                           P
    Let gA ⊂ gl(n) be the subspace in g spanned over K by the elements (BX) =                                     Bj,i Xi,j ,
                                                                                                          i,j∈I

where numerical matrix B belongs to the stabilizer of A in Mat(n, K), i. e. [B, A] = 0. It is

easy to show that [(BX), (CX)] = ([B, C]X), i. e. that gA is a subalgebra in g isomorphic

to the stabilizer of matrix A in Mat(n, K).



                                                                   5
   Now we are able to formulate the theorem.

   Theorem 1. Let FA be a subalgebra in U(gl(n)) generated by (X N ) and (AX M ) ,

M, N ∈ Z+ . Then

   (i) FA is a commutative subalgebra in U(gl(n)).

   (ii) gA centralizes FA in gl(n).

   Idea of proof. Proof of the statement (ii) of Theorem 1 is based on the fact that elements

(X M )i,j are tensorial [8] . We prove statement (i) using the fact that higher order in the

elements of gl(n) part of the commutator [(AX M ), (AX N )] is trivial due to the commutativity

of (AX M ) and (AX N ) in P (gl(n)∗), the observation that the other part of the commutator

could be written in the form of the sum of the communators of (AX K ) and (AX L ) where

K < M and the obvious fact that (AX) ∈ gA . See section 4 for detailed proof.

   2.2 In this subsection we consider the case of the algebras so(n) and sp(n) which will be

denoted by g. It will be convenient to treat them uniformly, so that the algebras so(2n) and

sp(n) be considered as subalgebras of gl(2n) and algebra so(2n+1) as a subalgebra of gl(2n+

1) respectively. Let Xi,j , i, j ∈ I be the basis in these algebras, I = (−n, ..., −1, 0, 1, ..., n)

for the case of so(2n + 1), I = (−n, ..., −1, 1, ..., n) for the case of sp(n) and so(2n), with the

commutation relations:

   [Xi,j , Xk,l ] = δk,j Xi,l − δi,l Xk,j + ǫi ǫj (δj,−l Xk,−i − δk,−i X−j,l )

   and additional property Xi,j = −ǫi ǫj X−j,−i (here ǫj = 1 for the case g = so(n) and

ǫj =sgn j for the case g = sp(n)). Universal enveloping algebra U(g) consists of formal

polinomials in the elements Xi,j . Let (X M )i,j , (X M ), (AX M ) be elements of U(g) and

                                                        6
FA ⊂ U(g), gA ⊂ g be subalgebras of U(g) defined like in previous subsection. Then the

following theorem analogous to Theorem 1 holds:

    Theorem 2. If matrix A satisfies condition Ai,j = ±ǫi ǫj A−j,−i then

    (i) FA is a commutative subalgebra in U(g).

    (ii) gA coincides with the centralizer of FA in g.

    Idea of proof. Proof of Theorem 2 is based on the same idea as the proof of Theorem 1

(see the end of the previous subsection). See section 5 for the detailed proof.

    Remark 1. The type of the realization of algebras so(n) and sp(n) used in this section is

not of any importance. For example we could use standard realization of the algebra so(n)

with the basis Xi,j , i, j ∈ (1, 2, ..., n), Xi,j = −Xj,i that satisfies the commutation relations:

[Xi,j , Xk,l ] = δk,j Xi,l − δi,l Xk,j + δj,l Xk,i − δk,i Xj,l .

    Proof of Theorem 2 in this standard realization is the same as in the previous case.

Important in the above construction is the treatment of the so(n)(sp(n)) algebras as subal-

gebras of gl(n)(gl(2n)) that are stable under the action of the involutive automorphism σ.

For elements (AX N ) ∈ U(gl(n)) to remain commutative after the restriction to the universal

enveloping algebra of these subalgebras for arbitrary realization of the automorphism σ, we

have to require equality σ(A) = ±A, which in our case has the form: Ai,j = ±ǫi ǫj A−j,−i .

    Remark 2. If Ai,j = +ǫi ǫj A−j,−i ( σ(A) = −A in general) then ”quantum integrals”

obtained above correspond to the classical integrals of ”normal series” [6]. In the next

sections we will consider only subalgebras constructed with the help of the matrix A, that

satisfies the condition Ai,j = −ǫi ǫj A−j,−i , meaning that numerical matrix A belong to the

                                                          7
same subalgebra of gl(n) as the considered Lie algebra.




3         Maximality

3.1 Algebras FA constructed in the previous section for all classical Lie algebras g obviously

have degrees of transcendency not higher than 2 rank g -1. Nevertheless statement (ii) of

Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 enables us to extend them to the commutative algebras having

maximal degree of transcendency. Indeed, according to this statement we can use in the

construction of maximal commutative subalgebra in U(g) not only generators of FA but also

some commutative subalgebra in U(gA ). In the case of sufficiently singular matrix A we may

hope to find in U(gA ) ”large ” commutative subalgebra, that will ”complete” FA to the one

having maximal degree of transcendency. Indeed, the following theorem is true.

        Theorem 3.          Let g be simple matrix Lie algebra over the field of real or complex

numbers, A ∈ g be a constant semisimple matrix of the second matrix rank, gA and FA be as

in section 2. Let CgA be some commutative subalgebra in U(gA ), F (g, CgA ) be a commutative

subalgebra in U(g) generated by FA and CgA .

                                                                                          3
        If deg.tr. CgA = (dimgA + indgA )/2 then deg.tr. F (g, CgA ) = (dimg + indg)/2.

        Idea of proof. To prove this Theorem we use commutativity of the algebras FA and CgA ,

provided by Theorems 1-2 and the assumption of Theorem 3, and the results of Vinberg [7]

which enables us to consider problem of finding the degree of transcendency of our subalgebra
    3
        The abbreviation deg.tr. means ”the degree of transcendency ”.



                                                       8
in P (g ∗) instead U(g). Hence the problem of finding the degree of transcendency is reduced

to the problem of finding of the number of functionally independent generators of the algebra

F (g, CgA ) in P (g ∗ ). That permits us to use results of [9] about a number of functionally

independent generators of the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra in the case of a singular covector

of the shift and results of [10] concerning their explicit form. See section 6 for detailed proof.

   Remark 1. The condition that numerical matrix A is of matrix rank 2 is essential.

Indeed, if its matrix rank exceeds 2 then from the dimensional considerations follows that

deg.tr.F (g, CgA ) < (dimg + indg)/2 for arbitrary commutative algebra CgA ∈ U(gA ) [10]. On

the contrary, it is possible to show that in the case of matrix A of rank 1 elements (AX N )

are functionally dependent on the Casimir elements of U(g) and U(gA ). So in the last case

they will not contribute to the degree of transcendency of the constructed commutative

subalgebras.

   This theorem enables us to construct the commutative algebras of maximal degree of

transcendency in the universal enveloping algebra of an arbitrary simple Lie algebra. Indeed,

if there is no known commutative subalgebra in U(gA ) with the maximal Gel’fand-Kirillov

dimension, as in the case of g = sp(n), gA = sp(n − 1) + gl(1), we can use the same method

of constructing commutative subalgebras in the universal enveloping algebra for each simple

component of the gA . Repeating this procedure we at last will come to the situation when

all components of stabilizer satisfy conditions of Theorem 3 (for example when they have

rank one as a simple Lie algebras).

   In the general situation in order to obtain ”large” commutative subalgebras in the uni-

                                                9
versal enveloping algebra one can combine ”method of the chain of subalgebras” with the

method of ” the shift of the argument”, or to be more precise, its special case connected

with special singular ”constant covector A”, varying its degree of singularity from 1 (except

the case of symplectic algebra) to 2 for each successive pair of an algebra and its subalgebra

in the chain. In the next subsections we will consider in the detail this construction for all

classical simple (reductive) Lie algebras over the field C of a complex numbers. We will use

the following easily proved

   Lemma 1. Let A ∈ g ⊂ Mat(n, K) be numerical semisimple matrix of the second ma-

trix rank and the basic field K be the field of the complex numbers. If g is one of the classical

simple Lie algebras of the type An , Bn , Cn , Dn then gA will contain simple Lie subalgebra of

the type An−2 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , Dn−1 correspondently.

   3.2 Let us start with the simplest case g = gl(n) ( or, equivalently, g = sl(n)). The next

corollary of Theorem 3 and Lemma 2 holds.

   Corollary 1. Let us consider the chain of subalgebras in gl(n) of the type

   gl(n) ⊃ gl(n − k1 ) ⊃ gl((n − k1 ) − k2 )) ⊃ ... ⊃ gl(1).

   If ki = 1, 2 for any index i, then one can associate with this chain a commutative subalge-

bra of the maximal degree of transcendency (equal to n(n + 1)/2) in U(gl(n)) that consists of

the Casimir elements of the each subalgebra in the chain, and if subalgebra next to gl(i) in the

                                                            N
chain is gl(i − 2), elements of U(gl(n)) of the type (A(i) X(i) ), N < n. Index (i) here means

that X(i) belongs to corresponding subalgebra gl(i), A(i) ∈ Mat(i) is complex semisimple

matrix of the second matrix rank.

                                               10
       Example. Let g = gl(n); semisimple rank two matrix A be of the type A = diag(a1 , a2 , 0, ..., 0),

where ai ∈ C, ai 6= o. Then gA = gl(n − 2) + gl(1) + gl(1), if a1 6= a2 or gA = gl(n − 2) + gl(2)

if a1 = a2 . In both cases we can construct commutative subalgebras in U(gl(n)) with degree

of transcendency equal to n(n + 1)/2. For its independent generators we can take:

       1) n = rank gl(n) independent Casimir elements of type (X k ), k ∈ (1, 2, ..., n).

       2) n − 1 independent elements of U(gl(n)) of the type (AX m ), m ∈ (1, 2, ...n − 1).

       3) (n − 1)(n − 2)/2 generators of the Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra of gl(n − 2).

       In the second case only we can use instead of the Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra of gl(n − 2)

the Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra of gl(n − 2) + gl(2). In this case we have to exclude from the

generators of the whole commutative algebra generators (AX), (AX 2) which would be no

more algebraically independent. In the special case n = 4 such the commutative algebra was

considered by Yao [4] 4 .

       Remark 1. If k1 = 2 and complex semisimple matrix A = A(n) of rank two has two

equal non zero eigenvalues then all commutative subalgebras, constructed in the Corollary

1, centralize Lie subalgebra gA = gl(n) + gl(2).

       Remark 2.     It is interesting to notice that for all commutative subalgebras constructed

in the Corollary 1, number of the generators, that belong to the given filtered component of

the universal enveloping algebra, is fixed and is the same as in the Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra.

       3.3 The case g = so(n) repeats almost completely the case of the gl(n). The following
   4
       In the case considered by Yao additionally to the Casimir elements of gl(4) and Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra

of gl(2) + gl(2) only one Gl(2) × Gl(2) invariant element of U (gl(4)) was needed.




                                                       11
corollary of Theorem 3 and Lemma 1 holds.

   Corollary 2. Let us consider the chain of subalgebras in so(n) of the type

   so(n) ⊃ so(n − k1 ) ⊃ so((n − k1 ) − k2 )) ⊃ ... ⊃ so(2).

   If ki = 1, 2 for any index i, then one can associate with this chain the commutative

subalgebra in U(so(n)) of the maximal degree of transcendency equal to ((n−1)n/2+[n/2])/2,

that consists of the Casimir elements of the each subalgebra in the chain and, if a subalgebra

                                                                                 N
next to so(i) in the chain is so(i − 2), elements of U(so(n)) of the type (A(i) X(i) ), N < n

,N is odd. Here index (i) means that X(i) belongs to the corresponding subalgebra so(i) and

A(i) ∈ so(i) is complex semisimple matrix of the second matrix rank.

   Remark 1. If k1 = 2 then all the commutative subalgebras constructed above centralize

so(n − 2) + so(2).

   Remark 2. Contrary to the case the g = gl(n) commutative subalgebras corresponding

to the different chains of the subalgebras have different number of the generators, belonging

to the given filtered component of the universal enveloping algebra. In particular, if we take

ki = 2, for all indices i, we’ll obtain commutative subalgebra in the universal enveloping

algebra that contains [n/2] linear in elements of so(n) generators. To make comparison

we remind that Gel’fand-Tsetlin algebra for this case has only one generator linear in the

elements of the so(n).

   3.4 The case g = sp(n) differs from the considered above cases of gl(n) and so(n). In

this case neither for sp(n) nor for any of its subalgebra sp(n − k), k ∈ (1, 2, ..., n − 2)

Gel’fand -Tsetlin algebra is of maximal degree of transcendency equal to (n − k)(n − k + 1).

                                              12
That is why our construction gives only one commutative subalgebra in the U(sp(n)) of

the maximal degree of transcendency. This commutative subalgebra will be the extended

Gel’fand -Tsetlin algebra . This is expressed in the following Corollary:

    Corollary 3. Let us consider the following chain of subalgebras in sp(n)

    sp(n) ⊃ sp(n − 1) ⊃ sp(n − 2) ⊃ ... ⊃ sp(1) ⊃ gl(1).

    A commutative subalgebra in U(sp(n)) of the maximal degree of transcendency equal to

n(n + 1), that consists of the Casimir elements of the each subalgebra in the chain and

                                        k
elements of U(sp(n)) of the type (A(i) X(i) ), k is odd, k < 2i, is associated with this chain.

Index (i) means that X(i) belongs to correspondent subalgebra sp(i)and A(i) ∈ sp(i) is complex

semisimple matrix of the second rank.




4     Proof of Theorem 1.

It is easy to verify [8] that elements (X M )i,j are ”tensorial” :

    [Xi,j , (X M )k,l ] = δk,j (X M )i,l − δi,l (X M )k,j .

    This yields the validity of the statement (ii). Indeed, from the tensorial nature of the ele-

ments (X N )i,j follows that [(BX), (AX N )] = ([A, B]X N ) Hence (BX) and (AX N ) commute

if and only if [A, B] = 0, i. e. if (BX) ∈ gA . This proves (ii).

    Now we will prove part (i) of the theorem. It is evident that Casimir elements of the type

(X K ) commute among themselves and with all elements of U(g). So to prove the statement

it is necessary to show that elements of the type (AX M ) and (AX N ) commute. We will use



                                                         13
the following Proposition.
                                                                    P
                                                                    M
   Proposition 1. [(X M )i,j , (X N )k,l ] =                            ((X M +N −S )i,l (X S−1 )k,j −(X S−1 )i,l (X N +M −S )k,j ).
                                                                  S=1

   Proof . Using the Leibnitz rule we obtain
                                       P
                                       M     P

                                       P =1 u,v=1

   Using tensorial nature of the elements (X N )k,l we will obtain the statement of the propo-

sition.

   Now we are able to prove (i). We will use inductive proof. Let us prove that from

[(AX K ), (AX N )] = 0, for all N ∈ Z+ , K < M − 1 follows that [(AX M ), (AX N )] = 0, for all

N ∈ Z+ . This inductive assumption will be proved by the following Proposition:
                                                                    P  P

   Now to prove the theorem it necessary only to show, that [(AX M ), (AX N )] = 0, for all

N ∈ Z+ , and for M = 0, 1. For M = 0 it is evident, because in this case (AX M ) = TrA.

Validity of this when M = 1 follows from the fact, that (AX) ∈ gA . That proves the theorem.




                                                                        14
5       Proof of Theorem 2

Part (ii) of Theorem 2 is proved like this of Theorem 1 (see the previous section). Let

us prove part (i). Like in the case of the previous theorem to prove the statement it is

necessary only to show that elements of the type (AX M ) and (AX N ) commute.We will use

the same inductive proof. It is possible to show [8] that elements (X N )k,l are tensorial:

[Xi,j , (X N )k,l ] = δk,j (X N )i,l − δi,l (X N )k,j + ǫi ǫj (δj,−l (X N )k,−i − δk,−i (X N )−j,l).

    Besides we will need the following proposition:
                                                  MP
                                                   +1
    Proposition 3. (X M +1 )i,j =                       Cp ǫi ǫj (X p )−j,−i ,
                                                  p=0

    where Cp depend on the Casimir elements of the type (X k ), k < p, CM +1 = (−1)M +1 .

                                                                                   0
    Proof . Proof of this proposition is inductive. Obviously,that it is true for Xi,j = δi,j . It

                           1
is true by definition for Xi,j = Xi,j . Let us suppose that it is true also for M = M0 . It is

easy to show that

    (X M0 +1 )i,j = −ǫi ǫk (X M0 )k,j X−k,−i +Tr(id)(X M0 )i,j −ǫi ǫj (X M0 )−j,−i −ǫi ǫj (X M0 )(X 0 )−j,−i.

    So, from the assumption that the statement of proposition is true for M = M0 it follows

that it is true also for M0 + 1. That proves the proposition.

        p=0          S=1

    Proof .Using the Leibnitz rule we obtain that

                                   M    P

                                   S=1 u,v∈I

    Using tensorial nature of elements (X N )k,l we have



                                                                15

       u∈I

   Using Proposition 3 we obtain the statement of the Proposition 4.

   We will prove the theorem if we prove the equality [(AX K ), (AX N )] = 0, for all N, K ∈
                        P

   First summand is identically zero. It is easy to see that after relabelling of the indices in

the second summand j ↔ l we will have it in the form of (i). If we relabell indices i ↔ −l,

                                                                      16

    from which it is easy to see that this summand is identically zero if and only if Ai,j =

±ǫj ǫ−i A−j,−i . Under this condition after relabelling the indices j → l,−l → k, k → −j it is

easy to see that fourth summand coinsides with the second summand in the right-hand-side

of (i). We have proved (i). By analogous direct calculations, using Proposition 3, one can

verify validity of (ii). Now to prove the theorem it remains only to show that

                Aj,i Al,k [Xi,j , (X N )k,l ] = 0, and                    Aj,k Al,i [Xi,j , (X N )k,l ] = 0.
    i,j,k,l∈I                                                 i,j,k,l∈I

    First equality follows from the fact that (AX) ∈ gA . Let us prove the second equality.

Transforming its left-hand-side we obtain
       P                                             P
                Aj,k Al,i [Xi,j , (X N )k,l ] =               Aj,k Al,i ((δk,j (X N )i,l − δi,l (X N )k,j )+
    i,j,k,l∈I                                     i,j,k,l∈I
                                                                     P
    +ǫi ǫj (δj,−l (X N )k,−i − δk,−i (X N )−j,l )) =                         (ǫi ǫ−l Al,i A−l,k (X N )k,−i −
                                                                 i,j,k,l∈I

    −ǫi ǫj Aj,−i Al,i (X N )−j,l ) = (A2 X N ) − (A2 X N ) = 0.

    That completes the proof of the theorem.




6         Proof of Theorem 3.

Taking into account commutativity of the algebras FA and CgA provided by Theorems 1-

2 and the assumption of Theorem 3 we can use the result of Vinberg [7] that the degree

of transcendency of any commutative subalgebra in an associative filtered Lie algebra is

equal to the degree of transcendency of correspondent subalgebra in the associated graded



                                                                     17
algebra. That is why we may consider commutative (with respect to the Poisson brackets )

                              5
subalgebra in P (g ∗)             instead any commutative subalgebra in U(g). Let S M (X) = (X M ) =
    P
               Xi1 ,i2 Xi3 ,i4 ...XiM ,i1 be a Casimir function in P (g ∗ ). We still consider all classical
i1 ,...iM ∈I

simple algebras as a subalgebras in gl(n) and denote coordinate functions on g ∗ by the same

letters as basic elements of g. It is easy to see that commutative subagebra FA (g) coincides

with the subalgebra of the integrals of the degree not higher than one in the parameters of

the shift of the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra. Let us explain its construction. Let A ∈ g ∗ be

any constant covector. Then one can define functions SAk,M (X), k < M from the expansion:
                          P
                          M
S M (X + λA) =                  SAk,M (X)λk . Let F (A, X) be commutative algebra generated by all
                          k=1

functions        SAk,M (X), k     < M, M ∈ Z+ . Following [7] we call it Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra.

We will need the following Lemma:

        Lemma 2. Let Osing be the singular semisimple coadjoint orbit in g ∗ consisting of the

elements of g ∗ of the second matrix rank.Then for independent generators of the Mishchenko-

Fomenko algebra restricted to this orbit could be chosen those ones having degrees not higher

than 2 in the coordinates of g ∗ .

        Sketch of the proof 6 . Let {P M (X)} be a complete set of invariant functions chosen in

the form of coeficients of the characteristic polinomial. Let PAk,M (X), k < M be the set of

”integrals” obtained by the described above procedure of the ”shift of the argument”. It is

easy to show that PAk,M (X) are linear combinations of the minor determinants of the matrix
    5
        One can identify g and g ∗ in the semisimple case.

    6
        For more detailed proof look [10].

X of the order M − k. Hence after restriction to the Osing only those with M − k < 3

(i. e. those of the degree not higher than 2 in the X variables) are not zero. Statement

of the proposition now follows from the fact that {P M (X)} and {S M (X)} and, hence,

{PAk,M (X), k < M} and {SAk,M (X), k < M} are connected by a bipolinomial correspondence.

       We can consider SAk,M (X) as functions depending on the X and A. Let dX (.) denotes

the ”matrix” gradients of functions SAk,M (X) with the values in g. Let dA (.) denotes the

matrix gradients of functions SAk,M (X) considered as functions of parameters A. Functional

independence of functions in P (g ∗) (as functions of X) is equivalent to the linear indepen-

dence of their gradients. Let DX (f )( DA (f )) denotes the space of matrix gradients over

variables X (parameters A) of all generators of some subalgebra f ⊂ F (A, X). There exists

a kind of duality between integrals from the Mishchenko-Fomenko algebra as functions of
                                             M −k−1,M
X and A variables [9]: dX (SAk,M (X)) = dA (SX        (A)), DX (F (A, X)) = DA (F (X, A)).7

From the first equality follows that DX (FA (X)) = DA (FX2 (A)), where FX2 (A) is a subal-

gebra in F (X, A) of the first and the second order in parameters A. From the Lemma 2

follows that DA (FX2 (A)) = DA (F (X, A)). Hence we obtain DX (FA (X)) = DA (F (X, A)) =
                                                                         T
DX (F (A, X)). As it was shown in [9]: dim(DX (F (A, X)) [A, g]) = 1/2dim[A, g]. Hence
                                    T
we obtain: dim(DX (FA (X)) [A, g]) = 1/2dim[A, g]. Taking into account, that [A, g] ⊥ gA ,

dim[A, g]=dimg − dimgA , and indgA = indg = rankg for semisimple matrix A, we obtain the

statement of the theorem.
   7
       Note that in the right-hand-side of these relations Xi,j play the role of the parameters of the shift and

Ai,j play the role of the coordinates of the algebra.
