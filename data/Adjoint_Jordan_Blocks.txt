                                                     field of characteristic p > 0. We suppose that p is very good for G; since p is
                                                     good, there is a bijection between the nilpotent orbits in the Lie algebra and the
                                                     unipotent classes in G. If the nilpotent X ∈ Lie(G) and the unipotent u ∈ G
                                                     correspond under this bijection, and if u has order p, we show that the partitions
                                                     of ad(X) and Ad(u) are the same. When G is classical or of type G2 , we prove
                                                     this result with no assumption on the order of u.
                                                         In the cases where u has order p, the result is achieved through an applica-

                                                     the techniques are more elementary, and they lead also to a new proof of the fol-

                                                 Let G be a quasisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field k of
                                             characteristic p > 0. In case p is good for G, there is a bijection between the nilpotent
                                             orbits in the Lie algebra, and the unipotent classes in G.
                                                 Suppose the class of the unipotent u and the nilpotent X correspond under this
                                             bijection. Assume further that u has order p (or equivalently, that X is p-nilpotent,
                                             i.e. X [p] = 0). We prove in Theorem 10 that if p is very good, the partition of Ad(u) is
                                             the same as the partition of ad(X) (where Ad and ad denote the respective adjoint
                                             actions of G and g = Lie(G) on g). This is carried out in §3.1 using results of Seitz
                                             [S00] on good A1 -type subgroups of G.
                                                 When G is a classical group, or has type G2 , we show in Theorems 24 and 30 that
                                             the partitions of Ad(u) and ad(X) coincide with no assumption on the order of u.
                                             The techniques for classical groups involve comparison of “group like” and “Lie
                                             algebra like” tensor products; see §4. One may consider more generally the tensor
                                             product determined by any 1 dimensional formal group law. In this context, our
                                             techniques provide a new proof of a theorem of Fossum: the representation ring
                                             of a formal group law F is independent of F ; see Corollary 18.
                                                 Lawther [Law95] has found (with the aid of a computer) the adjoint partitions
                                             of the unipotent classes in exceptional simple algebraic groups. Combined with
                                             his work, Theorem 10 computes the adjoint partitions for those nilpotent classes
                                             of exceptional groups in good characteristic which are p-nilpotent.
                                                 In a final section §7, we consider adjoint partitions in characteristic 0. Let G be a
                                             semisimple group of rank r in characteristic 0. We show that for certain nilpotent
                                             elements X, the eigenvalues (on a Cartan subalgebra) of a corresponding Weyl
                                             group element account for r parts of the partition of ad(X).

   At the risk of being pedantic, we recall: The partition of a nilpotent linear en-
domorphism X of a vector space V over a field is the ordered sequence of Jordan
block sizes of X. The partition of a unipotent linear automorphism u of V is the
partition of the nilpotent map u − 1.

                                  2. S IMPLE GROUPS
   Let G be a quasisimple algebraic group over k with Lie algebra g; thus the root
system R of the semisimple group G is irreducible.
2.1. The bad, the good, and the very good. The characteristic p of k is said to be
bad for R in the following circumstances: p = 2 is bad whenever R 6= Ar , p = 3 is
bad if R = G2 , F4 , Er , and p = 5 is bad if R = E8 . Otherwise, p is good.
   Moreover, p is very good if r 6≡ −1 (mod p) in case R = Ar .
2.2. Classical groups. Let V be a finite dimensional vectorspace over k, suppose
that ϕ is a bilinear form on V , let Ω be the full group of isometries of V with respect
to ϕ, and let o = Lie(Ω). We will say that Ω is a classical group in the following
situations:
CG1. ϕ = 0, so that Ω = GL(V ) and o = gl(V ).
CG2. ϕ is nondegenerate and alternating, so that Ω = Sp(V, ϕ) is a symplectic
       group, and o = sp(V, ϕ).
CG3. ϕ is nondegenerate and symmetric, so that Ω = O(V, ϕ) is an orthogonal
       group, and o = so(V, ϕ).
    In each case, Ω is a reductive group (though it is not connected in case CG3, and
it is not semisimple in case CG1). The prime 2 is bad in cases CG2 and CG3; all
other primes are good for classical groups. For convenience, we write (ν, V ) for
the natural representation of Ω.
    We record the following well-known characterization of the adjoint representa-
tion of a classical group Ω.
Lemma 1. There is an isomorphism of Ω-representations
                                     ∨       ∨
                            (ν ⊗ ν , V ⊗ V ) in case CG1,
                                    2       2
                  (Ad, o) ≃ (Sym ν, Sym V ) in case CG2,
                                V2 V2
                                ( ν, V )           in case CG3.
   Here, V ∨ denotes the dual vector space (and ν ∨ the contragredient representa-
tion). We also record:
Lemma 2. Let W be a k-vector space. If the characteristic of k is not 2, there is an iso-
morphism of GL(W )-representations
                                                  V2
                           W ⊗ W ≃ Sym2 W ⊕ W.
2.3. Springer’s isomorphism. Let G be connected, reductive with an irreducible
root system, let N ⊂ g be the nilpotent variety , and let U ⊂ G be the unipo-
tent variety of G. We recall the following result (which depends on Bardsley and
Richardson’s construction of a “Springer isomorphism”).
Proposition 3. If the characteristic of k is very good for G, there is a G-equivariant iso-
morphism θ : N → U with the property θ(X [p] ) = θ(X)p for each X ∈ N .
Proof. [M, Lemma 27, Theorem 35].

2.4. Distinguished nilpotents and associated co-characters. In this paragraph, G
may be an arbitrary reductive group in good characteristic. A nilpotent X ∈ g
is distinguished if the connected center of G is a maximal torus of CG (X). The
Bala-Carter theorem, proved by Pommerening for reductive groups in good char-
acteristic, implies that any nilpotent X ∈ g is distinguished in the Lie algebra of
some Levi subgroup L of G.
    Let X ∈ g be nilpotent. A co-character φ : k × → G is said to be associated to X
if Ad ◦φ(t)X = t2 X for all t ∈ k × , and if the image of φ is contained in the derived
group L′ of a Levi subgroup L such that X is distinguished in Lie(L). The existence
of a co-character associated to a nilpotent X ∈ g follows from Pommerening’s
proof of the Bala-Carter theorem (more precisely: is a key step in his proof of that
                                                                              o
theorem). Any two co-characters associated with X are conjugate via CG          (X); see
e.g. [Jan, Lemma 5.2].
    The following useful observation is a consequence of definitions:
                                                                                     
                                                                                 0 1
Lemma 4. Let φ : SL2/k → G be a homomorphism and suppose that X = dφ(                  )
                                                                                 0 0
                                                                           −1
is a distinguished nilpotent element of G. Then the rule ψ(t) = φ(diag(t, t )) yields a
co-character associated to X.

            3. A DJOINT J ORDAN BLOCKS       FOR ELEMENTS OF ORDER       p
3.1. Partitions and SL2 (k). Let S = SL2 (k), and write S(p) = SL2 (Fp ). The domi-
nant weights of a maximal torus of S may be identified with Z≥0 . To each d ∈ Z≥0 ,
there correspond various S-representations: a simple module L(d), a Weyl module
V (d) (of dimension d + 1), and an indecomposable tilting module T (d); all three
have highest weight d. If d < p, then L(d) = V (d) = T (d). We refer to [Don93]
                        L tilting modules. Note especially that each tilting S-
for more details concerning
module is a direct sum di T (di ) for various di ≥ 0; see [Don93, Theorem 1.1].
Proposition 5. Suppose that p 6= 2, and p ≤ d ≤ 2p − 2.
  1. Each unipotent element 1 6= u ∈ S acts on T (d) with partition (p, p).
  2. Each nilpotent element 0 6= X ∈ Lie(S) = sl2 (k) acts on T (d) with partition
     (p, p).
Proof. By [S00, Lemma 2.3], the S(p)-module resSS(p) T (d) is projective of dimen-
sion 2p. If U (p) < S(p) is the subgroup generated by some element of order p, it
follows that resSU(p) T (d) is free of rank 2 over kU (p). Now (1) is immediate, since
u is S-conjugate to an element in U (p).
   The Lie algebra case is essentially the same argument. Write s = Lie(S). One
then knows that T (d) is a direct summand of L(r + 1) ⊗ L(p − 1), where d = r + p.
Since the Steinberg module L(p − 1) is projective as a module for the restricted en-
veloping algebra of s [Jan87, Prop. II.10.2], the same holds for T (d). Put u = kX ⊂
s; together with [Jan98, Cor. 3.4], the above shows that T (d) is free of rank two
over Λ, the restricted enveloping algebra of u. Since Λ is a truncated polynomial
algebra, X must act with the indicated partition.

   Let u, X as in the previous proposition. On a simple module L(d) = T (d) with
d < p, both u and X act as a single Jordan block. We thus obtain:
4                                    GEORGE MCNINCH


Corollary 6. Let (ρ, V ) be a tilting module for S such that each weight d of a maximal
torus of S on V satisfies d ≤ 2p − 2. If 1 6= u ∈ S is unipotent and 0 6= X ∈ Lie(S) is
nilpotent, then the partition of ρ(u) is the same as the partition of dρ(X).
3.2. Some results on classical groups. Let Ω = Ω(V ) be a classical group in good
characteristic (§2.2).
Proposition 7. Let u ∈ Ω be a unipotent element of order p, and let λ = (λi )1≤i≤t be the
partition of u. There is a unique Ω-conjugacy class of homomorphisms ψ : SL2 (k) → Ω
with the following properties:
   1. The image of ψ meets the conjugacy class of u.
   2. The character of the SL2 (k)-module (ν ◦ ψ, V ) is
                       χ(λ1 − 1) + χ(λ2 − 1) + · · · + χ(λt − 1).
Proof. For existence of such a ψ, see [S00, Prop. 4.1]. To see that any two such
homomorphisms are conjugate, see the proof of [S00, Prop. 7.1].

Proposition 8. Let ψ : SL2 (k) → Ω be a homomorphism satisfying (1) and (2) of Propo-
sition 7. Then (Ad ◦ψ, o) is a tilting module for SL2 (k). Moreover, each weight d of this
representation satisfies d ≤ 2p − 2.
Proof. Since the tensor product of tilting modules is again a tilting module [Don93,
Prop. 1.2], and since each weight e of (ν ◦ ψ, V ) satisfies e ≤ p − 1, Lemmas 1 and
2 yield the result.
   Let X ∈ o be nilpotent, and let λX be the partition of X (recall that for classical
groups, the nilpotent and unipotent classes are classified by their partitions; see
e.g. [Hum95, §7.11] or [Jan, Theorem 1.6] for a description of those λ which may
arise as λX ). As in §2.4, let φ be a co-character associated with X. In fact, the
existence of such a φ is quite easy to prove for a classical group; see [Jan, §3.5].
Proposition 9. Let X ∈ o be nilpotent with partition λ = (λi ). Suppose that λi ≤ p for
each i. Let ψ : SL2 (k) → Ω be a homomorphism such that X is in the image of dψ, and
such that the restriction of ψ to a maximal torus of SL2 (k) is a co-character associated to
X. Then ψ satisfies (1) and (2) of Proposition 7 for the unipotent class with partition λ.
Proof. The explicit recipe [Jan, §3.5] for a co-character associated to X implies that
the character of the SL2 (k)-representation (Ad ◦ψ, o) is as in (2) of Proposition 7.
For condition (1), it suffices to observe that (Ad ◦ψ, o) is a restricted, semisimple
representation of SL2 (k) (by the linkage principle), so that a unipotent element in
the image of ψ indeed acts with the partition λ.
3.3. The main result for unipotent elements of order p. Let G be quasisimple in
very good characteristic, and let θ : N → U be a G-equivariant homeomorphism
as in Proposition 3. Suppose that u = θ(X), and that up = 1. According to Propo-
sition 3, this is equivalent to X [p] = 0.
Theorem 10. The partition of Ad u is the same as that of ad X.
   Before giving the proof, we note the following lemmas which provide a helpful
reduction in case the root system of G is classical.
Lemma 11. Let π : G → Gad be the isogeny to the adjoint group. The partition of
Ad(u) is the same as that of Ad(π(u)), and the partition of ad(X) is the same as that of
ad(dπ(X)).

Proof. Since p is very good, dπ is a bijection and the result is clear.

Lemma 12. Suppose that the root system R of G is classical (A, B, C or D), that the
characteristic is very good for G, and that G is of adjoint type. There is a classical group
Ω (§2.2), an Ad(Ω) invariant decomposition o = o1 ⊕ o2 , a unipotent u′ ∈ Ω, and a
nilpotent X ′ ∈ o such that
   1.   u′ and X ′ correspond under a Springer isomorphism (Propoosition 3) for Ωo ,
   2.   the partition of Ad(u) coincides with that of Ad(u′ )|o1 ,
   3.   the partition of ad(X) coincides with that of ad(X ′ )|o1 ,
   4.   o2 is either zero, or Ad(Ω) acts trivially on it.
Proof. By the previous lemma, we may replace G be the corresponding adjoint
group. Since G has a “classical type” root system, it is well known that G is a
quotient of a classical group Ω by a central subgroup. It suffices to find a de-
composition o = o1 ⊕ o2 such that the quotient map dπ induces an Ω-equivariant
isomorphism o1 ≃ g, and such that o2 is 0 or a trivial module. Indeed, [M, Prop.
26] then shows that dπ will also induce Ω-equivariant isomorphisms between the
nilpotent variety of o and that of g, and that π will induce an isomorphism between
the unipotent variety of Ω and that of G, and the lemma will follow.
   When R = B, C or D, the map π is an isogeny, and since o = o1 and g are simple
representations, dπ induces an isomorphism on Lie algebras.
   When R = Ar , we may take Ω = GLr+1 (k) and our hypothesis shows that p
does not divide r + 1. Set o1 = slr+1 (k) and let o2 be the space spanned by the
identity matrix. Then o = o1 ⊕ o2 is an Ω-stable decomposition, and Ω acts trivially
on o2 . Moreover, o1 and g are simple modules, so dπ induces an isomorphism
o1 ≃ g, which completes the proof of the lemma.

Proof of Theorem 10. Fix u ∈ G unipotent of order p. Let φ : SL2 (k) → G be a
homomorphism whose image contains u and is a good A1 subgroup, in the sense
of [S00]; this means that the weights of the SL2 (k)-module (Ad ◦φ, g) are all ≤ 2p−2
(the existence of such a φ is proved in loc. cit.). It follows from Theorem 1.1 of loc.
cit. that (Ad ◦φ, g) is a tilting module for SL2 (k) (recall that we suppose p to be very
good so that the exceptional situation in loc. cit. does not occur).
    Now let ψ : SL2 (k) → G be a “sub-principal” homomorphism, as constructed
in [M], whose image contains u. Write u = θ(X) for X ∈ N . Then [M, Theorem 12]
shows that the image of dψ meets the nilpotent orbit containing X. So Theorem 10
will follow from Corollary 6 once we show that ψ is conjugate to φ. According to
[S00, Prop. 7.2], all good A1 -subgroups meeting the class of u are conjugate in G.
So we are reduced to proving that the image of ψ is a good A1 -subgroup.
    By [M, Theorem 2], one knows that the weights of (Ad ◦ψ, g) are determined
by the labeled Dynkin diagram of u. When G has an exceptional-type root system
(E,F, or G) it follows from the proof of [S00, Prop. 4.2] that those weights are
≤ 2p − 2, so that the image of ψ is indeed a good A1 -subgroup.
    When G has a classical-type root system (A, B, C, or D), we may suppose, ac-
cording to the previous lemma, that G is a classical group. By [M, Theorem 2], the
restriction of ψ to a maximal torus of SL2 (k) is a co-character associated to a conju-
gate of X. Thus Proposition 9 implies that ψ satisfies the conditions of Proposition
7 for u. Then Proposition 8 shows that the image of ψ is a good A1 subgroup, as
desired.

connected, quasisimple group. If G has a classical-type root system, we suppose
that the characteristic is very good for G. If G has an exceptional-type root system
R, we suppose that p > N where N = 3, 3, 5, 7, 7 when R = G2 , F4 , E6 , E7 , E8
respectively.
Theorem 13. Let X ∈ g be a distinguished nilpotent element. There is a unique G-
conjugacy class of homomorphisms φ : SL2 (k) → G such that the image of dφ meets the
orbit of X. For any such φ, the image of φ meets the unipotent class containing θ(X),
where θ is an equivariant isomorphism as in Proposition 3.
Proof. That there is at least one such φ follows from [M, Theorem 12]; moreover it
follows from loc. cit. that the image of φ meets the class of θ(X), so the last asser-
tion of the theorem will followfrom   conjugacy. If φ is any such homomorphism,
                                   0 1
we may suppose that X = dφ               . Since X is distinguished, it follows from
                                   0 0
Lemma 4 that ν(t) = φ(diag(t, 1/t)) : k × → G is a co-character associated to X.
   Suppose first that G has a classical root system. Since any central extension of
SL2 (k) is split, we may replace G by the corresponding adjoint group, as in Lemma
11. As in the proof of Lemma 12, we may therefore suppose that G = Ω = Ω(V )
is a classical group. In this case, the existence of at least one φ follows also from
Proposition 7 (this is more elementary than [M]). The remaining assertions follow
from Proposition 9.
   Now supose that G has an exceptional root system. Improving on a result of
Liebeck–Seitz, Lawther and Testerman prove under our assumptions on p that φ is
determined up to G-conjugacy by ν; see [LT99, §2 and Theorem 4]. This completes
the proof.

Remark 14. There are of course homomorphisms φ : SL2 (k) → G whose image
meets a distinguished unipotent class, but for which dφ fails to meet the corre-
sponding nilpotent class. To give an example, recall for 0 ≤ m < p that the
SL2 (k)-module L(m) carries an invariant non-degenerate bilinear form βn which
is alternating when m is odd, and symmetric when m is even. Now, suppose
that p > 2n > 0, and consider the SL2 (k)-module W = L(2n) ⊗ L(1)[1] (where
the exponent in the second factor denotes a Frobenius twist). The tensor product
β = β2n ⊗ β1 is an invariant alternating form on W . If ρ : SL2 (k) → Sp(W, β)
is the defining homomorphism, then the image of ρ meets the     (distinguished)
                                                                     
                                                                0 1
unipotent class with partition (2n + 2, 2n) on W , but X = dρ          has parti-
                                                                0 0
tion (2n + 1, 2n + 1). Note that X is not distinguished.

              4. F ORMAL    GROUPS AND NILPOTENT ENDOMORPHISMS

    Fix in this section an arbitrary field k.

4.1. Similar nilpotent endomorphisms. Denote by C the category whose objects
are pairs (V, φ) where V is a (finite dimensional) k-vector space and φ is a nilpotent
k-endomorphism; a morphism f : (V, φ) → (W, ψ) in C is a linear map which
intertwines φ and ψ.
   We begin with the simple observation
                                  ADJOINT JORDAN BLOCKS                                      7


Lemma 15. Let f ∈ tk[[t]]\t2k[[t]]. For each (V, φ) in C , there is an isomorphism (V, φ) ≃
(V, f (φ)).
Proof. Since any subspace invariant by φ is also invariant by f (φ), we may suppose
that φ acts as a single Jordan block. We identify (V, φ) with (k[t]/(tn ), µt ) where µt
is multiplication by (the image of) t, so we must find a linear automorphism Λ of
k[t]/(tn ) with Λ ◦ µt = µf (t) ◦ Λ.
   It is well known that f has a “compositional inverse”; i.e. a series g ∈ tk[[t]]
with f (g(t)) = t and g(f (t)) = t. It follows that the algebra homomorphism Λ :
k[t]/(tn ) → k[t]/(tn ) satisfying t 7→ f (t) is an automorphism. Since Λ clearly
intertwines µt and µf (t) , the proof is complete.

  Now suppose that Y1 , . . . , Ym are indeterminants, and put A = k[[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]].
For an m-tuple of positive integers ~r = (r1 , . . . , rm ), put
                                 A~r = A/(Y1r1 , . . . , Ymrm ).
If ξ1 , . . . , ξr ∈ k × and f1 , . . . , fr are formal series without constant term, there is
a uniquely determined continuous algebra homomorphism Λ : A → A satisfying
Λ(Yi ) = Yi (ξi + fi ). Evidently Λ induces an algebra homomorphism Λ~r : A~r → A~r .
Proposition 16. Λ and Λ~r are algebra automorphisms.
Proof. Giving A the (Y1 , . . . , Ym )-adic filtration, the associated graded ring gr A
identifies with A, and gr Λ is given by yi 7→ ξi yi , hence is an automorphism. Since
A is complete and Hausdorff in the (Y1 , . . . , Ym )-adic topology, [Ser00, II.A.4 Prop
6] shows that Λ is surjective. It follows that Λ~r is surjective; since A~r is finite
dimensional, Λ~r is an automorphism. If f ∈ ker Λ, the image of f in A~r is 0 for
each ~r; thus f = 0 and the proposition follows.

Theorem 17. Let F (u, v) ∈ k[[u, v]] satisfy F (u, v) ≡ ξ1 u + ξ2 v (mod (u, v)2 ) with
ξ1 , ξ2 ∈ k × , and suppose that (V, φ) and (W, ψ) are objects in C . Then there is an
isomorphism in C
                 (V ⊗ W, φ ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ψ) ≃ (V ⊗ W, F (φ ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ ψ)).
Proof. Write X = φ ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ψ and X ′ = F (φ ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ ψ); we must show that X
and X ′ are conjugate by the adjoint action of GL(V ⊗ W ). If V = V1 ⊕ V2 with each
Vi invariant by φ, then Vi ⊗ W is invariant by both X and X ′ for i = 1, 2. So we
may suppose that φ (and also ψ) acts as a single Jordan block. We identify (V, φ)
with (k[Y ]/(Y n ), µy ) and (W, ψ) with (k[Z]/(Z m ), µz ), where we write y and z for
the images of Y and Z in the quotient algebras.
   We must find a linear automorphism Λ of
                   B = k[Y ]/(Y n ) ⊗ k[Z]/(Z m ) = k[Y, Z]/(Y n , Z m )
satisfying Λ ◦ (µy+z ) = µF (y,z) ◦ Λ.
    Choose formal series H1 (u, v), H2 (u, v) ∈ uk[[u, v]] + vk[[u, v]] such that F (u, v) =
ξ1 u + ξ2 v + H1 (u, v)u + H2 (u, v)v [in general, H1 and H2 are not uniquely deter-
mined by this condition]. Then according to Proposition 16, there is an algebra
automorphism Λ : B → B satisfying Λ(y) = f1 (y, z) and Λ(z) = f2 (y, z) where
           f1 (Y, Z) = Y (ξ1 + H1 (Y, Z)) and f2 (Y, Z) = Z(ξ2 + H2 (Y, Z)).
8                                    GEORGE MCNINCH


    Since

    Λ(y + z) = f1 (y, z) + f2 (y, z) = ξ1 y + ξ2 z + yH1 (y, z) + zH2 (y, z) = F (y, z),
Λ intertwines µy+z and µF (y,z) as desired.
4.2. Formal groups. A formal group law over k is a series F (u, v) ∈ k[[u, v]] sat-
isfying F (u, v) ≡ u + v (mod (u, v)2 ) and certain other axioms that are written
down in a number of places, se e.g. [Haz78]. Note that F (u, v) is automatically
commutative; see [Haz78, Theorem I,1.6.7].
   The representation ring RF of F introduced in [Fos89] is first of all the Abelian
group generated by symbols [M ] for each object M in C subject to relations as
follows: [M ] and [N ] are identified if M ≃ N . The addition is given by the direct
sum in C :
                         [(V, φ)] + [(W, ψ)] = [(V ⊕ W, φ ⊕ ψ)].
The tensor product (with respect to F ) of two objects in C is defined by
(4.1)               (V, φ) ⊗F (W, ψ) = (V ⊗ W, F (φ ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ ψ)).
The product in RF is defined by [(V, φ)] · [(W, ψ)] = [(V, φ) ⊗F (W, ψ)]; the axioms
of a formal group imply that RF is indeed a ring.
    Let Jn denote the class in RF obtained from the object (k n , φn ) where φn is a
single n × n Jordan block. The Jn form a Z-basis for RF , and the multiplication
in RF is completely determined by the structure constants ain,m for the products
               P
[Jn ] · [Jm ] = i ain,m [Ji ] for each n, m ≥ 0.
    Now suppose that k has characteristic p > 0. For each n ≥ 1, the full subcate-
                                                         n
gory of C consisting of those objects (V, φ) such that φp = 0 (pn -nilpotent objects)
is closed under the tensor product (4.1) for any formal group F .
    Let C be a cyclic group of order pn with generator g. The category of kC mod-
ules is then equivalent to the pn -nilpotent subcategory; the C-module V corre-
sponds to the object (V, g − 1) of C . The usual tensor product for group repre-
sentations corresponds to the tensor product (4.1) with respect to the multiplicative
formal group law Fm = u + v + uv.
                                             Pn−1    i
    Let wn be the Abelian p-Lie algebra i=0 kX [p ] (with the indicated p-power
map). The category of restricted wn -representations is equivalent to the pn -nilpotent
subcategory. The usual tensor product of Lie algebra representations corresponds
to the tensor product (4.1) with respect to the additive formal group law Fa =
u + v.
Corollary 18 (Fossum). Let F1 and F2 be any two formal group laws over k. The
structure constants for the representation rings RF1 and RF2 are the same.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 17.
   In characteristic 0, all 1-dimensional formal group laws are isomorphic (see
[Haz78, Theorem 1.6.2]) so one has in that case a simple proof of the corollary.
The structure constants in characteristic 0 are the “Clebsch-Gordan” coefficients;
see [Sri64, (2.3)]. In characteristic p > 0, there are non-isomorphic formal group
laws; for instance, Fa 6≃ Fm .
   The representation ring of the multiplicative law Fm has been studied by J. A.
Green in [Gre62] and B. Srinivasan in [Sri64]; see also the references in [Fos89].

Green computed enough of the structure constants to show that RFm ⊗Z C is a
semisimple algebra. Srinivasan determined the structure constants of RFm explic-
itly.
    The above corollary was proved by Fossum in [Fos89, III]. He showed that
the eight formulas obtained by Green in [Gre62] hold for any formal group law;
the corollary follows since those formulas determine the multiplication in RF
uniquely. This proof is in the spirit of “modular representation theory”; it exploits
the fact that (k q , φq ) is a projective object in a suitable subcategory of C when
q = pm .

4.3. A result on symmetric series. Let Σm be the symmetric group on m letters.
Fix Y1 , . . . , Ym indeterminants (each given degree 1), and consider the graded al-
gebras A = k[Y1 , . . . , Ym ] and Â = k[[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]].
   The rule σ(Yi ) = Yσ−1 (i) for σ ∈ Σm defines representations of Σm by graded
algebra automorphisms on A and by continuous graded algebra automorphisms
on Â. We use the notations AΣm and ÂΣm for the subalgebras of invariants. Ad
                                                                            L
and Âd denote the respective d-th homogeneous components, A≥d is e≥d Ae ,
and Â≥d is the ideal of Â generated by A≥d (the d-th power of the unique maximal
ideal of Â).
Lemma 19. Suppose that m! is invertible in k. Let H ∈ AΣ
                                                       d
                                                         m
                                                           be a homogeneous
                                                                  P         invari-
ant. Then there are elements Hi ∈ Ad for 1 ≤ i ≤ m such that H = i Hi , Yi divides
Hi , and σHi = Hσ−1 (i) for each σ ∈ Σm .

Proof. Observe that if H ′ , H ′′ ∈ AΣd
                                        m
                                          and the conclusion of the lemma holds for H ′
and H , then it holds for H + H . Similarly, if H ′ ∈ AΣ
       ′′                        ′     ′′
                                                             d
                                                               m
                                                                  and the conclusion of
the lemma holds for H , then it holds for H · H for any H ′′ ∈ AΣ
                           ′                    ′    ′′
                                                                       e .
                                                                        m

   Since AΣm is a polynomial algebra in the elementary symmetric polynomials
sj ∈ Aj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, we may therefore
                                    Q      suppose H = sj . Thus we fix 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
   For I ⊆ {1, · · · , m}, let YI = k∈I Yk . For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we define
                                                X
                                   Hi = (1/j)           YI ;
                                             |I|=j, i∈I

note that j is invertible
                        Pin k by assumption. Evidently Yi divides HQi . It is a simple
matter to verify that m       H
                          i=1 i  =  s j . Let σ ∈ Σ m . Since σYI =    k∈I Yσ−1 (k) , it
follows that σHi = Hσ−1 (i) .


Proposition 20. Suppose that m! is invertible in k and that f ∈ ÂΣm satisfies f ≡
Y1 + · · · + Ym (mod Â≥2 ) with ξ ∈ k × . Then we may find series fi ∈ Â for 1 ≤ i ≤ m
such that
  1.   fi ≡ Yi (mod Â≥2 ),
  2.   Yi | fi ,
  3.   σfi = fσ−1 (i) for all σ ∈ Σm .
  4.   f = f1 + · · · + fm .
Proof. Since Σm acts by graded algebra automorphisms, f is invariant if and only
if its homogeneous components are. So the proposition follows from the previous
lemma.

4.4. Exterior and symmetric powers in CF . Let F (u, v) be a formal group law as
before. Let Y1 , Y2 , . . . be indeterminants, and put

     N1                     Nm                            N
        F (Y1 )   = Y1 ,      F (Y1 , . . . , Ym )   = F ( m−1
                                                            F  (Y1 , . . . , Ym−1 ), Ym ),        m ≥ 2.
                           N2
Thus F (Y1 , Y2 ) =      F (Y1 , Y2 ),, and if (V, φ) is
                                                       Nan                , the m-fold power
                                                              object of C N
                                                         m                   m
of (V, φ) for the tensor product (4.1) is (V ⊗m , F (φ)), where F (φ) is obtained
      Nm
from F (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) by specializing Yi 7→ 1⊗(i−1) ⊗ φ ⊗ 1⊗(m−i) .
   Recall that Fa (u, v) = u + v denotes the additive formal group law. We have
for each m ≥ 1:
                           Nm
                             Fa (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) = Y1 + · · · + Ym .
For any F (u, v) we have
           Nm
              F (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) ≡ Y1 + · · · + Ym            (mod k[[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]]≥2 ).
     There is a linear representation of the symmetric group Σm on V ⊗m given by
(4.2)                       σ(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vm ) = vσ−1 (1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vσ−1 (m)
for σ ∈ ΣmVand vi ∈ V , 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Any map X ∈ EndΣm (V ⊗m ) induces maps
              m
X ′ ∈ End(      V ) and X ′′ ∈ End(Symm V ).
    Since any 1-dimensional formal group law F (u, v) is commutative, we have
                          Nm                                             Σm
                            F (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) ∈ k[[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]]    .
                 Nm
        V that F (φ) is a Σm -homomorphism
It follows                                   Vm              and hence induces an endomor-
phism m   F (φ) of  the exterior power           V and   an    endomorphism SymmF (φ) of the
                          m
symmetric power Sym V .
Theorem 21. Let F be a formal group law, and (V, φ) an object in C . Assume that
m ≥ 1 is an integer such that m! is non-zero in k. Then there are isomorphisms in C
                           Vm Vm               Vm Vm
                          (    V, Fa (φ)) ≃ (       V, F (φ))
and
                           (Symm V, Symm             m      m
                                       Fa (φ)) ≃ (Sym V, SymF (φ)),

where Fa = u + v is the additive formal group law.
Proof. If V = W ⊕ W ′ where W and W ′ are proper subspaces invariant by φ, one
has the decomposition
                         Vm      M Vi         Vj
                            V =          W ⊗ W′
                                               i+j=m
                                             Vm
                                             Vm
into subspaces invariant by both F (φ) and Fa (φ).
              Vi      Vj ′                           Vm
   Let Wi,j = W ⊗ W with i + j = m. On Wi,j , F (φ) acts as
                              Vi              Vj
                           F ( F (φ) ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ F (φ)),
                                    Vi                 Vj
which by Theorem 17 is similar to F (φ) ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ F (φ). If the result were

We deduce that if the theorem is known for W and W ′ , then it holds for V . Similar
remarks hold for the symmetric powers. Thus, we may suppose that φ acts as a
single Jordan block on V .

   Let B = k[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]/(Y1n , . . . ,N

ageN of Yi in B, we identify (V            , F (φ)) with (B,Nµ)    where µ is multiplication

by F (y1 , . . . , ym ). Similarly, we identify (V ⊗m , F (φ)) with (B, µ′ ) where µ′
is multiplication by y1 + · · · + ym . These identification are isomorphisms of Σm
representations, where Σm acts on V ⊗m as in (4.2), and on B by the action induced
from that on the polynomial algebra.
   The theorem will follow       Nmif we find a kΣm -linear automorphism Λ of B such
that Λ ◦ µ = µ′ ◦ Λ. Since F (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) ∈ k[[Y1 , . . . , Ym ]] satisfies the hypothesis
of Proposition 20, we may find power series f1 , . . . , fm satisfying conditions 1-4 of
that Proposition. In view of conditions 1 and 2, Proposition 16 implies that the rule
Λ(yi ) = fi (y1 , . . . , ym ) defines an algebra automorphism of B. Property 3 implies
that Λ intertwines the Σm action. Finally, property 4 implies that Λ intertwines µ
and µ′ . This completes the proof of the theorem.

Example 22. In [Fos89], it is proved that the classes of

                   (    V, F (φ)) and (Symm V, Symm      F (φ))

in the representation ring are independent of F provided φp = 0, if p is the charac-
teristic of k. Theorem 21 shows that these classes are independent of F provided
that p > m (or p = 0 of course).
   To see that some hypothesis on the characteristic is essential, suppose that p = 2.

   Let Ω = Ω(V ) be a classical group in good characteristic (see §2.2).
Proposition 23. There is a series ε(t) ∈ tk[[t]] \ t2 k[[t]] such that X 7→ 1 + ε(X) defines
a Ω-equivariant isomorphism of varieties N → U.
Proof. See [Hum95, §6.20].
   Note that we identify N and U with subvarieties of Endk (V ). In case CG1, any
series ε(t) ∈ tk[[t]] \ t2 k[[t]] defines an isomorphism as in the proposition. In cases
CG2, CG3, one may take the Cayley transform series

This follows from [M02, 7.4]; see also [Pro01].

Theorem 24. Let θ : N → U be an Ω-equivariant isomorphism of varieties. Then
Ad(θ(X)) and ad(X) have the same partition.
Proof. We may suppose that θ is determined by a formal series ε as in the previous
proposition. Using the identifications of the adjoint modules in Lemma 1, the
action of ad(X) is determined by the additive formal group law Fa . We have:
                                            ∨
                            X ⊗V1 + 1 ⊗ X

                                    2
                    ad(X) =         Fa (X)       in case CG2
                            
                                     2
                                 SymFa (X)       in case CG3.
     Similarly, we have
                          
                          (1 + ε(X))
                                     ⊗ (1 + ε(X ∨ )) in case CG1
                                    V2
               Ad(θ(X)) =       1 + Fm (ε(X))         in case CG2
                          
                                      2
                               1 + SymFm (ε(X))       in case CG3.
By Lemma 15, Ad(θ(X)) is similar to
                          (1 + X) ⊗ (1 + X ∨ )   in case CG1,
                                V2
                             1 + Fm (X)        in case CG2, and
                            1 + Sym2Fm (X)       in case CG3.
The result now follows from Theorem 17 and Theorem 21.

Remark 25. In bad characteristic, the adjoint partition of the regular nilpotent class
can already differ from that of the regular unipotent class. Let p = 2 and let Ω be
the symplectic group Sp2n (k). If u ∈ G is a regular unipotent element, and X ∈ o
is a regular nilpotent element, them from example 22 one obtains the following
partitions:
                     n     partition of Ad(u) partition of ad(X)
                     2     (42 , 2)           (42 , 12 )
                     3     (83 , 4)           (82 , 2, 13 )
Note that the dimensions of ker(Ad(u) − 1) and ker ad(X) agree with the tables in
[Hes79, p. 179].
   If again p = 2, Ω is the orthogonal group O7 (k), and u, X are regular, then the
same example shows that the partition of Ad(u) is (82 , 5) while that of ad(X) is
(73 ).

                          6. A DJOINT J ORDAN   BLOCKS FOR   G2
   In this section, we consider a group G with root system of type G2 . Denote
by ̟1 , ̟2 the fundamental dominant weights in the character group of a fixed
maximal torus T of G with respect to a choice of simple roots α1 , α2 , where α1 is
short. Suppose that p > 3.
   Since p 6= 2, the Weyl module V = V (̟1 ) for G is irreducible of dimension 7.
Moreover, G leaves invariant a non-degenerate quadratic form on V ; this defines
a closed embedding ρ : G → H = SO(V ). Recall that H has a root system of type
B3 .

6.1. Simple root vectors and root subgroups. Fix non-zero elements xαi ∈ gαi ,
i = 1, 2.
Lemma 26. For suitable choices of a maximal torus of H containing T and a system γi
(i = 1, 2, 3) of simple roots for H, we have
   1. dρ(xα1 ) = yγ1 + yγ3 ∈ hγ1 + hγ3
   2. dρ(xα2 ) = yγ2 ∈ hγ2
with yγi 6= 0 for i = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. The weights of the G-module V are ±f1 , ±f2 , ±f3 and 0, where f1 = ̟1 ,
f2 = ̟1 − α1 , and f3 = ̟1 − α1 − α2 .
   Since V is a simple, restricted G-module, a theorem of Curtis implies that it is
also simple as a g-module. Let n be the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of
the Borel sub-group of G corresponding to our choice of positive roots. Since V is
simple for g, we must have V n = Vf1 . Since n is generated as a Lie algebra by xα1
and xα2 , it follows that for any weight γ 6= f1 of V , the restriction of either xα1 or
xα2 to Vλ is non-zero.
   Thus, we see that
(6.1)    xα1 Vf2 = Vf1 ,   xα1 V0 = Vf3 ,    xα1 V−f3 = V0 ,   xα1 V−f1 = V−f2
and xα1 acts trivially on all other weight spaces of V . Similarly,
(6.2)                      xα2 Vf3 = Vf2 ,   xα2 V−f2 = V−f3 .
and xα2 acts trivially on all other weight spaces of V .
   Choose a non-zero weight vector e±i ∈ V±fi and e0 ∈ V0 ; this yields a basis
of V . Since T -weight spaces Vλ and Vµ are orthogonal under the invariant form
unless λ + µ = 0, it follows from [Bor91, §23.4] that the subgroup S of H which
acts diagonally in this basis is a maximal torus (containing T ). If εi ∈ X ∗ (S) is
the S-weight of ei , then the ε1 , ε2 , ε3 form a Z-basis for X ∗ (S). Moreover, γ1 =
ε1 − ε2 , γ2 = ε2 − ε3 , γ3 = ε3 is a system of simple roots for H. The roots of H are:
RH = {±(εi ± εjP     ) | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3}
                                      L∪ {±e3 }.
   Write xαi =          α∈RH  z i,α ∈   α∈RH hα for i = 1, 2 (since xαi is nilpotent, it
has no component in h0 ). To prove (1), it suffices to show that z1,α = 0 whenver
α 6= γ1 , γ3 ; this follows from (6.1). To prove (2), it suffices to show that z2,α = 0
whenver α 6= γ2 ; this follows from (6.2).
   Let Uαi ≤ G (i = 1, 2) be the simple root subgroups. We claim that Uαi is the
image of the map Xαi : Ga → G satisfying ρ(Xαi (s)) = exp(sdρ(xαi )). One can
see the claim in several ways. One is to realize G as a Chevalley group (see [Ste68]).
Alternatively, one may realize G as the automorphisms of an 8 dimensional Cayley
algebra O; the module V is the space orthogonal to the identity element of O. Since
the xαi act as derivations of O, their exponentials (which are defined thanks to our
assumption on p) yield automorphisms of O. The images of these exponentials
yield 1 dimensional unipotent subgroups of G normalized by T which are then
necessarily the desired root subgroups.
   Since p 6= 2, it is well-known that the simple root subgroups Vγi ≤ H are the
images of the maps Yγi : Ga → H given by Yγi (s) = exp(syγi ).
Lemma 27. We have ρ(Xα1 (s)) = Yγ1 (s)Yγ3 (s), and ρ(Xα2 (s)) = Yγ2 (s).
Proof. Since [yγ1 , yγ3 ] = 0, we have exp(sdρ(xα1 )) = exp(syγ1 ) exp(syγ3 ) and the
formula for α1 follows. The formula for α2 is simpler.

Proposition 28. Let X ∈ g be regular nilpotent, and u ∈ G be regular unipotent. Then
X and u both act as a single Jordan block on V = V (̟1 ).
Proof. Recall that the regular nilpotent and regular unipotent classes for H act as a
single Jordan block on the natural module of H. Also recall that for any reductive
group
P        L, if zα ∈ gα are non-zero root vectors for a system of simple roots, then
   α z α                          the images of Zα : Ga → L are the simple root
         is regular nilpotent. If Q
subgroups and aα ∈ k × , then α Zα (aα ) is regular unipotent (one may take the
product in any fixed order).
   In particular, xα + xβ is regular nilpotent in g, and by Lemma 26 we see that
dρ(xα + xβ ) = yγ1 + yγ2 + yγ3 is regular nilpotent in h. Thus X acts as a single
Jordan block as claimed.
   Similarly, v = Xα1 (1)Xα2 (1) is regular unipotent in G, and by Lemma 27,
                              ρ(v) = Yγ1 (1)Yγ3 (1)Yγ2 (1)
is regular unipotent in H. Thus u also acts as a single Jordan block.
6.2. The adjoint representation. Since p 6= 3, the Weyl module V (̟2 ) is irre-

ducible; it is isomorphic with the adjoint
   If W is a G-module, write ch W = µ dim Wµ · eµ for its character. For a dom-
inant weight µ, let χ(µ) = ch V (µ), where V (µ) is the Weyl module with high
weight µ. Brauer’s formula [Hum80, ex. 24.4(9)] yields
               ch V (̟1 ) ⊗ V (̟1 ) = χ(0) + χ(̟1 ) + χ(̟2 ) + χ(2̟1 ).
Since dim V (2̟1 ) = 27 (by Weyl’s formula) the character of Sym2 V (̟1 ) must be
                                           V2
χ(0) + χ(2̟1 ), and Lemma 2 yields ch V (̟1 ) = χ(̟1 ) + χ(̟2 ) (despite the
application of Lemma 2, these character formulas are valid in all characteristics).
Since p > 3, the Weyl modules V (̟1 ), V (̟2 ) are simple and we deduce from
[Jan87, Prop. II.2.14] that 0 = Ext1G (V (̟1 ), V (̟2 )) = Ext1G (V (̟2 ), V (̟1 )). Thus:
                  V
Proposition 29. 2 V (̟1 ) ≃ V (̟1 ) ⊕ V (̟2 ) is semisimple.

Theorem 30. Let G be a group with root system G2 and suppose p > 3. Let θ : N → U
be a G-equivariant isomorphism. For each X ∈ N , ad X and Ad θX have the same
partition.
Proof. Since p > 3, the only nilpotent class which is not p-nilpotent is the regular
class when p = 5; see for example [M02, Example §6.2]. Let X ∈ N be regular
nilpotent; hence also u = θ(X) is regular unipotent. Let ρ : G → H be as before.
Proposition 28 implies that dρ(X) and ρ(u) are respectively regular nilpotent and
regular unipotent in H. Thus Theorem 24 and Lemma 1 together imply that the
                         V2
partition of X acting on    V (̟1 ) is the same as that of u.
   Since both ad X and Ad u stabilize the direct sum decomposition in Proposition
29, and since Proposition 28 shows that both act as a single Jordan block on the
direct summand V (̟1 ), the theorem follows.
6.3. Adjoint partitions. We now use the techniques just developed to find the
adjoint partition for each nilpotent class. We begin with some lemmas.
   Let L be a reductive group with derived group L′ ≃ SL2 (k) and suppose that
dim L = 4. Let Z be a 1 dimensional central torus in L, and let W be a 4 dimen-
sional simple L module. Fix a maximal torus S of L′ ; the S weights on W must be
                                    ADJOINT JORDAN BLOCKS                                        15


±3, ±1. Since W is simple, Z acts with a single weight ζ on W ; suppose that the
integer ζ is non-0 (mod p).
Lemma 31. If 0 6= v1 ∈ W1 and 0 6= v−1 ∈ W−1 , then the L orbit of v = v1 + v−1 has
dimension 4.
Proof. Let e± ∈ Lie(L)±2 be non-0 weight vectors for S. Since W is a restricted
simple module for L′ , a theorem of Curtis implies that W is simple for Lie(L′ ); it
follows that the vectors e+ v1 ∈ W3 and e− v−1 ∈ W−3 are non-zero.
   Choose 0 6= h ∈ Lie(S) and 0 6= z ∈ Lie(Z). Then (z, h, e+ , e− ) is a basis for
Lie(L). Let x = az + bh + ce+ + de− with a, b, c, d ∈ k, and suppose that x.v = 0.
   Since ce+ v1 is the component of x.v in W3 , we deduce that c = 0. Similarly,
d = 0. Thus x = az + bh, and x.v = (aζ + b)v1 + (aζ − b)v−1 . It follows that
0 = aζ + b = aζ − b; since the characteristic is not 2 and ζ is non-0 in k, one has
a = b = 0.
   To finish the proof, write H = StabL (v). Then Lie(H) is the stabilizer in Lie(L)
of v, hence is 0 by the above remarks. Thus dim H = 0, so that dim L/H = 4 as
desired.

Remark 32. The proof of the lemma shows that the orbit map π : L → Lv is sepa-
rable.

Lemma 33. Let p = pα1 = g−α1 + b, where b is the Borel subalgebra of g corresponding
to the choice of positive roots determined by α1 , α2 . Let u be the Lie algebra of the unipotent
radical U of the parabolic subgroup P with Lie(P ) = p. Let
        xα1 +α2 = [xα1 , xα2 ] ∈ uα1 +α2      and     x2α1 +α2 = [xα1 , xα1 +α2 ] ∈ u2α1 +α2 .
Then
   1. x = xα1 +α2 + x2α1 +α2 is a representative for the dense (Richardson) orbit of P on
      u.
   2. Put yγ1 +γ2 = [yγ1 , yγ2 ], yγ2 +γ3 = [yγ2 , yγ3 ], and yγ2 +2γ3 = [yγ3 , yγ2 +γ3 ] ∈ h.
      Then dρ(x) = yγ1 +γ2 + yγ2 +γ3 + yγ2 +2γ3 .
Proof. Let L = P/U ; thus L is reductive and its derived group L′ is simple of type
A1 . The image of the co-character α∨                                 ′
                                         1 is a maximal torus of L . Now, L acts on
u = u/[u, u] and in fact has a dense orbit on this space. Moreover, if y ∈ u is a
representative for the dense L orbit, then any y ∈ u with image y lies in the dense
(Richardson) P -orbit on u.
   We have u = gα2 + gα1 +α2 + g2α1 +α2 + g3α1 +α2 + g3α1 +2α2 , and [u, u] = g3α1 +2α2 .
Since p > 3, the latter assertion follows from the commutator formulas in [Ste68,
Theorem 1]; these commutator formulas also show that xα1 +α2 and x2α1 +α2 are
non-0.
   The weights of α∨   1 on u are thus ±3, ±1; it follows that u affords a restricted
simple 4-dimensional representation for L′ . Consider the co-character γ = α∨         1 +
2α∨2 . Since hα1 , γi = 0, the image Z of γ is a central torus in L. Since hα2 , γi = 1, γ
acts with weight 1 on u. Let x be the image of x in u. Applying Lemma 31, we see
that the L orbit through x has dimension 4, and (1) follows.
   For (2) note first that dρ(xα1 +α2 ) = yγ1 +γ2 + yγ2 +γ3 . Since
               dρ(x2α1 +α2 ) = [yγ1 , yγ2 +γ3 ] + [yγ3 , yγ1 +γ2 ] + [yγ3 , yγ2 +γ3 ]
16                                   GEORGE MCNINCH


an application of the Jacobi identity shows that dρ(x2α1 +α2 ) = [yγ3 , yγ2 +γ3 ] and (2)
follows.

Lemma 34. Let F be the additive formal group law, and let R = RF be the its represen-
tation ring (see §4.2). For p > 3, we have the following identities in R:
      V
   1. 2 (2J3 + J1 ) = J5 + 5J3 + J1 .

   2.     (J + 2J2 ) = 2J4 + 2J3 + 2J2 + J1 .

facts which the reader may easily check:       J2 = J1 ,    J 3 = J3 , J3 ⊗ J3 = J5 +
J3 + J1 , J3 ⊗ J2 = J4 + J2 , and J2 ⊗ J2 = J3 + J1 .                     V2
   For p ≥ 7, (4) follows by considering the tilting SL2 (k)-module          L(6), and
applying Proposition 5. When p = 5 one checks (4) by hand (or by computer).

Theorem 35. The partitions of the non-0 nilpotent classes of g on V (̟1 ) and on the
adjoint representation are as follows (recall that p > 3):
         nilpotent orbit   partition on V (̟1 )   adjoint partition
               A1          (22 , 13 )             (3, 24 , 13 )
               f1

                                                  (72 )             if p = 7.
Proof. The adjoint partitions may be obtained from the partitions on V (̟1 ) by
applying Lemma 34 and Proposition 29.
   To obtained the partitions on V = V (̟1 ) note the following. xα2 is a repre-
sentative for the class A1 , and xα1 is a representative for the class A   f1 ; one now
deduces the partitions from (6.1) and (6.2). The partition of the regular class G2 is
obtained from Proposition 28.
   Lemma 33 gives a representative x for the class G2 (a1 ); moreover, it shows that
dρ(x) = a + b + c with 0 6= a ∈ hγ1 +γ2 , 0 6= b ∈ hγ2 +γ3 and 0 6= c ∈ hγ2 +2γ3 . If a, b, c
are any non-0 elements of the indicated weight spaces of h, a direct calculation
shows that the partition of a + b + c on V is (3, 3, 1).

Remark 36. According to Theorem 30 the partitions in (6.3) are also valid for the
unipotent classes. Lawther [Law95] has computed adjoint Jordan blocks for unipo-
tent elements in exceptional groups, and our results agree with his in this case.
   The descriptions in §6.1 imply that the partitions of the unipotent classes on
V (̟1 ) are given by (6.3); this again agrees with Lawther’s calculations.

                7. A DJOINT J ORDAN      BLOCKS IN CHARACTERISTIC         0
   In this section, we work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0; in
order to emphasize the characteristic, we will call this field F rather than k. G will
be a simple algebraic group over F , and g = Lie(G) will be its Lie algebra.
   Fix a distinguished nilpotent element X ∈ g, and choose an sl2 -triple in g
containing X, and let φ : SL2 (F ) → G be the homomorphism such that the

image of dφ is the span of this sl2 -triple. We may suppose that the cocharacter
ν(t) = φ(diag(t, t−1 )) : F × → G satisfies Ad ν(t)X = t2 X (t ∈ F × ).
   Let g(i) = g(i; ν) denote the i-th weight space for Ad ν. Since X is distinguished,
[Car93, 5.7.6] shows that g(2i + 1) = 0 for i ∈ Z .
   Let n ≥ 0 be the largest integer for which g(2n) 6= 0. Fix ζ ∈ F × a root of unity
of order n + 1, and let s = ν(ζ 1/2 ) ∈ G (choose either square root of ζ in F ). The
eigenvalues of Ad(s) on g are integeral powers of ζ; the ζ i eigenspace of Ad(s) is
                     Vi = g(2i) ⊕ g(2i − 2n − 2) for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
  Let M ∈ g(−2n), and put S = X + M ∈ V1 .

  1. Ad(s) stabilizes Cg (S) and has no non-0 fixed points in Cg (S).
  2. V1 contains a regular semisimple element if and only if S is regular semisimple for

  Let n = i>0 g(i) and n− = i<0 g(i). The following lemma may be found in
[Kos59, Lemma 6.4A] for the case where X is regular; we have essentially copied
Kostant’s argument.
Lemma 38. Let ρ : g → n be the projection with kernel n− ⊕ g(0). Then ρ ◦ Ad(s) =
Ad(s) ◦ ρ, the restriction ρ|c to c = cg (S) takes values in cg (X), and ρ|c is injective.
Proof. The Ad(s)-equivariance of ρ is immediate. Let Y ∈ c and write
                           Y = U + A + V ∈ n− ⊕ g(0) ⊕ n.
We claim that V = ρ(Y ) ∈ cg (X). Indeed, note that
                        [M, Y ] = [M, A] + [M, V ] ∈ n− + g(0),
so that ρ([M, Y ]) = 0. Since Y ∈ c, one has 0 = ρ([S, Y ]) = ρ([X, Y ] + [M, Y ]) =
ρ([X, Y ]). Since [X, U ] ∈ n− + g(0), we have
                                                                M
               0 = ρ([X, Y ]) = ρ([X, A]) + ρ([X, V ]) ∈ g(2) ⊕   g(i).
                                                                  i≥4

It follows that [X, A] = ρ([X, A]) = 0 and [X, V ] = ρ([X, V ]) = 0; this proves that
V ∈ cg (X).
    Since X is distinguished, ad(X) : g(0) → g(2) is bijective [Car93, 5.7.4]; it fol-
lows that cg (X) ⊂ n (view g as a representation for the sl2 (F )-triple to see that
cg (X) ⊂ g(0) + n). Since [X, A] = 0, we have A = 0. Thus we see that Y ∈ c has
the form Y = U + V ∈ n− ⊕ n+ .
    Now suppose that Y ∈ ker ρ ∩ c; by the previous remarks we have Y ∈ n− .
Considering homogeneous components of Y , one sees that [M, Y ] = 0. It follows
that 0 = [S, Y ] = [M, Y ] + [X, Y ] = [X, Y ] i.e. Y ∈ cg (X). Since cg (X) ∩ n− = 0, we
have Y = 0 and the lemma is proved.
   Let h = Lie(T ) be the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of G with Weyl group
W = NG (T )/T . Then W acts by graded algebra automorphisms on the coordinate
ring F [h]. Since W is a reflection group, a theorem of Chevalley says that the
algebra of invariants F [h]W is generated by r = dim h algebraically independent
homogeneous polynomials φ1 , . . . , φr whose degrees are uniquely determined, up
to order. The exponents of W are the numbers ei = deg φi − 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ r.

   The following theorem generalizes the result proved by Kostant [Kos59] in the
case where X is regular nilpotent.
Theorem 39. Suppose that V1 contains a regular semisimple element of g. Let e1 , . . . , er
be the exponents of the Weyl group of G, and for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, let 1 ≤ fi ≤ n be the unique
quantity satisfying fi ≡ −ei (mod n). Then ad X has a Jordan block of size 2fi + 1 for
each 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
Proof. Since V1 contains a regular semisimple element, Lemma 37(2) shows that
we may choose M ∈ g(−2n) such that S = M + X is regular semisimple. Then the
centralizer h′ = cg (S) is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus T ′ of G.
   Now part (1) of Lemma 37 shows that s = ν(ζ 1/2 ) determines an element w of
the Weyl group NG (T ′ )/T ′ . Moreover, w has a regular eigenvector in h′ , namely
S; it is thus a regular Weyl group element; see [Spr74, §4] for these notions. In
particular, [Spr74, Theorem 4.2] shows that the eigenvalues of w (i.e. of Ad(s)) on
h′ are ζ −ei = ζ fi for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
   Let s be the sl2 (X)-triple containing X; as s-module, we may write
                             g = L(2λ1 ) ⊕ L(2λ2 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L(2λt ).
Here L(µ) is the simple s-module of dimension µ + 1; since S is distinguished, any
simple s-summand of g has even highest weight.
    We may chose vi ∈ g(2λi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ t such that v1 , . . . , vt is a basis for cg (X).
It follows that the eigenvalues of Ad(s) on cg (X) are ζ λj for 1 ≤ j ≤ t.
    By Lemma 38 the map ρ : cg (S) → cg (X) is injective and Ad(s)-equivariant. Re-
ordering the λi if necessary, we may therefore suppose that ζ λj = ζ fj for 1 ≤ j ≤ r.
For each j we have 1 ≤ λj ≤ n and 1 ≤ fj ≤ n, whence λj = fj and the theorem
follows.

Remark 40. The hypothesis that V1 contains a regular semisimple element is satis-
fied if the condition in (3) of Lemma 37 holds. In [Spr74], Springer lists the nilpo-
tent classes for which (3) holds (though there is class for type G2 in that list that
doesn’t belong).
   Springer’s results yield a map from nilpotent orbits for which V1 contains a
regular semisimple element to conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. Kazhdan and
Lusztig [KL88] have defined a map from all nilpotent orbits to conjugacy classes
in the Weyl group; their map agrees with Springer’s when his is defined.
   For a nilpotent X ∈ g, let σ(X) denote the corresponding conjugacy class in W
under the Kazhdan-Lusztig map. In the case where X is distinguished and σ(X)
consists of regular elements of W in Springer’s sense, it appears from empirical
observation that Theorem 39 is still valid, i.e. one obtains r of the Jordan block
sizes of ad(X) from the eigenvalues of σ(X). I have not so far been able to give a
proof which explains this phenomenon.
