                                                                                  VICTOR OSTRIK


                                                    Abstract. In this note we show that all reductive groups are clean in char-
                                                    acteristic ≥ 3. In characteristic 2 there are two cuspidal local systems (one for
                                                    F4 and one for E8 ) which can not be handled by our method.




                                                                                 1. Introduction
                                            1.1. Let G be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field of
                                            characteristic p ≥ 0. In the study of the character sheaves on the group G ([5])
                                            an important technical assumption is that the group G is clean. This means that
                                            all cuspidal local systems (see [4]) on all Levi subgroups of G are clean (that is
                                            the IC-extension of these local systems coincides with the extension by zero). It is
                                            expected that any group G is clean; equivalently any cuspidal local system is clean
                                            for any reductive group G. It is known [5] that the last assertion is equivalent to
                                            the similar assertion with G assumed to be almost simple. It was shown in [5] that
                                            any cuspidal local system is clean if
                                               1) G is of classical type and p is arbitrary;
                                               2) G is of type E6 and p = 0 or p > 2;
                                               3) G is of type G2 , F4 , E7 and p = 0 or p > 3;
                                               4) G is of type E8 and p = 0 or p > 5.
                                               In [7, 8] T. Shoji used the Shintani descent theory to improve the bounds for p
                                            above for G of types G2 , F4 , E8 .
                                               The aim of this note is to present a simple argument which proves
                                               Theorem 1. Let G be an almost simple group. Then any cuspidal local system
                                            on G is clean except, possibly, two cases: p = 2 and G is of type F4 or E8 .
                                               Moreover, in each unsettled case there is exactly one cuspidal local system which
                                            is not known to be clean. In view of results of Lusztig [5] and Shoji [7, 8] Theorem
                                            1 is new only for G of type E6 and p = 2 and G of type E7 and p = 3.

                                            1.2. Applications. Recall that Lusztig defined a class of perverse sheaves on group
                                            G called the admissible complexes, see [4]. It is known that the character sheaves
                                            form a subset of admissible sheaves, see [5]. It is known in many cases that actually
                                            character sheaves coincide with admissible complexes, see [5, 7, 8].
                                               Theorem 2. The class of character sheaves coincides with the class of admissible
                                            complexes for any p ≥ 0.
                                               In view of Lusztig’s results in [5] 7.1 Theorem 2 is an immediate consequence of
                                            Theorem 2.12 (a) below.
                                               Recall that Lusztig defined generalized Springer correspondence in [4] which
                                            is a bijection between the irreducible Ad(G)−equivariant local systems supported
                                            on the unipotent orbits and the irreducible representations of some collection of
                                            Coxeter groups. The generalized Springer correspondence is known explicitly [6, 9,
                                                                                           1
2                                  VICTOR OSTRIK


5] in all cases with two very small gaps: in the case when the Coxeter group is of
type G2 there is an ambiguity in attaching the local systems to two-dimensional
representations of this group for G of type E6 when p = 2 and E8 when p = 3.
This ambiguity can be now removed using the method used by Lusztig in [5] 24.10
to handle a similar problem for E6 , p > 3. We use below the notations from [9].
   Proposition 1. Let G be of type E6 and p = 2 (respectively, of type E8 and
p = 3). Under the generalized Springer correspondence the reflection representation
of G2 corresponds to the local system supported on the orbit of type A5 (respectively
E7 ).
   We omit the proof since it coincides with [5] 24.10 (note that the calculation of
the corresponding generalized Green functions are almost identical for E6 and E8 ).
1.3. Acknowledgment. I learned the definition of the automorphism ΘF which
is crucial for this paper from Roman Bezrukavnikov who in turn learned it from
Vladimir Drinfeld. I am happy to thank both of them. I am deeply grateful to
George Lusztig for very useful conversations. Thanks are also due to Toshiaki
Shoji for interesting comments. This work was supported in part by NSF grants
DMS-0098830 and DMS-0111298.

                                     2. Proofs
2.1. Let a, p : G × G be the adjoint action and the second projection respectively:
a(g, x) = gxg −1 , p(g, x) = x. Let F be a complex of (constructible) sheaves on
G which is Ad(G)−equivariant in the naive sense: we are given an isomorphism
ξ : a∗ F → p∗ F satisfying the cocycle relation, see e.g. [7]. Let ∆ : G → G × G
be the diagonal embedding. Obviously p∆ = a∆ = Id. The following definition is
crucial for this note:
Definition 2.1. We define a canonical automorphism ΘF of F as the composition:
                                        ∆∗ ξ
                F = (a∆)∗ F = ∆∗ a∗ F −→ ∆∗ p∗ F = (p∆)∗ F = F .
Remark 2.2. (i) The definition above makes sense in the case when G is a finite
group. In this case ΘF is well known in the conformal field theory under the name
of T −matrix, see e.g. [1].
   (ii) The automorphism ΘF was used in [2, 7] to prove that the characteristic
functions of character sheaves are eigenvectors for Shintani descent.
  We are going to apply this definition for two kinds of complexes: the usual
constructible sheaves and the perverse sheaves.
Lemma 2.3. Let F be a simple Ad(G)−equivariant perverse sheaf. Then ΘF =
θF IdF for some scalar θF .
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the Schur’s Lemma.                       
   Let O be an adjoint orbit in G and let x ∈ O. Recall that the functor L 7→ Lx
defines an equivalence { G−equivariant local systems L on O} → { Representations
of AG (x) := ZG (x)/ZG (x)0 } . Let x̄ be the class of x ∈ ZG (x) in the group AG (x).
Observe that x̄ ∈ AG (x) is central.
Lemma 2.4. Under the equivalence above we have ΘL = x̄|Lx .
Proof. This is a direct consequence of definition.                                  

   Combining Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4 one can calculate the number θF for an irre-
ducible Ad(G)−equivariant perverse sheaf F in the following way: take any point
x ∈ G such that Fx 6= 0, then x̄ ∈ AG (x) acts on Fx via the scalar θF .
   Now let P be a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi quotient L. Recall (see
[5]) that the induction functors IndP : { Ad(L)−equivariant sheaves on L} →
{ Ad(G)−equivariant sheaves on G} is defined as follows: consider the variety
G̃P = {(x, gP ) ∈ G × G/P |g −1 xg ∈ P }. The group G acts on G̃P in the following
way: h · (x, gP ) = (hxh−1 , hgP ). It is easy to see that we have an equivalence: ν:
{ G−equivariant sheaves on G̃P } ≃ { Ad(P )−equivariant sheaves on P } . Let
m : P → L be the canonical projection and let n : G̃P → G be defined by
n(x, gP ) = x. Then the functor IndP := n! ν −1 m∗ (we use here just naive notion
of the equivariance but a similar construction holds for example in the equivariant
derived category).
Lemma 2.5. The automorphism ΘF commutes with the induction functor:
                               IndP (ΘF ) = ΘIndP (F ) .
Proof. Easy.                                                                         
Remark 2.6. A statement similar to Lemma 2.5 involving the Shintani descent
twisting operator instead of ΘF is contained in [2, 7].
2.2. Calculation of θF for some unipotent cuspidal pairs. We refer the reader
to [4] for the definition of the cuspidal pair (C, L) for the group G (recall only that
                                                                               0
here C is some inverse image of conjugacy class under projection G → G/ZG        and L
is some Ad(G)−equivariant local system on G). In this section we consider the case
when G is semisimple and C is an unipotent class (such cuspidal pairs are called
unipotent) and calculate θF for F = L (extended by zero to G). First note that
Lemma 2.7. Assume that the characteristic of k is good for G. Then θL = 1 for
any unipotent cuspidal pair (C, L).
Proof. Obviously it is enough to prove the Lemma for simply connected almost
simple groups. For groups of type A the order of AG (u) for any unipotent element
u is relatively prime to the characteristic of k and hence ū = 1 (since the order
of u is some power of the characteristic); the result follows from Lemma 2.4. For
other classical groups AG (u) is a 2-group; thus ū ∈ AG (u) is trivial. Similarly,
for groups of type E6 , E7 the order of AG (u) is always relatively prime with the
characteristic (assumed to be good). If the group G is of type G2 , F4 , E8 then the
unipotent cuspidal local system (C cL) is unique. In these cases for u ∈ C one has
AG (u) = S3 , S4 , S5 respectively. Thus AG (u) has trivial center, hence ū = 1. 
   Now we are going to calculate θL for unipotent cuspidal pairs in the exceptional
groups. We are going to use the following fact due to T. Springer and B. Lou [10, 3]:
Theorem 2.8. Let u ∈ G be a regular unipotent element and let U ⊂ G be the
maximal unipotent subgroup containing u. Then ZG (u) = ZG × ZU (u); moreover
the group ZU (u)/ZU0 (u) is cyclic and is generated by ū.
   The list of unipotent cuspidal pairs for exceptional groups is given in [9]. We
give the values of θL in all bad characteristic cases using the notations of loc. cit.
In the table below ζ (respectively ξ) is a fixed primitive root of unity of degree 3
(respectively 5).

Comments on the calculation. In cases 1,3,5,9,11,13,14,15,23 the calculation
is immediate from 2.8; in cases 2,4,7,8,10,19,20,22,24 the calculation is immediate
from the fact that ū is central in AG (u). The calculation in case 12 is as follows:
assume that ū 6= 1 in this case, then for the representation φ′ = −1 of AG (u) we will
have φ′ (ū) = −1; this is a contradiction since the local system L′ corresponding to
φ′ appears in the principal series (see [9]) and thus we have θL′ = 1 by Lemma 2.5;
thus ū = 1 and the result follows. The similar method applies to cases 16,17,18,21.
Finally, for the case 6 see [7] 7.2 (it is stated there that ū is nontrivial in this case;
one way to see this is an explicit calculation; one can also use the results on Shintani
descent, see loc. cit.).
Remark 2.9. For types G2 , F4 , E8 the numbers in the table were computed by
T. Shoji [7, 8] as the eigenvalues of the twisting operator.
    The important consequence of the calculation above is the following
Corollary 2.10. Let L1 6= L2 be two cuspidal local systems on a simple group G.
Then θL1 6= θL2 except for char(k) = 2 and G is of type F4 or E8 .
Remark 2.11. Note that the results above together with the explicit knowledge
of the generalized Springer correspondence for exceptional groups [9] allow to de-
termine ū for all unipotent elements u in these groups.

2.3. Cleanness of cuspidal local systems. Recall that a local system L on a
locally closed subset U of a variety X is called clean if j! L = j!∗ L where j : U ⊂ X
is the obvious embedding. It is expected that all cuspidal local systems are clean.
Here is a main result of this note:
Theorem 2.12. (a) Any cuspidal sheaf is a character sheaf.
   (b) Assume that G is an almost simple exceptional group. Let (C, L) be a cuspidal
pair for G. Then L is clean except possibly two cases: k is of characteristic 2 and
   1) G is of type F4 and C is unipotent orbit of type F4 (a2 ) (there is a unique such
cuspidal pair);
   2) G is of type E8 and C is unipotent orbit of type D8 (a1 ) (there is a unique
such cuspidal pair).
Proof. The theorem is known to be true for classical groups and for exceptional
groups in good characteristic [5]. The proof for exceptional groups in bad charac-
teristic is quite similar to proofs in [5]. First one shows that any cuspidal character
sheaf is clean (except, possibly, two cases in (b)) using Proposition 7.9 of [5] III
with the action of the center replaced by the automorphism ΘF and using Corollary
2.10 (recall that it is enough to consider the cuspidal local systems supported on
the unipotent orbits, see [5] 7.11). Then the results of [5] provide a classification of
character sheaves. Finally one compares the list of cuspidal character sheaves with
the list of cuspidal local systems (known from [4]) and deduces (a). The case when
p = 2 and G is of type F4 or E8 requires additional arguments, see [7] 7.3 and [8]
5.3.
