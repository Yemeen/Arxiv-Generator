                                                      The behavior of the images of a fixed element of order p in irreducible representations of
                                                  a classical algebraic group in characteristic p with highest weights large enough with respect
                                                  to p and this element is investigated. More precisely, let G be a classical algebraic group of
                                                  rank r over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p > 2. Assume that an element
                                                  x ∈ G of order p is conjugate to that of an algebraic group of the same type and rank m < r
                                                  naturally embedded into G. Next, an integer function σx on the set of dominant weights of
                                                  G and a constant cx that depend only upon x, and a polynomial d of degree one are defined.
                                                  It is proved that the image of x in the irreducible representation of G with highest weight ω
                                                  contains more than d(r − m) Jordan blocks of size p if m and r − m are not too small and
                                                  σx (ω) ≥ p − 1 + cx .

                                                 Asymptotic lower estimates for the number of Jordan blocks of size p in the images of a fixed
                                             element of order p in irreducible representations of a classical algebraic group in characteristic
                                             p with highest weights large enough with respect to p and this element are obtained. More
                                             precisely, let G be a classical algebraic group of rank r over an algebraically closed field K of
                                             characteristic p > 2. Assume that an element x ∈ G of order p is conjugate to that of an
                                             algebraic group Gm of the same type and rank m < r naturally embedded into G. Set
                                                                                      (
                                                                                        r−m       for G = Ar (K),
                                                                          d(r − m) =
                                                                                        2r − 2m for other types.

                                             Let ∆x be the labelled Dynkin diagram of the conjugacy class containing x in the sense of Bala
                                             and Carter [1] and let cx be the sum of the labels at ∆x for G 6= Ar (K) and the half of this
                                             sum for G = Ar (K). For brevity, throughout the article we refer to ∆x as the labelled Dynkin
                                             diagram of x. Next, an integer function σx on the set of dominant weights of G that depends
                                             only upon ∆x is defined. For p-restricted weights σx coincides with the canonical homomorphism
                                             determined by ∆x . It is proved that the image of x in the irreducible representation of G with
                                             highest weight ω contains more than d(r − m) Jordan blocks of size p if m and r − m are not
                                             too small and σx (ω) ≥ p − 1 + cx .
                                                We need some more notation to formulate the main results. Let ωi and αi be the fundamental
                                             weights and the simple roots of G (with respect to a fixed maximal torus T ) labelled as in [2].
                                             Denote by δi , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, the label on ∆x corresponding to its ith node. We have 0 ≤ δi ≤ 2. In
                                             what follows Z is the set of integers, X = X(G) is the set of weights of G, X+ ⊂ X is the set of
                                             dominant weights, Irr = Irr(G) is the set of irreducible rational representations of G (considered
                    if µ = ri=1 ai ωi with all ai < p. Each weight      + can be represented in
                          P
called p-restricted

the form j=0 p ω where ω are p-restricted. Set σx (ω) = τx ( j=0 ω ). Now we can state our
main result.

Theorem 1 Let ϕ ∈ Irr and σx (ω(ϕ)) ≥ p − 1 + cx . Assume that m > 1 for G = Br (K) or
Dr (K), r − m > 1 for G = Ar (K), and > 3 for G = Br (K) or Dr (K). Then the element ϕ(x)
has more than d(r − m) Jordan blocks of size p.

Proposition 2 below shows that one cannot weaken the inequality for σx (ω(ϕ)) in Theorem 1
and that the estimates obtained are asymptotically exact.

Proposition 2 Let ϕ ∈ Irr and ω = ω(ϕ) = aω1 with a < p. Assume that m and r are such as
in Theorem 1 and x is a regular unipotent element in Gm . Set c = m for G = Ar (K), 2m for
G = Br (K), 2m − 1 for G = Cr (K), and 2m − 2 for G = Dr (K). Suppose that p > c. Then
|x| = p, σx (ω) = ac and cx = c. There exist constants NG (a, m, p) and QG (a, m, p) that depend
upon the type of G, a, m, and p and do not depend upon r such that ϕ(x) contains at most
NG (a, m, p) Jordan blocks of size p if p < ac < p + c − 1 and at most d(r − m) + QG (a, m, p)
such blocks if ac = p + c − 1.

    Put l = [(m + 2)/2] for G = Ar (K) and l = m otherwise. By Lemma 3 below, cx = li=1 δi
                                                                                             P
and cx ≤ p − 1. Hence cx ≤ 2l.
    For ϕ ∈ Irr define the weight ω̄(ϕ) as follows: write down the p-adic expansion          for the
weight ω = ω(ϕ) considered before the statement of Theorem 1 and set ω̄(ϕ) = sj=0 ω j . So
                                                                                       P
σx (ω(ϕ)) = τx (ω̄(ϕ)).
    The study of an asymptotic behavior of elements of order p in representations of the classical
groups in characteristic p was begun by the author in [12] where a notion of a p-large represen-
tation was introduced. In our present notation a representation ϕ ∈ Irr is p-large if and only if
σx (ω(ϕ)) ≥ p for a long root element x ∈ G (an equivalent definition from [12]: the value of ω̄(ϕ)
on the maximal root is ≥ p). The common goal of [12] and the present article is to investigate the
behavior of elements of order p in irreducible representations in characteristic p for a fixed p and
r → ∞ and to discover asymptotic regularities which are specific for prime characteristics but
do not (or almost do not) depend upon p. Such properties can find applications in recognizing
representations and linear groups. According to [12, Theorem 1.1], the image of any element of
order p in a p-large representation has at least f (r) Jordan blocks of size p where

In [12, Theorem 1.3] for p > 2 and all types of the classical groups examples of representations
ϕ ∈ Irr such that ϕ(x) has only one Jordan block of size p for a long root element x and
σx (ω(ϕ)) = p − 1 are given. It is also shown [12, Theorem 1.4] that the estimates in [12,
Theorem 1.1] are asymptotically exact for the groups of type A, B, and D provided p > 2 in
the last two cases.
    In what follows C is the complex field, GC is the simple algebraic group over C of the same
the degree of the minimal polynomial of ρ(z). It is well known that kρ (z) is equal to the maximal
size of a Jordan block of ρ(z). If ϕ ∈ Irr, then ϕC is the irreducible representation of GC with
highest weight ω̄(ϕ). For unipotent x ∈ G put kϕC (x) = kϕC (y) where y ∈ GC is a unipotent
element with the labelled Dynkin diagram ∆x (this is correctly determined). Now let |x| = p.
By the results [11, Theorem 1.1, Lemma 2.5, and Proposition 2.12], kϕC (x) = σx (ω(ϕ)) + 1 and
kϕ (x) = min{p, kϕC (x)}. Hence if z is a long root element, then kϕ (z) = kϕC (z) if and only if
ϕ is not p-large. The results of [11] imply that for not very small p and r there exists a wide
class of representations ϕ ∈ Irr such that kϕ (z) = kϕC (z) < p for a long root element z ∈ G,
but kϕ (x) = p < kϕC (x) for many other elements x ∈ G of order p. In this connection in [13,
Section 2] a notion of a p-large representation for a given element x of order p was introduced.
A representation ϕ ∈ Irr was called p-large for x if σx (ω(ϕ)) ≥ p. It has been conjectured ([13,
Conjecture 1] that if x ∈ Gm , r is large enough with respect to m and ϕ is p-large for x, then
ϕ(x) has at least F (r) blocks of size p where F is an increasing function. Our Proposition 2
formally disproves this conjecture, but Theorem 1 actually proves a refined version of it with a
stronger assumption on σx (ω(ϕ)). Thus for arbitrary elements x there is a gap between the class
of representations ϕ ∈ Irr with kϕ (x) = kϕC (x) and that of representations where asymptotic
estimates for the number of Jordan blocks of size p in ϕ(x) hold. Perhaps for some classes of
elements of order p stronger estimates than those of Theorem 1 are possible, but now it is not
clear how to determine such classes.
    The case p = 2 is not considered here, but in this situation ϕ ∈ Irr is 2-large if ω(ϕ) 6= 2j ωi .
For 2-large representations the estimates from [12, Theorem 1.1] are available. For remaining
representations certain estimates could be obtained as well, but this article does not seem a
proper place for this. We plan to handle this question in a subsequent paper which will be
devoted to refining some estimates in [12].
    The results of this article as well as those of [12] can be easily transferred to irreducible
K-representations of finite classical groups in characteristic p.


1    Notation and preliminary comments
Throughout the article for a semisimple algebraic group S the symbols Irr(S), X(S), and X+ (S)
mean the same as the similar ones for G introduced earlier; R(S) is the set of roots of S,
hS1 , . . . , Sj i is the subgroup in S generated by subgroups S1 , . . . , Sj ; Irrp (S) ⊂ Irr(S) is the set
of p-restricted representations, i.e. irreducible representations with p-restricted highest weights;
X(ϕ) (X(M )) is the set of weights of a representation ϕ (a module M ); dim M is the dimension
of M ; M (ω) is the irreducible S-module with highest weight ω; L is the Lie algebra of G;
R = R(G), R+ ⊂ R is the set of positive roots; Irrp = Irrp (G); Xβ ⊂ G and Xβ ∈ L are the
root subgroup and the root element associated with β ∈ R, X±i = X±αi , and X±i = X±αi . Set
H(β1 , . . . , βj ) = hXβ1 , X−β1 . . . , Xβj , X−βj i. For ω ∈ X(S) and α ∈ R(S) denote by hω, αi the
value of the weight ω on the root α. For an S-module M and a unipotent element x ∈ S define
kM (x) similarly to kϕ (x). If |x| = p, then nϕ (x) is the number of Jordan blocks of size p of the
matrix ϕ(x) for a representation ϕ of S and nM (x) denotes the same number for a module M
affording ϕ.
    An element x ∈ G of order p can be embedded into a closed connected subgroup Γ of type
A1 whose labelled diagram coincides with ∆x (see [6, Theorem 4.2]). Set X1 = X(A1 (K)) (the
simply connected group of this type) and identify X1 with Z mapping aω1 ∈ X1 into a ∈ Z.
Then X(Γ) can be identified with a subset of Z. The canonical homomorphism τx can be
obtained as the restriction of weights from a maximal torus T ⊂ G to a maximal torus T1 ⊂ Γ
such that T1 ⊂ T . From now on we fix the tori T and T1 , and all weights and roots of G and
[3, ch. VIII, §13]. Set ei = τx (εi ). One can choose Γ, T and T1 such that the restriction to Γ
of the natural representation of G is a direct sum of irreducible components with p-restricted
highest weights (see comments in [14, Section 3]); ei ≥ ej for i < j; ei ≥ 0 if G = Ar (K) and
i ≤ (r + 1)/2; and ei ≥ 0 for all i ≤ r if G 6= Ar (K). If H ⊂ G is a semisimple subgroup
generated by some root subgroups, then TH = T ∩ H is a maximal torus in H. If T1 ⊂ TH , we
denote by the same symbol τx the homomorphism X(H) → Z determined by restricting weights
from TH to T1 . This causes no confusion. If an element v of some G-module is an eigenvector
for T , we denote its weights with respect to T , TH , and T1 by ω(v), ωH (v), and ωΓ (v). In what
follows x is conjugate to an element of Gm , |x| = p, m and r − m are such as in the assertion of
Theorem 1, and δi = τx (αi ), 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
Lemma 3 Set l = [(m + 2)/2] for G = Ar (K) and l = m otherwise. Then cx = li=1 δi and
                                                                                      P
cx ≤ p − 1.
Proof. Put k = l − 1 for G = Ar (K), m = 2t, and k = l for G = Ar (K), m = 2t + 1. Our
assumptions on ei , m − r, and x imply that ei = 0 for k < i < r + 2 − k if G = Ar (K) and
ei = 0 for i > m otherwise; notice that ek+1 = ek+2 = 0 for G = ArP   (K). Now it follows from
the definition of cx and the formulae in [3, ch. VIII, §13] that cx = li=1 δi = e1 − el+1 = e1 .
As e1 is a weight of a p-restricted Γ-module, we have e1 < p. This yields the lemma.
Proof of Theorem 1. Set ω = ω(ϕ) and let ω = ri=1 ai ωi . It is clear that ω 6= 0 as τx (ω) 6= 0.
                                                 P
Define subgroups H1 and H2 ⊂ G as follows. For G = Ar (K) set u = r − t + 2 if m = 2t and
r − t + 1 if m = 2t + 1, β = εt+1 − εu ,

                 H1 = H(α1 , . . . , αt , β, αu , . . . , αr ),   H2 = H(αt+2 , . . . , αu−2 )

(we have H1 = H(α1 , ε2 − εr+1 ) for m = 2 and H1 = H(ε1 − εr+1 ) for m = 1). For G = Br (K),
Cr (K), or Dr (K) put β = εm , 2εm , or εm−1 + εm , respectively, and

                                        H1 = H(α1 , . . . , αm−1 , β).

Next, set

                                  H2 = H(αm+1 , . . . , αr−1 , εr−1 + εr )

for G = Br (K) and

                                           H2 = H(αm+1 , . . . , αr )

for G = Cr (K) or Dr (K) (here H1 = H(β) for G = Cr (K) and m = 1). One easily observes
that the sets of roots in brackets used to define H1 and H2 yield bases of the systems R(H1 )
and R(H2 ), respectively. Denote these bases by Bi . In all cases H1 is conjugate to Gm in G. We
have H2 ∼ = Ar−m−1 (K), Dr−m (K), Cr−m (K), or Dr−m (K) for G = Ar (K), Br (K), Cr (K), or
Dr (K), respectively. It is clear that the subgroups H1 and H2 commute. Set H = H1 H2 . Let
Ui = hXγ | γ ∈ R+ , Xγ ⊂ Hi i, i = 1, 2, and U = U1 U2 . It is not difficult to conclude that Ui
is a maximal unipotent subgroup in Hi and U is such a subgroup in H. We can assume that
x ∈ U1 , Γ ⊂ H1 and T1 ⊂ TH1 . We shall write a weight µ ∈ X(H) in the form (µ1 , µ2 ) where
µi ∈ X(Hi ) is the restriction of µ to THi . Set M = M (ω).
    It is clear that nV (x) = dim(x − 1)p−1 V for each H-module V . Taking this into account,
it is not difficult to conclude the following. If 0 ⊂ W1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Wt = V is a filtration of V ,
Fi = Wi /Wi−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ t, and nFi (x) = ni , then
                                                           t
                                                           X
    First suppose that ϕ ∈ Irrp . Since passing to the dual representation does not influence the
Jordan form of ϕ(x), one can assume that ai 6= 0 for some i ≤ (r + 1)/2 if G = Ar (K). As for
p-large representations the estimates of [12, Theorem 1.1] hold; we also assume that ϕ is not
p-large. Hence hµ, αi < p for all µ ∈ X(ϕ) and long roots α (for all α if G = Ar (K) or Dr (K)).
By the formulae for the maximal roots of the classical groups in [2, Tables 1-4], this forces that

                                    a1 + . . . + ar < p     for   G = Ar (K) or     Cr (K),
                    a1 + 2a2 + . . . + 2ar−1 + ar < p       for   G = Br (K),                       (2)
            a1 + 2a2 + . . . + 2ar−2 + ar−1 + ar < p        for   G = Dr (K).

Now we proceed to construct two composition factors M1 and M2 of the restriction M |H such
that nM1 (x) ≥ d(r − m) and nM2 (x) > 0. This will be done for almost all ω. In exceptional
cases we shall find one factor M1 such that nM1 (x) > d(r − m). By (1), this would yield the
assertion of the theorem.
     Let v ∈ M be a nonzero highest weight vector. Put µi = ωHi (v). The vector v generates
an indecomposable H-module V1 with highest weight µ = (µ1 , µ2 ). Using (2), one can deduce
that hµ1 , βi < p for all β ∈ B1 . Here for G = Br (K) we take into account that m > 1. Hence
µ1 is p-restricted. Now assume that either G 6= Br (K), or ai 6= 0 for some i < r. For such
representations we construct another weight vector w ∈ M that is fixed by U . Set l = t + 1
for G = Ar (K), m = 2t; otherwise take l as in Lemma 3. First suppose that aj 6= 0 for some
j ≤ l (Case 1). Choose maximal such j and put w = X−l . . . X−(j+1) X−j v. Now let aj = 0 for
all j ≤ l (Case 2). Our assumptions on ai imply that ai 6= 0 for some i > l; furthermore, one
can take i ≤ (r + 1)/2 for G = Ar (K) and i < r for G = Br (K). Choose minimal such i and
set w = X−l . . . X−(i−1) X−i v if G 6= Dr (K) or i < r and w = X−l . . . X−(r−3) X−(r−2) X−r v for
G = Dr (K) and i = r. It follows from [12, Lemma 2.1(iii) and Lemma 2.9] that in all cases
w 6= 0. Using [10, Lemma 72] and analyzing the roots in B1 and B2 and the weight system X(ϕ),
we get that U fixes w in all situations. Here it is essential that the case G = Br (K) with ω = ar ωr
is excluded. In the latter case we cannot assert that Xβ fixes w. Set λi = ωHi (w), i = 1, 2. Now
it is clear that w generates an indecomposable H-module V2 with highest weight λ = (λ1 , λ2 ).
We claim that λ1 is p-restricted. Write down all the situations where hλ1 , γi =   6 hµ1 , γi for some
γ ∈ B1 . We have hλ1 , βi = hµ1 , βi − 1 in Case 1 if j = l and G 6= Br (K) or j = l − 1 and
G = Dr (K) and in Case 2 for G 6= Br (K) and all i; and hλ1 , βi = hµ1 , βi − 2 for G = Br (K)
both in Case 1 with j = l and in Case 2. In Case 1 we also have hλ1 , αj−1 i = hµ1 , αj−1 i + 1
if j > 1 and hλ1 , αj i = hµ1 , αj i − 1 if j < l. In Case 2 one gets hλ1 , αl−1 i = hµ1 , αl−1 i + 1 if
l > 1. In all other situations we have hλ1 , γi = hµ1 , γi. Now apply (2) to conclude that λ1 is
p-restricted.
     Set M1 = M (µ), M2 = M (λ), M1j = M (µj ), and M2j = M (λj ), j = 1, 2. Obviously,
Mi is a composition factor of Vi . It is well known that Mi = Mi1 ⊗ Mi2 . It is clear that
τx (µ1 ) = τx (ω) ≥ p. Since x ∈ H1 , we have δt = 0 if αt ∈ B2 . So by Lemma 3,
                                                      l
                                                      X
                    τx (λ1 ) = τx (ω(w)) ≥ τx (ω) −         δi = τx (ω) − cx ≥ p − 1.
                                                      i=1

It follows from [11, Theorem 1.1, Lemma 2.5, and Proposition 2.12] that kM 1 (x) = p. Hence
                                                                                i
nMi (x) ≥ dim Mi2 . One easily observes that M12 and M22 cannot both be trivial H2 -modules.
Our assumptions on r − m and [5, Proposition 5.4.13] imply that the dimension of a nontrivial
irreducible H2 -module is at least d(r − m). In the exceptional case where G = Br (K) and
ω = ar ωr we need to evaluate dim M12 . First let ar 6= 1. As above, Xr v 6= 0. This implies that
     2                                                            2
our values of r − m. By (1), this yields the assertion of the theorem for almost all ϕ ∈ Irrp .
It remains to consider the case where G = Br (K) and ω = ωr . It is well known that then the
restriction M ↓ H1 is a direct sum of 2r−m H1 -modules N = M (ωm ). Since km (x) = p, we get
kN (x) = p and nM (x) ≥ 2r−m > d(r − m).
    Now suppose that ϕ ∈ Irr \ Irr Nps. By thejSteinberg tensor product theorem [9, Theorem 1.1], ϕ
can be represented in the form j=1 ϕj Fr where Fr is the Frobenius morphism of G associated
with raising elements of K to the pth power and all ϕj ∈ Irrp . It is clear that the morphism
Fr does not influence the Jordan form of ϕ(x). Hence one can assume that ϕ = ψ ⊗ θ where
θ = ϕj Frj for some j and both ψ and θ are nontrivial. Set a = σx (ω(ψ)), ν = ω(ϕj ), b = τx (ν)
and define by µ the restriction of ν to TH . Now it follows from the definitions of σx and τx that
σx (ω) = a + b. By [11, Theorem 1.1, Lemma 2.5 and Proposition 2.12], kψ (x) = min{a + 1, p}
and kθ (x) = min{b + 1, p}. First suppose that a or b ≥ p − 1. Set ρ = ψ if a ≥ p − 1 and ρ = θ
otherwise and denote by π the remaining representation from the pair (ψ, θ). Then kρ (x) = p
and [4, ch. VIII, Lemma 2.2] implies that nϕ (x) ≥ dim π. Let d(r) be the value of d(r − m) if
one formally sets m = 0. Then by [5, Proposition 5.4.13], dim π ≥ d(r) > d(r − m) which settles
the case under consideration.
    Now assume that both a and b < p − 1. Then kψ (x) = a + 1 and kθ (x) = b + 1. Since
σx (ω) ≥ p − 1 + cx , we have b > cx . Arguing as for p-restricted ϕ, we can and shall suppose
              6 0 for some i ≤ (r + 1)/2 if G = Ar (K). Put M ′ = M (ν) and construct the
that hν, αi i =
composition factors Mi , i = 1, 2, of the restriction M ′ |H as for p-restricted M before. Transfer
the notation µ1 , λ1 , and Mji , i, j = 1, 2, to M ′ . Again we have the exceptional case G = Br (K)
and ν = ar ωr where we do not construct M2 and consider M1 only. Obviously, τx (µ1 ) = b. As
before, we deduce that τx (λ1 ) ≥ b − cx . By [11, Theorem 1.1, Lemma 2.5, and Proposition 2.12],
kM1 (x) = b + 1 and kM2 (x) ≥ b + 1 − cx . Let ni be the number of Jordan blocks of the maximal
size in the canonical form of x as an element of End Mi , i = 1, 2. Looking at the realizations
of Mi as tensor products, one easily observes that ni ≥ dim Mi2 . Set F1 = M (ω(ψ)) ⊗ M1 ,
F2 = M (ω(ψ)) ⊗ M2 and consider Fi as H-modules in the natural way. In the general case the
H-module M has a filtration two of whose quotients are isomorphic to F1 and F2 , respectively.
In the exceptional case F1 is a quotient of a submodule in M . Observe that a + kM2 (x) ≥ p.
Using [4, ch. VIII, Theorem 2.7] that describes the canonical Jordan form of a tensor product
of unipotent blocks, we obtain that kMi (x) = p and nFi (x) ≥ dim Mi2 . As for p-restricted M , we
show that n1 ≥ 2r−m if G = Br (K) and ν = ωr and conclude that dim M12 + dim M22 > d(r − m)
in the general case and dim M12 > d(r − m) in the exceptional cases with ar 6= 1. Now (1)
completes the proof.
Proof of Proposition 2.      Let a, x, m, and c be such as in the assertion of the proposition.
Assume that p < ac ≤ p + c − 1. Therefore we have (a − 1)c ≤ p − 1. Set M = M (ω) and denote
by Mt the weight subspace of weight t ∈ Z in the Γ-module M . It is clear that the Weyl L group
of Γ interchanges
      L            M  t and  M −t ; hence dim M  t = dim M  −t . Put e = (a − 1)c, V1 =   t>e Mt ,
V2 = t>e M−t , and V = Me . Set f = [(m + 1)/2] for G = Ar (K), f = m for G = Br (K) or
Cr (K), and f = m − 1 for G = Dr (K). Let v ∈ M be a nonzero highest weight vector and put
w = X−f . . . X−2 X−1 v. By [12, Lemma 2.9], w 6= 0. We need a subgroup S which can be defined
as follows. Put I = {i | 1 ≤ i ≤ r, δi = 0} and S = hXi , X−i | i ∈ Ii. The canonical Jordan
forms of x in the standard realizations of Gm and G are well known. We have |x| = p since the
dimension of the first realization is at most p due to our assumptions. Taking into account these
Jordan forms, one easily obtains the values of δi , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, and using Lemma 3, deduces the
following facts: I = {i | f + 1 ≤ i ≤ r − f } for G = Ar (K) and m = 2f , I = {i | f + 1 ≤ i ≤ r}
for G = Br (K) and Dr (K), and S = H2 in all other cases where H2 is the subgroup defined in
the proof of Theorem 1; cx = fi=1 δi = c, τx (ω) = ac; and w ∈ V . Next, observe that S ∼
                               P
                                                                                         = Ar−m
indecomposable S-module MS with highest weight ωS (w). Then one immediately concludes that
MS ∼ = M (ω1 ). This yields that dim MS = r − m + 1 = d(r − m) + 1 for G = Ar (K) and m = 2f ,
dim MS = 2(r − m) + 1 = d(r − m) + 1 for G = Br (K), dim MS = 2(r − m + 1) = d(r − m) + 2
for G = Dr (K), and dim MS = d(r − m) otherwise. It is clear that MS ⊂ V . Denote by
Xf ⊂ X(M ) the subset of weights of the form ω − fi=1 bi αi and by MA the irreducible Af (K)-
                                                      P
module with highest weight aω1 . By Smith’s theorem [8], for each µ ∈ Xf the dimension of the
weight subspace Mµ ⊂ M coincides with that of the weight subspace in MA whose weight differs
from aω1 by the sameL linear combination of the simple roots. Hence dim Mµ does not depend
upon r. Set W = µ∈Xf Mµ . Since M is an irreducible L-module and p > 2, observe that M
is a linear span of vectors of the form X−is . . . X−i2 X−i1 v. Now, analyzing the weight structure
of M , we conclude that V1 ⊂ W and V = (V ∩ W ) ⊕ MS . This implies that dim V1 (= dim V2 )
and dim(V ∩ W ) do not depend upon r.
    It follows from [10, Lemma 72] that
                                                        M
                                    (x − 1)p−1 Mt ⊂            Mi .                             (3)
                                                    i≥t+2p−2

Let Mt 6⊂ V2 . Then t ≥ −e. Obviously, e < p − 1 if ac < p − 1 + cx and e = p − 1 for
ac = p − 1 + cx . Thus (3) implies that
                                                 M
                                 (x − 1)p−1 Mt ⊂   Mt ⊂ V1
                                                   t>p−1

in the first case and
                                                 M
                               (x − 1)p−1 Mt ⊂           Mt ⊂ V1 ⊕ V
                                                 t≥p−1

in the second case. This forces that nM (x) ≤ dim V2 + dim V1 = 2 dim V1 in the first case
and nM (x) ≤ 2 dim V1 + dim(V ∩ W ) + dim MS in the second case. We have seen before that
dim MS = d(r − m) + u with u = 0, 1, or 2. Hence one can take NG (a, m, p) = 2 dim V1 and
QG (a, m, p) = 2 dim V1 + dim(V ∩ W ) + u to complete the proof.

Remark 4 For G = Ar (K) or Cr (K) we could give a shorter proof of Proposition 2 using the
realization of ϕ in the ath symmetric power of the standard module (see [7, 1.14 and 8.13]), but
we need the proof above for Br (K) and Dr (K).
