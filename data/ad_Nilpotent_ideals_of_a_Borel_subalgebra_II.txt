                                                   Abstract. We provide an explicit bijection between the ad-nilpotent ideals of a
                                                   Borel subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra g and the orbits of Q̌/(h + 1)Q̌ under the
                                                   Weyl group (Q̌ being the coroot lattice and h the Coxeter number of g). From this
                                                   result we deduce in a uniform way a counting formula for the ad-nilpotent ideals.

                                                Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra of rank n. Let b ⊂ g be a fixed Borel
                                             subalgebra, with Cartan component h, and let ∆+ be the positive system of the
                                             root system ∆ of g corresponding to the previous choice.
                                                                                               L       For each α ∈ ∆+ let gα
                                             denote the root space of g relative to α, and n =    gα , so that b = h ⊕ n.
                                                                                                     α∈∆+
                                                In this paper we continue the analysis, started in [CP1], of the set I of ad-
                                             nilpotent ideals of b, i.e. the ideals of b consisting of ad-nilpotent elements. These
                                             ideals are precisely the ideals of b which are contained in n; in particular the abelian
                                             ideals of b are ad-nilpotent.
                                                The abelian ideals of Borel subalgebras were studied by Kostant in [Ko1], [Ko2]
                                             in connection with representation theory of compact semisimple Lie groups, and
                                             very recently by Panyushev and Röhrle, [PR], in connection with the theory of
                                             spherical orbits. In particular, in [Ko2] Kostant detailed the following unpublished
                                             theorem of D. Peterson: the abelian ideals of b are 2n in number, independently of
                                             the type of g. In fact, Peterson gives a bijection between the abelian ideals of b and
                                             a certain set of elements of the affine Weyl group W  c of g. This leads to look for a
                                             similar result for all ad-nilpotent ideals. In [CP1] we showed how to associate to
                                             any ideal i in I a uniquely determined element wi in W    c , and we characterized the
                                             set {wi | i ∈ I} inside Wc . In this paper we develop our previous result and prove
                                             the following Theorem.
                                                Let W denote the Weyl group of g, and Q, Q̌ be the root and coroot lattices,
                                             respectively. Moreover let h be the Coxeter number of W and e1 , . . . , en be the
                                             exponents of W [Hu, Section 3.19]. We consider the natural action of W on Q̌/(h +

Theorem 1. There exists an explicit bijection between the set of ad-nilpotent ideals
of b and the set of W -orbits in Q̌/(h + 1)Q̌. In particular the number of the ad-
nilpotent ideals of b is
                                      n
                                 1 Y
                                         (h + ei + 1).                           (1)
                                |W | i=1

The fact that formula (1) counts W -orbits in Q̌/(h + 1)Q̌ follows from a Theorem
of M. Haiman [Ha, Theorem 7.4.4].
   As we shall recall in Section 4, the ad-nilpotent ideals of b are naturally in
bijection with the antichains of the root poset (∆+ , ≤), hence with the ⊕–sign
          ˇ and with the regions of the Catalan hyperplane arrangement which
types of ∆,
are contained in the fundamental chamber of W . So our result affords a uniform
enumeration for all these objects. In particular, it answers the question raised in
[S, Remark 3.7] regarding the (uniform) enumeration of sign types.
   Formula (1) for the ad-nilpotent ideals already appears at the end of the Intro-
duction of [KOP], where the authors asked for a proof of it avoiding case by case
inspection. Our main Theorem also improves the known results on the Catalan
arrangement extending to any root system the enumeration formula (1), which was
proved by Athanasiadis for the classical systems [At1], [At2].
   We remark that Sommers [So] gives a generalization of formula (1), expressing
the Euler characteristic of the space of partial flags containing a certain regular
semisimple nil-elliptic element nt in an affine Lie algebra.
   Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section we fix notation and recall
some basic facts about affine Weyl groups. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1 after
recalling the results of [CP1] which are needed for the proof. In Section 4 we briefly
recall the known bijections between ad-nilpotent ideals, antichains of the root poset
(∆+ , ≤), ⊕–sign types of ∆,ˇ and regions of the Catalan hyperplane arrangement
contained in the fundamental chamber. In Section 5 we illustrate the bijection of
Theorem 1 for the root types A2 and B2 .

                          §2 Notation and preliminaries

                                                                              L
                                                                              n
    Let Π = {α1 , . . . , αn } be the simple roots of ∆+ . We set V ≡ h∗R =         Rαi and
                                                                              i=1
denote by ( , ) the positive symmetric bilinear form induced on V by the Killing
form. We describe the affine root system associated to ∆ as follows [Kac, Chapter
6]. We extend V and its inner product setting Vb = V ⊕ Rδ ⊕ Rλ, (δ, δ) = (δ, V ) =
(λ, λ) = (λ, V ) = 0, and (δ, λ) = 1. We still denote by ( , ) the resulting (non-
degenerate) bilinear form. The affine root system associated to ∆ is ∆b = ∆ + Zδ =
{α+kδ | α ∈ ∆, k ∈ Z}; remark that the affine roots are non-isotropic vectors. The
                                b + = (∆+ + Nδ) ∪ (∆− + N+ δ), where ∆− = −∆+ .
set of positive affine roots is ∆
We denote by θ the highest root of ∆ and set α0 = −θ + δ, Π  b = {α0 , . . . , αn }. For
each α ∈ ∆ b + we denote by sα the corresponding reflection of Vb ; the affine Weyl
group associated to ∆ is the group W   c generated by {sα | α ∈ ∆  b + }. Note that
w(δ) = δ for each w ∈ W  c.
   c is a semidirect product T ⋊ W , where T = {tτ | τ ∈ Q̌} ∼
   W                                                           = Q̌ is the subgroup
                                                    −1
of translations, and the action of W on T is vtτ v      = tv(τ ) . The action of tτ

on V ⊕ Rδ, in particular on the roots, is given by tτ (x) = x − (x, τ )δ, for each
x ∈ V ⊕ Rδ. (See [Kac] for the general definition of tτ on Vb ).
                 c -invariant affine subspace E = {x ∈ V | (x, δ) = 1} = V ⊕Rδ +λ.
    Consider the W
Let π : E → V + λ be the natural projection. For w ∈ W    c we set w = π ◦ w|V +λ .
Then the map w 7→ w is injective. We identify V + λ with V through the natural
projection. In this way w 7→ w induces an isomorphism of W   c onto a group Waf of
affine transformations of V , which is in fact the usual affine representation of the
affine Weyl group [B, VI, §2]. For v ∈ W , v is simply the restriction of v to V , so
we omit the bar. For τ ∈ Q̌, tτ is the true translation by τ .
    For k ∈ N+ , we set
                            Ck = {x ∈ C∞ | (x, θ) < k},

                  C∞ = {x ∈ V | (x, αi ) > 0 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}}.

C∞ is the fundamental chamber of W in V , and C1 is the fundamental alcove of
Waf in V . The closures C ∞ , C 1 are fundamental domains for the actions on V of
W, Waf respectively.
    As usual we denote by {ω̌1 , . . . , ω̌n } the dual basis of {α1 , . . . , αn } and we set
oi = ω̌i /mi , where θ = m1 α1 + · · · + mn αn . For each k ∈ N+ , C k (= kC 1 ) is the
simplex whose vertices are 0, ko1 , . . . , kon .
          k                                       k
    Let T = {tτ | τ ∈ k Q̌} and set Wk = T ⋊ W . Note that Wk is the affine Weyl
group of k1 ∆ and Ck is its fundamental chamber with respect to k1 Π. In particular,
Q̌ ∩ C k is a set of representatives of the orbits of Q̌ under the natural action of Wk .
For τ ∈ Q̌, consider its orbit Wk (τ ). We have Wk (τ ) = W (τ ) + k Q̌ = W (τ + k Q̌),
hence the orbits of of Q̌ under Wk naturally correspond to the orbits of Q̌/k Q̌ under
the action of W [Ha]. In fact, in order to prove Theorem 1, we shall prove that I
is in bijection with Q̌ ∩ C h+1 .

                               §3 Proof of Theorem 1

   In [CP1] we found an explicit encoding of the elements of I by means of certain
elements of Wc . We briefly recall this result. By definition any ad-nilpotent ideal i
of b is included in n. Such an ideal i is, in particular, ad(h)-stable, so there exists
                           L
Φi ⊆ ∆+ such that i =          gα . We set Φ1i = Φi and Φk+1 i    = (Φki + Φi ) ∩ ∆+ ,
                          α∈Φi
                            L
for each k ∈ N+ , so that       gα equals i(k) , the k-th element of the descending
                              α∈Φk
                                 i
central S
        series of i. Then we associate to i the following set of positive affine roots:
Li =      (−Φki + kδ). In [CP1, Proposition 2.4] we proved that there exists a
       k≥1
(unique) wi ∈ Wc such that Li = N (wi ) = {α ∈ ∆ b + | w−1 (α) < 0}. Then i 7→ wi is
                                                        i
the required encoding. We remark that wi is explicitly determined by Li . We also
gave the following characterization, which will play a crucial role in the sequel.
                                               c . Then w = wi for some i ∈ I
Proposition 1. [CP1, Proposition 2.12] Let w ∈ W
if and only if the following conditions hold:
   (a) w−1 (α) > 0 for each α ∈ Π;
                                b then w(α) = β − δ for some β ∈ ∆+ .
   (b) if w(α) < 0 for some α ∈ Π,
4                              PAOLA CELLINI PAOLO PAPI

   For α ∈ ∆+ and l ∈ Z set Hα,l = {x ∈ V | (x, α) = l}. We recall that, for
α ∈ ∆+ , l ∈ N+ , m ∈ N, w ∈ Wc , we have w−1 (−α + lδ) < 0 if and only if Hα,l
separates C1 and w(C1 ), and w−1 (α + mδ) < 0 if and only if Hα,−m separates C1
and w(C1 ). From Proposition 1 we obtain the following characterization.
Proposition 2. Let w ∈ W        c , w = tτ v, τ ∈ Q̌, v ∈ W . Set βi = v(αi ) for
i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Then w = wi for some i ∈ I if and only if the following conditions
hold:
     (i) w(C1 ) ⊂ C∞ ;
    (ii) (τ, βi ) ≤ 1 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (τ, v(θ)) ≥ −2.
Proof. It is clear that condition (a) of Proposition 1 is equivalent to w(C1 ) ⊂ C∞ .
   Assume w = wi for some i ∈ I. Then (i) holds and this implies, in particular,
that τ ∈ C ∞ . Since βi ∈ ∆, if βi < 0 then (τ, βi ) ≤ 0. So we may assume βi > 0.
We have w(αi ) = βi − (τ, βi )δ, hence if (τ, βi ) > 0 we obtain w(αi ) < 0. Then by
Proposition 1 w(αi ) = βi − δ and thus (τ, βi) = 1. Then we consider v(θ). We
have w(α0 ) = −v(θ) + ((τ, v(θ)) + 1)δ. If (τ, v(θ)) < −1, then w(α0 ) < 0, hence by
Proposition 1 (τ, v(θ)) + 1 = −1, hence (τ, v(θ)) = −2.
   Conversely, assume that (i) and (ii) hold. Then condition (a) of Proposition
1 holds. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ n and w(αi ) < 0. Then either (τ, βi ) > 0, or (τ, βi ) = 0
and βi < 0. The latter case cannot occur, otherwise, for x ∈ C1 we would have
(w(x), βi ) = (v(x), βi ) = (x, αi ) > 0, which is impossible, since w(x) belongs to
C ∞ and βi is negative. So we have (τ, βi ) > 0, hence, by assumption (τ, βi ) = 1, so
that w(αi ) = βi − δ. Finally assume w(α0 ) < 0. Then either (τ, v(θ)) + 1 < 0, or
(τ, v(θ)) + 1 = 0 and v(θ) > 0. As above we see that the latter case cannot occur,
so, by assumption, (τ, v(θ)) = −2. This implies v(θ) < 0 and w(α0 ) = −v(θ) − δ,
hence the claim. 
    Set
          D = {τ ∈ Q̌ | (τ, αi) ≤ 1 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (τ, θ) ≥ −2}.
Assume wi = tτi vi for some i ∈ I, τi ∈ Q̌, vi ∈ W . Then by Proposition 2 we have
(τi , βj ) ≤ 1 for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (τi , vi (θ)) ≥ −2, hence (vi−1 (τi ), αj ) ≤ 1 for
each j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (vi−1 (τi ), θ) ≥ −2. It follows that tτi vi 7→ vi−1 (τi ) is a map
from {wi | i ∈ I} to D.
Proposition 3. The map F : wi = tτi vi 7→ vi−1 (τi ) is a bijection between
{wi | i ∈ I} and D.
Proof. Set, for notational simplicity, wi = tτ v, wj = tσ u for some i and j in I,
τ, σ ∈ Q̌ and v, u ∈ W . Assume v −1 (τ ) = u−1 (σ). Since τ, σ ∈ C ∞ , which is a
fundamental domain for W , we           τ = σ and vu−1 (τ ) = τ . Hence tτ v(C1 ) =
                                  have −1
     −1             −1
tτ vu u(C1 ) = vu       tτ u(C1 ) = vu       tσ u(C1 ) ⊂ vu−1 (C∞ ). But tτ v(C1 ) ⊂
C∞ , hence vu−1 = 1. Thus F is injective. Next let σ ∈ D. We first see that there
exists v ∈ W such that tv(σ) v(C1 ) ⊂ C∞ : simply take the unique v ∈ W such
that v(σ + C1 ) ⊂ C∞ . Now it is immediate that, since σ ∈ D, tv(σ) v also satisfies
condition (ii) of Proposition 2, hence tv(σ) v = wi for some i in I. It is obvious that
F maps tv(σ) v to σ, thus F is surjective. 
Remark. In a forthcoming paper [CP2] we provide characterizations for the ele-
ments of D corresponding through F to abelian ideals and, among them, for those
encoding maximal abelian ideals.

translation by τ . As usual, we set f = [Waf : Waf ] = [P̌ : Q̌].
Lemma 1. Assume that k and f are relatively prime. Then for each w′ ∈ Waf           ′

Proof. Let θ = i=1 mi αi and J = {i | mi = 1}. By [IM, Sections 1.7 and 1.8],

Ck = tkω̌j w0j w0 (Ck ), where w0 is the longest element of W and w0j is the longest
element in the maximal parabolic subgroup of W generated by the reflections with

w′ = tσ with σ ∈ P̌ . Then we have w′ (Ck ) = tσ (Ck ) = tσ+kω̌j w0j w0 (Ck ), for
each j ∈ J. If k and f are relatively prime, then {0} ∪ {k ω̌j | j ∈ J} and hence
{σ} ∪ {σ + k ω̌j | j ∈ J} still are sets of representatives of P̌ /Q̌. It follows that
exactly one element in {σ} ∪ {σ + k ω̌j | j ∈ J} belongs to Q̌, hence one among tσ ,
tσ+kω̌j w0j w0 , j ∈ J, belongs to Waf . 
Remark. A direct check shows that the prime divisors of f also divide the Coxeter
number of W . Hence the assumption of Lemma 1 is satisfied by any integer k
relatively prime to h.
Theorem 1. I is in bijection with the orbits of Q̌/(h + 1)Q̌ under W .
Proof. Let X = {x ∈ V | (x, αi ) ≤ 1 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (x, θ) ≥ −2} and
ρ̌ = ω̌1 + · · · + ω̌n be the half sum of positive coroots. We have that (ρ̌, θ) = h − 1,
thus X is the simplex whose vertices are ρ̌ and ρ̌ − (h + 1)oi , for i = 1, . . . , n. Hence
X = tρ̌ w0 (C h+1 ). By Lemma 1 and the above Remark there exists w ∈ Waf such
that X = w(C h+1 ). Such a w gives a bijection from C h+1 ∩ Q̌ to D = X ∩ Q̌. If
i ∈ I and wi = tτi vi , with τi ∈ Q̌ and vi ∈ W , then, using Proposition 3, we obtain
that w−1 vi−1 (τi ) belongs to C h+1 ∩ Q̌ and i 7→ w−1 vi−1 (τi ) is a bijection between
I and C h+1 ∩ Q̌. This concludes the proof, since, as we observed in Section 2, the
cosets of the elements in C h+1 ∩ Q̌ are a natural set of representatives of the orbits
of Q̌/(h + 1)Q̌ under the action of W . 

   We can explicitly determine the element w which appears in the above proof.
Indeed we shall compute w−1 . If ρ̌ ∈ Q̌, then trivially w−1 = w0 t−ρ̌ . Otherwise,
according to the proofs of Lemma 1 and of Theorem 1, there exists a unique j ∈ J
such that the vertex ρ̌ − (h + 1)oj = ρ̌ − (h + 1)ω̌j of X belongs to Q̌. Now observe
that w0j maps {αi | i 6= j} to {−αi | i 6= j} and maps αj and θ into positive roots.
For any root α let ht(α) = (α, ρ̌) be the height of α. Then ht(θ) = h − 1, and, since
j ∈ J, ht(w0j (θ)) = ht(w0j (αj )) − (h − 2). Since w0j (θ) is positive this implies that
ht(w0j (αj )) = h − 1, hence w0j (αj ) = θ and w0j (θ) = αj . It is easily seen that this
implies that w0j t−ρ̌+(h+1)ω̌j (X) = C h+1 . Hence in order to determine w it suffices
to determine the above j.
   Numbering the fundamental weights as in [B], by a direct computation we obtain:
   An : ρ̌ ∈ Q̌ for n even; j = n+1
                                 2 for n odd.
   Bn : ρ̌ ∈ Q̌ for n ≡ 0, 3 mod 4; j = 1 for n ≡ 1, 2 mod 4.
   Cn : j = n.

                              §4 The other bijections

(1) A bijection between ad-nilpotent ideals of b and antichains of the root poset.
In Section 3 we observed that any ad-nilpotent
                                      L          ideal of b is a sum of (positive)
                        +
root spaces. For Φ ⊆ ∆ , set iΦ =        gα . If iΦ is an ideal of b, then α ∈ Φ,
                                          α∈Φ
β ∈ ∆+ , α + β ∈ ∆ implies P      α + β ∈ Φ. If we endow ∆+ with the usual partial
order (i.e. α ≤ β if β − α = γ∈∆+ cγ γ, cγ ∈ N), then, by definition, Φ is a dual
order ideal of (∆+ , ≤).
    It is a general fact that, in a finite poset P , dual order ideals and antichains (i.e.
sets consisting of pairwise non-comparable elements) are in canonical bijection:
map the antichain {a1 , . . . , ak } to the dual order ideal which is the union of the
principal dual order ideals Va1 , . . . , Vak , where Va = {b ∈ P | b ≥ a}; the inverse
map sends a dual order ideal into the set of its minimal elements. It is clear that
iΦ 7→ Φ is the required bijection.
Remark. In combinatorial literature the antichains of the root poset (∆+ , ≤) are
called nonnesting partitions [R, Remark 2]. This name derives from the analysis of
the definition in type An . In that case, write the positive roots with respect to the
standard basis {εi }n+1
                      i=1 of R
                                n+1
                                    , so that ∆+ = {εi − εj | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + 1}. Then
to an antichain A we can associate a partition of {1, . . . , n + 1} by putting in the
same block i, j whenever εi − εj ∈ A. It turns out that partitions arising in this
way are the ones characterized by the following property: if a, e appear in a block
B and b, d appear in a different block B ′ where a < b < d < e, then there exists
c ∈ B satisfying b < c < d.
(2) A bijection between antichains of the root poset and ⊕-sign types of ∆    ˇ or regions
of the Catalan arrangement which are contained in the fundamental chamber.
    First we recall the definition of ⊕-sign type for the root system ∆. For α ∈ ∆+
set Hα,+ = {v ∈ V | (v, α̌) > 1}, Hα,0 = {v ∈ V | 0 < (v, α̌) < 1}, Hα,− = {v ∈
V | (v, α̌) < 0}.
               T Then a subset S ⊂ V is a sign type (resp. ⊕-sign type) if it is of the
form S =           Hα,Xα for some collection (Xα )α∈∆+ with Xα ∈ {+, 0, −} (resp.
            α∈∆+
Xα ∈ {+, 0}).
   We describe a bijection between dual order ideals and ⊕-sign types, according
to Shi [S, Theorem 1.4]. Given a dual order ideal Φ ⊆ ∆+ , map it to the ⊕-sign
              ˇ + defined by
type (Xα̌ )α̌∈∆
                                   
                                     0,    if α ∈
                                                /Φ
                             Xα̌ =
                                     +,    if α ∈ Φ.
This bijection appears also in a different context. Recall the two following remark-
able arrangements of real hyperplanes (cf. [At2, §3]). The Shi arrangement S,
relative to ∆, is the set of hyperplanes of V having equations
                       (x, α) = 0,      (x, α) = 1,      α ∈ ∆+ ;
the Catalan arrangement C is the set of hyperplanes of V having equations
              (x, α) = 0,      (x, α) = 1,      (x, α) = −1,        α ∈ ∆+ .

We call regions of the hyperplane arrangement the connected components of the
complement in V of the union of all hyperplanes in the arrangement. By the
definition of S and C it is clear that both arrangements have the same number of
regions inside the fundamental chamber of W . A bijection between antichains in
∆+ and regions of S or C lying in the fundamental chamber (which in [At1, 6.1]
is attributed to Postnikov) can be made explicit mapping an antichain A to the
region

                            (β, x) < 1             otherwise

  We illustrate the above bijections in the easy case of a root system of type A2 .

Remark. It is worthwhile to recall that formula (1) also counts the number of
conjugacy classes of elements of order dividing h + 1 in a maximal torus T of the
connected simply connected simple algebraic group G corresponding to g. Indeed
these classes are in bijection with W -orbits on Q̌/r Q̌. In fact, regard coroots as
cocharacters of T , i.e. as morphism of algebraic groups C∗ → T . Fix a primitive
r-th root of unity z; then, given τ ∈ Q̌, the map τ 7→ τ (z) is bijection from Q̌/r Q̌
to Tr = {t ∈ T | tr = 1} and induces a bijection between the W -orbits in Q̌/r Q̌
and the conjugacy classes of elements in Tr .


                                          §5 Examples

   We illustrate the bijection of Theorem 1 when ∆ is of type A2 or B2 . For this
purpose we first need to give explicitly the elements wi ∈ Wc corresponding to the
ideals i ∈ I.
   In the case of A2 the map from I into W c is given as follows.

      i4 = gα2 ⊕ gθ             {−θ + δ, −α2 + δ}                           s0 s1

We have h = 3 and Q̌ = Q = Zα1 ⊕ Zα2 ; we have also ρ̌ = ρ = θ = α1 + α2 . The
bijections of Proposition 3 and Theorem 1 look as follows (regarding the bijection
of Theorem 1, we write down the element of C h+1 ∩ Q̌ corresponding to each ideal).


                    wi = tτi vi                vi−1 (τi )         w0 t−ρ̌ (vi−1 (τi ))


                    1                          0                  θ
                    s 0 = tθ s 1 s 2 s 1        −θ                2θ
                    s 0 s 2 = tθ s 2 s 1        − α1              α1 + 2α2
                    s 0 s 1 = tθ s 1 s 2       − α2               2α1 + α2
                    s 0 s 1 s 2 s 1 = tθ       θ                  0

    Now we consider the root type B2 . Here h = 4, and Q̌ = Zα1 + 2Zα2 . Then
ρ̌ = 2α1 + 3α2 ∈/ Q̌, but ω̌1 = α1 + α2 so that ρ̌ − 5ω̌1 = −3α1 − 2α2 ∈ Q̌. Moreover,
in the notation of the proof of Theorem 1, w0j = w01 = s2 . The injection of I in Wc
is given as follows (for shortness we don’t write N (wi )).


                   i1 = 0                                   wi1 = 1
                   i2 = gθ                                  wi2 = s0
                   i3 = gα1 +α2 ⊕ gθ                        wi3 = s0 s2
                   i4 = gα1 ⊕ gα1 +α2 ⊕ gθ                  wi4 = s0 s2 s0
                   i5 = gα2 ⊕ gα1 +α2 ⊕ gθ                  wi5 = s0 s2 s1 s2

    The bijection with C h+1 ∩ Q̌ is obtained in the following table.
