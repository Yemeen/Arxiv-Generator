                                                  One of the central theorems of harmonic analysis on R is the Paley-Wiener
                                             theorem which characterizes the class of functions on C which are Fourier
                                             transforms of C ∞ -functions on R with compact support (also called the Paley-
                                             Wiener-Schwartz theorem; see [18, p. 249]). We consider the analogous ques-
                                             tion for the Fourier transform of a reductive symmetric space X = G/H, that
                                             is, G is a real reductive Lie group of Harish-Chandra’s class and H is an open
                                             subgroup of the group Gσ of fixed points for an involution σ of G.
                                                  The paper is a continuation of [4] and [6], in which we have shown that
                                             the Fourier transform is injective on Cc∞ (X), and established an inversion
                                             formula for the K-finite functions in this space, with K a σ-stable maximal
                                             compact subgroup of G. A conjectural image of the space of K-finite functions

in Cc∞ (X) was described in [4, Rem. 21.8], and will be confirmed in the present
paper (the conjecture was already confirmed for symmetric spaces of split rank
one in [4]).
      If G/H is a Riemannian symmetric space (equivalently, if H is compact),
there is a well established theory of harmonic analysis (see [17]), and the Paley-
Wiener theorem that we obtain generalizes a well known theorem of Helgason
and Gangolli ([15]; see also [17, Thm. IV,7.1]). Furthermore, the reductive
group G is a symmetric space in its own right, for the left times right action
of G × G. Also in this ‘case of the group’ there is an established theory of
harmonic analysis, and our theorem generalizes the theorem of Arthur [1] (and
Campoli [11] for groups of split rank one).
      The Fourier transform F that we are dealing with is defined for functions
in the space Cc∞ (X : τ ) of τ -spherical Cc∞ -functions on X. Here τ is a finite
dimensional representation of K, and a τ -spherical function on X is a function
that has values in the representation space Vτ and satisfies f (kx) = τ (k)f (x)
for all x ∈ X, k ∈ K. This space is a convenient tool for the study of K-finite
(scalar) functions on X. Related to τ and the (minimal) principal series for X,
there is a family E ◦ (ψ : λ) of normalized Eisenstein integrals on X (cf. [2], [3]).
These are (normalized) generalizations of the elementary spherical functions
for Riemannian symmetric spaces, as well as of Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein
integrals associated with a minimal parabolic subgroup of a semisimple Lie
group. The Eisenstein integral is a τ -spherical smooth function on X. It
is linear in the parameter ψ, which belongs to a finite dimensional Hilbert
space ◦ C, and meromorphic in λ, which belongs to the complex linear dual a∗qC
of a maximal abelian subspace aq of p ∩ q. Here p is the orthocomplement of k
in g, and q is the orthocomplement of h in g, where g, k and h are the Lie algebras
of G, K and H. The Fourier transform Ff of a function f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) is
essentially defined by integration of f against E ◦ (see (2.1)), and is a ◦ C-valued
meromorphic function of λ ∈ a∗qC . The fact that Ff (λ) is meromorphic in λ,
rather than holomorphic, represents a major complication not present in the
mentioned special cases.
      The Paley-Wiener theorem (Thm. 3.6) asserts that F maps Cc∞ (X : τ )
onto the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) (Def. 3.4), which is a space of mero-
morphic functions a∗qC → ◦ C characterized by an exponential growth condition
and so-called Arthur-Campoli relations, which are conditions coming from re-
lations of a particular type among the Eisenstein integrals. These relations
generalize the relations used in [11] and [1]. Among the relations are conditions
for transformation under the Weyl group (Lemma 3.10). In the Riemannian
case, no other relations are needed, but this is not so in general.
      The proof is based on the inversion formula f = T Ff of [6], through
which a function f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) is determined from its Fourier transform by
an operator T . The same operator can be applied to an arbitrary function ϕ in
      A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                       881

the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ). The resulting function T ϕ on X, called a
pseudo wave packet, is then shown to have ϕ as its Fourier transform. A priori ,
T ϕ is defined and smooth on a certain dense open subset X+ of X, and the
main difficulty in the proof is to show that it admits a smooth extension to X
(Thm. 4.4). In fact, as was shown already in [6], if a smooth extension of T ϕ
exists, then this extension has compact support and is mapped onto ϕ by F.
     The proof that T ϕ extends smoothly relies on the residue calculus of [5]
and on results of [7]. By means of the residue calculus we write the pseudo
wave packet T ϕ in the form
                                        X
                                 Tϕ=        TF ϕ
                                         F ⊂∆
(see eq. (8.3)) in which ∆ is a set of simple roots for the root system of aq , and in
which the individual terms for F 6= ∅ are defined by means of residue operators.
The term T∅ ϕ is the wave packet given by integration over a∗q of ϕ against the
normalized Eisenstein integral. The smooth extension of T ϕ is established by
showing that each term TF ϕ extends smoothly. The latter fact is obtained
by identification of TF ϕ with a wave packet formed by generalized Eisenstein
integrals. The generalized Eisenstein integrals we use were introduced in [6];
they are smooth functions on X. It is shown in [9] that they are matrix
coefficients of nonminimal principal series representations and that they agree
with the generalized Eisenstein integrals of [12]. However, these facts play
no role here. It is for the identification of TF ϕ as a wave packet that the
Arthur-Campoli relations are needed when F 6= ∅. An important step is to
show that Arthur-Campoli relations for lower dimensional symmetric spaces,
related to certain parabolic subgroups in G, can be induced up to Arthur-
Campoli relations for X (Thm. 6.2). For this step we use a result from [7].
     As mentioned, our Paley-Wiener theorem generalizes that of Arthur [1] for
the group case. Arthur also uses residue calculus in the spirit of [19], but apart
from that our approach differs in a number of ways, the following two being
the most significant. Firstly, Arthur relies on Harish-Chandra’s Plancherel
theorem for the group, whereas we do not need the analogous theorem for X,
which has been established by Delorme [14] and the authors [8], [9]. Secondly,
Arthur’s result involves unnormalized Eisenstein integrals, whereas our involves
normalized ones. This facilitates comparison between the Eisenstein integrals
related to X and those related to lower rank symmetric spaces coming from
parabolic subgroups. For similar comparison of the unnormalized Eisenstein
integrals, Arthur relies on a lifting principle of Casselman, the proof of which
has not been published. In [7] we have established a normalized version of
Casselman’s principle which plays a crucial role in the present work. One can
show, using [16, Lemma 2, p. 156], [1, Lemma I.5.1] and [13], that our Paley-
Wiener theorem, specialized to the group case, implies Arthur’s. In fact, it
implies a slightly stronger result, since here only Arthur-Campoli relations for
882                  E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


real-valued parameters λ are needed, whereas the Paley-Wiener theorem of [1]
requires also the relations at the complex-valued λ.
     The Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) is defined in Section 3 (Definition 3.4),
and the proof outlined above that it equals the Fourier image of Cc∞ (X : τ )
takes up the following Sections 4–8. A priori the given definition of PW(X : τ )
does not match that of [4], but it is shown in the final Sections 9, 10 that the
two spaces are equal.
     The main result of this paper was found and announced in the fall of 1995
when both authors were visitors of the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm,
Sweden. We are grateful to the organizers of the program and the staff of the
institute for providing us with this opportunity, and to Mogens Flensted-Jensen
for helpful discussions during that period.

                                   2. Notation

      We use the same notation and basic assumptions as in [4, §§2, 3, 5, 6],
and [6, §2]. Only the most essential notions will be recalled, and we refer to
the mentioned locations for unexplained notation.
      We denote by Σ the root system of aq in g, where aq is a maximal abelian
subspace of p ∩ q, as mentioned in the introduction. Each positive system Σ+ for
Σ determines a parabolic subgroup P = M1 N , where M1 is the centralizer of aq
in G and N is the exponential of n, the sum of the positive root spaces. In what
follows we assume that such a positive system Σ+ has been fixed. Moreover,
notation with reference to Σ+ or P , as given in [4] and [6], is supposed to refer
to this fixed choice, if nothing else is mentioned. For example, we write a+    q for
the corresponding positive open Weyl chamber in aq , denoted a+    q (P ) in [4], and
  +                         +
Aq for its exponential Aq (P ) in G. We write P = M AN for the Langlands
decomposition of P .
      Throughout the paper we fix a finite dimensional unitary representation
(τ, Vτ ) of K, and we denote by ◦ C = ◦ C(τ ) the finite dimensional space defined
by [4, eq. (5.1)]. The Eisenstein integral E(ψ : λ) = E(P : ψ : λ) : X → Vτ is
defined as in [4, eq. (5.4)], and the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (ψ : λ) =
E ◦ (P : ψ : λ) is defined as in [4, p. 283]. Both Eisenstein integrals belong to
C ∞ (X : τ ) and depend linearly on ψ ∈ ◦ C and meromorphically on λ ∈ a∗qC .
For x ∈ X we denote the linear map ◦ C ∋ ψ 7→ E ◦ (ψ : λ : x) ∈ Vτ by E ◦ (λ : x),
and we define E ∗ (λ : x) ∈ Hom(Vτ , ◦ C) to be the adjoint of E ◦ (−λ̄ : x) (see [6,
eq. (2.3)]). The Fourier transform that we investigate maps f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) to
the meromorphic function Ff on a∗qC given by
                                  Z
(2.1)                    Ff (λ) =     E ∗ (λ : x)f (x) dx ∈ ◦ C.
                                   X
      The open dense set X+ ⊂ X is given by
                              X+ = ∪w∈W KA+
                                          q wH;

see [6, eq. (2.1)]. It naturally arises in connection with the study of asymptotic
expansions of the Eisenstein integrals; see [6, p. 32, 33]. As a result of this
theory, the normalized Eisenstein integral is decomposed as a finite sum
                        X
(2.2) E ◦ (λ : x) =        E+,s (λ : x),     E+,s (λ : x) = E+ (sλ : x) ◦ C ◦ (s : λ)
                     s∈W

for x ∈ X+ , all ingredients being meromorphic in λ ∈ a∗qC . The partial Eisen-
stein integral E+ (λ : x) is a Hom(◦ C, Vτ )-valued function in x ∈ X+ , given by
a converging series expansion, and C ◦ (s : λ) ∈ End(◦ C) is the (normalized)
c-function associated with τ . In general, x 7→ E+ (λ : x) is singular along
X \ X+ . The c-function also appears in the following transformation law for
the action of the Weyl group
(2.3)                    E ∗ (sλ : x) = C ◦ (s : λ) ◦ E ∗ (λ : x)
for all s ∈ W and x ∈ X (see [6, eq. (2.11)]), from which it follows that
(2.4)                      Ff (sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ) ◦ Ff (λ).
     The structure of the singular set for the meromorphic functions E ◦ ( · : x)
and E+ ( · : x) on a∗qC plays a crucial role. To describe it, we recall from [7, §10],
that a Σ-configuration in a∗qC is a locally finite collection of affine hyperplanes
H of the form
(2.5)                         H = {λ | hλ, αH i = sH }
where αH ∈ Σ and sH ∈ C. Furthermore, we recall from [7, §11], that if H is
a Σ-configuration in a∗qC and d a map H → N, we define for each bounded set
ω ⊂ a∗qC a polynomial function πω,d on a∗qC by
                                  Y
(2.6)              πω,d (λ) =           (hλ, αH i − sH )d(H) ,
                                H∈H,H∩ω6=∅

where αH , sH are as above. The linear space M(a∗qC , H, d) is defined to be the
space of meromorphic functions ϕ : a∗qC → C, for which πω,d ϕ is holomorphic
on ω for all bounded open sets ω ⊂ a∗qC , and the linear space M(a∗qC , H) is
defined by taking the union of M(a∗qC , H, d) over d ∈ NH . If H is real, that is,
sH ∈ R for all H, we write M(a∗q , H, d) and M(a∗q , H) in place of M(a∗qC , H, d)
and M(a∗qC , H).

     Lemma 2.1. There exists a real Σ-configuration H such that the mero-
morphic functions E ◦ ( · : x) and E+,s ( · : x′ ) belong to M(a∗q , H)⊗Hom(◦ C, Vτ )
for all x ∈ X, x′ ∈ X+ , s ∈ W , and such that C ◦ (s : · ) ∈ M(a∗q , H) ⊗ End(◦ C)
for all s ∈ W .

     Proof. The statement for E ◦ ( · : x) is proved in [6, Prop. 3.1], and the
statement for E+,1 ( · : x) = E+ ( · : x) is proved in [6, Lemma 3.3]. The state-
ment about C ◦ (s : · ) follows from [3, eqs. (68), (57)], by the argument given
884                  E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


below the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [6]. The statement for E+,s ( · : x) in general
then follows from its definition in (2.2).
     Let H = H(X, τ ) denote the collection of the singular hyperplanes for all
λ 7→ E ∗ (λ : x), x ∈ X (this is a real Σ-configuration, by the preceding lemma).
Moreover, for H ∈ H let d(H) = dX,τ (H) be the least integer l ≥ 0 for which
λ 7→ (hλ, αH i − sH )l E ∗ (λ : x) is regular along H \ ∪{H ′ ∈ H | H ′ 6= H}, for
all x ∈ X. Then E ∗ ( · : x) ∈ M(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , ◦ C) and d is minimal with
this property. It follows that Ff ∈ M(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C for all f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ).
     There is more to say about these singular sets. For R ∈ R we define
(2.7)           a∗q (P, R) = {λ ∈ a∗qC | ∀α ∈ Σ+ : Rehλ, αi < R}
and denote by ā∗q (P, R) the closure of this set. Then it also follows from
[6, Prop. 3.1 and Lemma 3.3], that E ∗ ( · : x) and E+ ( · : x) both have the
property that for each R only finitely many singular hyperplanes meet a∗q (P, R).
     In particular, the set of affine hyperplanes
(2.8)               H0 = {H ∈ H(X, τ ) | H ∩ ā∗q (P, 0) 6= ∅},
is finite. Let π be the real polynomial function on a∗qC given by
                                 Y
(2.9)                  π(λ) =       (hλ, αH i − sH )dX,τ (H)
                               H∈H0

where αH and sH are chosen as in (2.5). The polynomial π coincides, up to a
constant nonzero factor, with the polynomial denoted by the same symbol in
[4, eq. (8.1)], and in [6, p. 34]. It has the property that there exists ε > 0 such
that λ 7→ π(λ)E ∗ (λ : x) is holomorphic on a∗q (P, ε) for all x ∈ X.

              3. The Paley-Wiener space. Main theorem
     We define the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) for the pair (X, τ ) and state
the main theorem, that the Fourier transform maps Cc∞ (X : τ ) onto this space.
     First we set up the condition that reflects relations among Eisenstein
integrals. In [11] and [1] similar relations are used in the definition of the
Paley-Wiener space. However, as we are dealing with functions that are in
general meromorphic rather than holomorphic, our relations have to be spec-
ified somewhat differently. This is done by means of Laurent functionals, a
concept introduced in [7, Def. 10.8], to which we refer (see also the review in
[8, §4]). In [4, Def. 21.6], the required relations are formulated differently; we
compare the definitions in Lemma 10.4 below.
    Definition 3.1. We call a Σ-Laurent functional L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗
an Arthur-Campoli functional if it annihilates E ∗ ( · : x)v for all x ∈ X and
v ∈ Vτ . The set of all Arthur-Campoli functionals is denoted AC(X : τ ), and
the subset of the Arthur-Campoli functionals with support in a∗q is denoted
ACR (X : τ ).
        A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                   885

     It will be shown below in Lemma 3.8 that the elements of AC(X : τ ) are
natural objects, from the point of view of characterizing F(Cc∞ (X : τ )).
     Let H be a real Σ-configuration in a∗qC , and let d ∈ NH . By P(a∗q , H, d) we
denote the linear space of functions ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H, d) with polynomial decay in
the imaginary directions, that is
(3.1)                      sup (1 + |λ|)n |πω,d (λ)ϕ(λ)| < ∞
                        λ∈ω+ia∗q

for all compact ω ⊂ a∗q and all n ∈ N. The space P(a∗q , H, d) is given a Fréchet
topology by means of the seminorms in (3.1). The union of these spaces over
all d : H → N, equipped with the limit topology, is denoted P(a∗q , H).

    Definition 3.2. Let H = H(X, τ ) and d = dX,τ . We define
        PAC (X : τ ) = {ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C | Lϕ = 0, ∀L ∈ ACR (X : τ )},
and equip this subspace of P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C with the inherited topology.

    Lemma 3.3. The space PAC (X : τ ) is a Fréchet space.

    Proof. Indeed, PAC (X : τ ) is a closed subspace of P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C, since
Laurent functionals are continuous on P(a∗q , H, d) (cf. [5, Lemma 1.11]).

     In Definition 3.2 it is required that the elements of PAC (X : τ ) belong
to P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C where H = H(X, τ ) and d = dX,τ are specifically given
in terms of the singularities of the Eisenstein integrals. It will be shown in
Lemma 3.11 below that this requirement is unnecessarily strong (however, it
is convenient for the definition of the topology).

     Definition 3.4. The Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) is defined as the space
of functions ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ) for which there exists a constant M > 0 such that

for all n ∈ N. The subspace of functions that satisfy (3.2) for all n and a fixed
M > 0 is denoted PWM (X : τ ). The space PWM (X : τ ) is given the relative
topology of PAC (X : τ ), or equivalently, of P(a∗q , H, d)⊗ ◦ C where H = H(X, τ )
and d = dX,τ . Finally, the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) is given the limit
topology of the union
(3.3)                    PW(X : τ ) = ∪M >0 PWM (X : τ ).

     The functions in PW(X : τ ) are called Paley-Wiener functions. By the
definition just given they are the functions in M(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C for which the
estimates (3.1) and (3.2) hold, and which are annihilated by all Arthur-Campoli
functionals with real support.

     Remark 3.5. It will be verified later that PWM (X : τ ) is a closed subspace
of PAC (X : τ ) (see Remark 4.2). Hence PWM (X : τ ) is a Fréchet space, and
PW(X : τ ) a strict LF-space (see [20, p. 291]). Notice that the Paley-Wiener
space PW(X : τ ) is not given the relative topology of PAC (X : τ ). However,
the inclusion map PW(X : τ ) → PAC (X : τ ) is continuous.

       We are now able to state the Paley-Wiener theorem for the pair (X, τ ).

     Theorem 3.6. The Fourier transform F is a topological linear isomor-
phism of CM∞ (X : τ ) onto PW (X : τ ), for each M > 0, and it is a topological
                             M
linear isomorphism of Cc∞ (X : τ ) onto the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ).
                                           ∞ (X : τ ) is the subspace of C ∞ (X : τ )
     Here we recall from [6, p. 36], that CM
consisting of those functions that are supported on the compact set K exp BM H,
where BM ⊂ aq is the closed ball of radius M , centered at 0. The space
CM∞ (X : τ ) is equipped with its standard Fréchet topology, which is the rela-

tive topology of C ∞ (X : τ ). Then

(3.4)                     Cc∞ (X : τ ) = ∪M >0 CM
                                                ∞
                                                  (X : τ )

and Cc∞ (X : τ ) carries the limit topology of this union.
     The final statement in the theorem is an obvious consequence of the first,
in view of (3.3) and (3.4). The proof of the first statement will be given in the
course of the next 5 sections (Theorems 4.4, 4.5, proof in Section 8). It relies
on several results from [6], which are elaborated in the following two sections.
At present, we note the following:
                                              ∞ (X : τ ) continuously and
     Lemma 3.7. The Fourier transform F maps CM
injectively into PWM (X : τ ) for each M > 0.

     Proof. The injectivity of F is one of the main results in [4, Thm. 15.1].
It follows from [6, Lemma 4.4], that F maps CM       ∞ (X : τ ) continuously into the

space P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C, where H = H(X, τ ) and d = dX,τ , and that (3.2) holds
for ϕ = Ff ∈ F(CM     ∞ (X : τ )). Finally, it follows from Lemma 3.8 below that

F maps into PAC (X : τ ).

     Lemma 3.8. Let L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ . Then L ∈ AC(X : τ ) if and
only if LFf = 0 for all f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ).

       Proof. Recall that Ff is defined by (2.1) for f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ). We claim
that
                                  Z
(3.5)                     LFf =           LE ∗ ( · : x)f (x) dx,
                                      X

that is, the application of L can be taken inside the integral.
      A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                    887

      The function λ 7→ E ∗ (λ : x) on a∗qC belongs to M(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C for each
x ∈ X, where H = H(X, τ ) and d = dX,τ . The space M(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C is a
complete locally convex space, when equipped with the initial topology with
respect to the family of maps ϕ 7→ πω,d ϕ into O(ω), and x 7→ E ∗ ( · : x) is
continuous (see [3, Lemma 14]). The integrals in (2.1) and (3.5) may be seen
as integrals with values in this space. Since Laurent functionals are continuous,
(3.5) is justified.
      Assume now that L ∈ AC(X : τ ) and let f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ). Then
LE ∗ ( · : x)f (x) = 0 for each x ∈ X, and the vanishing of LFf follows im-
mediately from (3.5).
      Conversely, assume that L annihilates Ff for all f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ). From
(3.5) and [4, Lemma 7.1], it follows easily that L annihilates E ∗ ( · : a)v for
v ∈ VτK∩H∩M and a ∈ A+         q (Q), with Q ∈ Pσ
                                                 min arbitrary. Let v ∈ V . Since
                                                                           τ
E ∗ (λ : kah) = E ∗ (λ : a) ◦ τ (k)−1 for k ∈ K, a ∈ Aq and h ∈ H, it is seen that
E ∗ (λ : kah)v = E ∗ (λ : a)P (τ (k)−1 v) where P denotes the orthogonal projec-
tion Vτ → VτK∩H∩M . Hence L annihilates E ∗ ( · : x)v for all x ∈ X+ , v ∈ V .
By continuity and density the same conclusion holds for all x ∈ X.

      Remark 3.9. In Definition 3.2 we used only Arthur-Campoli functionals
with real support. Let PAC (X : τ )∼ denote the space obtained in that definition
with ACR (X : τ ) replaced by AC(X : τ ), and let PW(X : τ )∼ denote the space
obtained in Definition 3.4 with PAC (X : τ ) replaced by PAC (X : τ )∼ . Then
clearly PAC (X : τ )∼ ⊂ PAC (X : τ ) and PW(X : τ )∼ ⊂ PW(X : τ ). However,
it follows from Lemma 3.8 that F(Cc∞ (X : τ )) ⊂ PW(X : τ )∼ , and hence as a
consequence of Theorem 3.6 we will have
                           PW(X : τ )∼ = PW(X : τ ).

     In general, the Arthur-Campoli functionals are not explicitly described.
Some relations of a more explicit nature can be pointed out: these are the
relations (2.4) that express transformations under the Weyl group. In the
following lemma it is shown that these relations are of Arthur-Campoli type,
which explains why they are not mentioned separately in the definition of the
Paley-Wiener space.

    Lemma 3.10. Let ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ). Then ϕ(sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ) for all
s ∈ W and λ ∈ a∗qC generic.

      Proof. The relation ϕ(sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ) is meromorphic in λ, so it
suffices to verify it for λ ∈ a∗q . Let H = H(X, τ ). Fix s ∈ W and λ ∈ a∗q such
that C ◦ (s : λ) is nonsingular at λ, and such that λ and sλ do not belong to any
of the hyperplanes from H. Let ψ ∈ ◦ C and consider the linear form Lψ : ϕ 7→
hϕ(sλ) − C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ)|ψi on M(a∗q , H) ⊗ ◦ C. It follows from [7, Remark 10.6],
that for each ν ∈ a∗qC there exists a Σ-Laurent functional which, when applied
888                  E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


to the functions that are regular at ν, yields the evaluation in ν. Obviously, the
support of such a functional is {ν}. Hence there exists L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗
with support {λ, sλ} such that Lϕ = Lψ ϕ for all ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H) ⊗ ◦ C. It
follows from (2.3) and Definition 3.1 that L ∈ ACR (X : τ ). The lemma follows
immediately.

     Lemma 3.11. Let H be a real Σ-configuration in a∗qC and let ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H)
⊗ ◦ C. Assume Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ ACR (X : τ ). Then ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ).

      Proof. Let d ∈ NH be such that ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H, d) ⊗ ◦ C. We may assume
that H ⊃ H(X, τ ) and that d  dX,τ (that is, d(H) ≥ dX,τ (H) for all H ∈ H),
where dX,τ is trivially extended to H. Let H ∈ H be arbitrary and let l be the
least nonnegative integer for which λ 7→ (hλ, αH i − sH )l ϕ(λ) is regular along
Hreg := H \ ∪{H ′ ∈ H | H ′ 6= H}. Then l ≤ d(H), and the statement of the
lemma amounts to l ≤ dX,τ (H).
      Assume that l > dX,τ (H); we will show that this leads to a contradiction.
Let d′ ∈ NH be the element such that d′ (H) = l and which equals d on all other
hyperplanes in H. Then ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H, d′ )⊗ ◦ C and d′ ≻ dX,τ . Let λ0 ∈ Hreg ∩ a∗q .
It follows from [7, Lemmas 10.4, 10.5], that there exists L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur such
that Lφ is the evaluation in λ0 of (hλ, αH i − sH )l φ(λ) for all φ ∈ M(a∗q , H, d′ ).
Obviously, supp L = {λ0 } ⊂ a∗q . Since l > dX,τ (H), the functional L ⊗ η
annihilates M(a∗q , H, dX,τ )⊗◦ C for all η ∈ ◦ C ∗ and hence belongs to ACR (X : τ ).
Then it also annihilates ϕ, that is, the function (hλ, αH i − sH )l ϕ(λ) vanishes
at λ0 , which was arbitrary in Hreg ∩ a∗q . By meromorphic continuation this
function vanishes everywhere. This contradicts the definition of l.

                           4. Pseudo wave packets

     In the Fourier inversion formula T Ff = f the pseudo wave packet T Ff
is defined by
                            Z
(4.1)       T Ff (x) = |W |       E+ (λ : x)Ff (λ) dλ,  x ∈ X+ ,
                               η+ia∗q

for f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and for η ∈ a∗q sufficiently antidominant (the function is
then independent of η). Here dλ is the translate of Lebesgue measure on ia∗q ,
normalized as in [6, eq. (5.2)]. A priori , T Ff belongs to the space C ∞ (X+ : τ )
of smooth τ -spherical functions on X+ , but the identity with f shows that it
extends to a smooth function on X.
     The pseudo wave packets are also used for the proof of the Paley-Wiener
theorem: Given a function in the Paley-Wiener space, the candidate for its
Fourier preimage is constructed as a pseudo wave packet on X+ . In this sec-
tion we reduce the proof of the Paley-Wiener theorem to one property of such
         A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                  889

pseudo wave packets. This property, that they extend to global smooth func-
tions on X, will be established in Section 8
     We first recall some spaces defined in [6], and relate them to the spaces
given in Definitions 3.2 and 3.4.

     Definition 4.1. Let P(X : τ ) be the space of meromorphic functions ϕ : a∗qC
→   ◦Chaving the following properties (i)–(iii) (see (2.9) for the definition of π):

  (i) ϕ(sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ) for all s ∈ W and generic λ ∈ a∗qC .

 (ii) There exists ε > 0 such that πϕ is holomorphic on a∗q (P, ε).

(iii) For some ǫ > 0, for every compact set ω ⊂ a∗q (P, ε) ∩ a∗q and for all n ∈ N,
                                  sup (1 + |λ|)n kπ(λ)ϕ(λ)k < ∞.
                             λ∈ω+ia∗q


Moreover, for each M > 0 let PM (X : τ ) be the subspace of P(X : τ ) consisting
of the functions ϕ ∈ P(X : τ ) with the following property (iv).

 (iv) For every strictly antidominant η ∈ a∗q there exists a constant tη ≥ 0 such
      that

(4.2)                sup          (1 + |λ|)dim aq +1 e−M |Re λ| kϕ(λ)k < ∞.
                t≥tη ,λ∈tη+ia∗q

     Notice that (ii) and (iii) are satisfied by any function
                            ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H(X, τ ), dX,τ ) ⊗ ◦ C,
by the definition of π. If ϕ belongs to the subspace PAC (X : τ ) it also satisfies
(i), by Lemma 3.10, and hence
(4.3)                   PW(X : τ ) ⊂ PAC (X : τ ) ⊂ P(X : τ ).
Moreover, the estimate in (3.2) is stronger than (iv), and hence
(4.4)                PWM (X : τ ) ⊂ PAC (X : τ ) ∩ PM (X : τ ).

     Remark 4.2. It will be shown later by Euclidean Fourier analysis, see
Lemma 9.3, that the stronger estimate (3.2) holds for all ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ). In
particular, it follows that in fact
(4.5)                PWM (X : τ ) = PAC (X : τ ) ∩ PM (X : τ ).
It will also follow from Lemma 9.3 that PWM (X : τ ) is a closed subspace
of PAC (X : τ ), hence a Fréchet space. Alternatively, the latter property of
PWM (X : τ ) follows directly from Theorem 3.6, in the proof of which it is
never used. In fact, (4.5) will be established in the course of that proof.
890                  E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


     Remark 4.3. It will also be shown, see Lemma 10.2, that there exist
a real Σ-configuration H∼ and a map d∼ : H∼ → N such that P(X : τ ) ⊂
P(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C. In combination with Lemma 3.11 this implies that
           PAC (X : τ ) = {ϕ ∈ P(X : τ ) | Lϕ = 0, ∀L ∈ ACR (X : τ )}.
The present remark is not used in the proof of Theorem 3.6.

     Recall from [6, §4], that the pseudo wave packet of (4.1) can be formed with
Ff replaced by an arbitrary function ϕ ∈ P(X : τ ). The resulting function
T ϕ ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ) is given by
                              Z
(4.6)          T ϕ(x) = |W |         E+ (λ : x)ϕ(x) dλ,    x ∈ X+ ,
                               η+ia∗q

for η ∈ a∗q sufficiently antidominant, so that the function is independent of η.
The following theorem represents the main step in the proof of the Paley-
Wiener theorem.

     Theorem 4.4. Let ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ). Then T ϕ extends to a smooth
τ -spherical function on X (also denoted by T ϕ). The map T is continu-
ous from PAC (X : τ ) to C ∞ (X : τ ).

     We will prove this result in Section 8 (see below Theorem 8.3). However,
we first use it to derive the following Theorem 4.5, from which Theorem 3.6 is
an immediate consequence.

    Theorem 4.5.Let M > 0. Then T ϕ ∈ CM∞ (X : τ ) for all ϕ ∈ PW (X : τ ),
                                                                   M
and T is a continuous inverse to the Fourier transform F : CM   ∞ (X : τ ) →

PWM (X : τ ).

     Proof. Let PM ′ (X : τ ) denote the set of functions ϕ ∈ P (X : τ ) for which
                                                               M
T ϕ has a smooth extension to X. We have seen in [6, Cor. 4.11], that F
maps CM ∞ (X : τ ) bijectively onto P ′ (X : τ ) with T as its inverse. It follows
                                       M
from Theorem 4.4 that PAC (X : τ ) ∩ PM (X : τ ) is contained in PM      ′ (X : τ ).

Combining this with Lemma 3.7 and (4.4) we obtain the following chain of
inclusions
              ∞
           F(CM (X : τ )) ⊂ PWM (X : τ ) ⊂ PAC (X : τ ) ∩ PM (X : τ )
                              ′               ∞
                           ⊂ PM (X : τ ) = F(CM (X : τ )).
It follows that these inclusions are equalities (in particular, (4.5) is then estab-
lished). Thus F is bijective CM  ∞ (X : τ ) → PW (X : τ ), with inverse T .
                                                   M
      Since T : PAC (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ) is continuous by Theorem 4.4 and since
PWM (X : τ ) and CM  ∞ (X : τ ) carry the restriction topologies of these spaces, we

conclude that the restriction map T : PWM (X : τ ) → CM     ∞ (X : τ ) is continuous.

                     5. Generalized Eisenstein integrals

     In [6, §10], we defined generalized Eisenstein integrals for X. These will
be used extensively in the following. In this section we recall their definition
and derive some properties of them. For further properties (not to be used
here), we refer to [8], [9].
     Let t ∈ WT(Σ) be an even and W -invariant residue weight (see [5, p. 60])
to be fixed throughout the paper. Let f 7→ Tt∆ f , Cc∞ (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ), be
the operator defined by [6, eq. (5.5)], with F = ∆. The fact that it maps into
C ∞ (X : τ ) is a consequence of [6, Cor. 10.11]. Moreover, if the vectorial part
of X vanishes, that is, if a∆q = {0}, then
                                        Z
                          t
(5.1)                   T∆ f (x) = |W |   Kt∆ (x : y)f (y) dy
                                          X
for x ∈ X, cf. [6, eq. (5.10) and proof of Cor. 10.11], where Kt∆ (x : y) is the
residue kernel defined by [6, eq. (5.7)], with F = ∆.
     If the vectorial part of X vanishes, then we follow [6, Remark 10.5], and
define a finite dimensional space by
(5.2)       At (X : τ ) = Span{Kt∆ ( · : y)u | y ∈ X+ , u ∈ Vτ } ⊂ C ∞ (X : τ ).
The space is denoted C∆ in [6], whereas the present notation is in agree-
ment with [8, §9]. By continuity of Kt∆ and finite dimensionality of At (X : τ ),
Kt∆ ( · : y)u belongs to this space for y ∈ X \ X+ as well.

      Lemma 5.1. Assume a∆q = {0}. Then Tt∆ f ∈ At (X : τ ) for all f ∈
Cc∞ (X :τ ), and the map Tt∆ : Cc∞ (X : τ ) → At (X : τ ) is surjective.

    Proof. The map y 7→ Kt∆ ( · : y)f (y) belongs to Cc∞ (X : τ ) ⊗ At (X : τ ).
Hence its integral (5.1) over X belongs to At (X : τ ). The surjectivity follows
from (5.1); see [8, Lemma 9.1].

      Remark 5.2. It is seen in [8, Thm. 21.2, Def. 12.1 and Lemma 12.6], that
At (X : τ ) equals the discrete series subspace L2d (X : τ ) of L2 (X : τ ) and that
Tt∆ : Cc∞ (X : τ ) → At (X : τ ) is the restriction of the orthogonal projection
L2 (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ). In particular, the objects At (X : τ ) and Tt∆ are inde-
pendent of the choice of the residue weight t. In the present paper t is fixed
throughout and we do not need these properties. However, to simplify notation
let T∆ := Tt∆ and A(X : τ ) := At (X : τ ).

      Fix F ⊂ ∆ and let aF q ⊂ aq be defined as in [6, p. 41]. For each v ∈ W
let
                             XF,v = MF /MF ∩ vHv −1
be the reductive symmetric space defined as in [6, p. 51]. We use the notation
of [6, pp. 51, 52], related to this space. Put τF = τ |MF ∩K and let the finite

be the analog for XF,v of the space A(X : τ ) of (5.2); cf. [6, eq. (10.7)], where
the space is denoted CF,v . The assumption made before (5.2), that the vectorial
part of X vanishes, holds for XF,v . For ψ ∈ A(XF,v : τF ) we have defined the
                                   ◦ (ψ : ν) ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ) in [6, Def. 10.7]; it is
generalized Eisenstein integral EF,v
a linear function of ψ and a meromorphic function of ν ∈ a∗F qC . Let us recall
the definition.
     The space A(XF,v : τF ) is spanned by elements ψ ∈ C ∞ (XF,v : τF ) of the
form

                      ψ(m) = ψy,u (m) = KFt (XF,v : m : y)u

that it is well defined is shown in [6, Lemma 10.6], by using the induction of
relations of [7]. Let

     Remark 5.3. A priori the generalized Eisenstein integral EF◦ (ψ : ν : x) de-
pends on the choice of the residue weight t. In fact, already the parameter
space A(XF,v : τF ) for ψ depends on t through the residue weight ∗t. However,
according to Remark 5.2 (applied to the symmetric space XF,v ) the latter
is actually not the case. Once the independence of A(XF,v : τF ) on ∗t has
been established, it follows from the characterization in [8, Thm. 9.3], that
EF◦ (ψ : ν : x) is independent of t. Therefore, this parameter is not indicated in
the notation. The independence of t is not used in the present paper.

u ∈ Vτ . Then

for x ∈ X+ and generic ν ∈ a∗F qC .

     Proof. If y ∈ XF,v,+ then (5.4) holds and (5.7) follows from [6, eq. (8.9]).
The map y 7→ ψy,u , XF,v → A(XF,v : τF ) is continuous, and EF,v  ◦ (ψ : ν : x) is

linear in ψ, hence the left side of (5.7) is continuous in y ∈ XF,v . The other
side is continuous as well, so (5.7) follows by the density of XF,v,+ in XF,v .

     Let

      f 7→ TF (XF,v : f ),    Cc∞ (XF,v : τ ) → A(XF,v : τF ) ⊂ C ∞ (XF,v : τ )

be the analog for XF,v of the operator T∆ of (5.1) (with respect to some choice
of invariant measure dy on XF,v ). The operator TF (XF,v : f ) should not be
confused with the operator TtF of [6, eq. (5.5)], which maps between function
spaces on X. In the following lemma we examine the generalized Eisenstein
          ◦ (T (X
integral EF,v  F    F,v : f ) : ν). Let the Fourier transform associated with XF,v
be denoted f 7→ F(XF,v : f ). It maps Cc∞ (XF,v : τ ) into M(a∗⊥                    ◦
                                                                     F qC , ΣF ) ⊗ CF,v

      Proof. For each y ∈ XF,v let ψy ∈ C ∞ (XF,v : τ ) be defined by ψy (m) =
ψy,f (y) (m) = KFt (XF,v : m : y)f (y); cf. (5.3). Then ψy ∈ A(XF,v : τF ) and
                 ∗


y 7→ ψy isRcontinuous into this space. We conclude from (5.1), applied to XF,v ,
that ψ = XF,v ψy dy pointwise on XF,v , and hence also as a A(XF,v : τF )-valued
integral. The Eisenstein integral EF,v ◦ (ψ : ν : x) is linear in the first variable,

hence we further conclude that

        =
           λ∈Λ(XF,v ,F )                  s∈W F

for x ∈ X+ . We insert this relation into (5.10) and take the residue operator
outside the integral over y ∈ supp f ⊂ XF,v . The justification is similar to that
given in the proof of Lemma 3.8. Using (5.8) we then obtain (5.9).

   Lemma 5.6. The expressions (5.4), (5.7), (5.9) remain valid if the set of
summation Λ(XF,v , F ) is replaced by any finite subset Λ of a∗⊥
                                                              F q containing
Λ(XF,v , F ).

     Proof. It follows from [6, Lemma 10.6], that the sum in (5.4) remains
unchanged if Λ(XF,v , F ) is replaced by Λ. That the same conclusion holds for
(5.7) and (5.9) is then seen as in the proofs of Lemmas 5.4 and 5.5.

                 6. Induction of Arthur-Campoli relations

     In this section we prove in Theorem 6.2 a result that will play a crucial
role for the Paley-Wiener theorem. It shows that Arthur-Campoli functionals
on the smaller symmetric space XF,v induce Arthur-Campoli functionals on
the full space X. The result is established by means of the theory of induction
of relations developed in [7, Cor. 16.4]. The corresponding result in the group
case is [1, Lemma III.2.3], however, for the unnormalized Eisenstein integrals.
Let F ⊂ ∆, and let S ⊂ a∗⊥ F qC be finite.

     Lemma 6.1.Let H be a Σ-configuration in a∗qC , and let L ∈ M(a∗⊥         ∗
                                                                   F qC , ΣF )laur
with supp L ⊂ S.
  (i) The set of affine hyperplanes in a∗F qC ,
       HF (S) = ∪a∈S {H ′ | ∃H ∈ H : a + H ′ = (a + a∗F qC ) ∩ H ( a + a∗F qC },
      is a Σr (F )-configuration, which is real if H is real and S ⊂ a∗⊥
                                                                      F q . The
      corresponding set of regular points is
  reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)) = {ν ∈ a∗F qC | ∀a ∈ S, H ∈ H : a+ν ∈ H ⇒ a+a∗F qC ⊂ H}.

 (ii) For each ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H) and each ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)) there exists a
      neighborhood Ω of S in a∗⊥                             ν
                               F qC such that the function ϕ : λ 7→ ϕ(λ + ν)
      belongs to M(Ω, ΣF ).
(iii) Fix ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)). There exists a Laurent functional (in general
      not unique) L′ ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur , supported by the set ν + S, such that
      L′ ϕ = Lϕν for all ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H).
        A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                    895

 (iv) The function L∗ ϕ : ν 7→ Lϕν belongs to M(a∗F qC , HF (S)) for each ϕ ∈
      M(a∗qC , H).

 (v) The map L∗ maps M(a∗qC , H) continuously into M(a∗F qC , HF (S)) and if
     H is real, P(a∗q , H) continuously into P(a∗F q , HF (S)).

    Proof. See [7, Cor. 11.6 and Lemma 11.7]. The continuity in (v) between
the M spaces is proved in [7, Cor. 11.6(b)]; the continuity between the P
spaces is similar, see also [5, Lemma 1.10].

     Let H = H(X, τ ) and let ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)). Let v ∈ F W and let
prF,v : ◦ C → ◦ CF,v be the projection operator defined by [7, (15.3)].

     Theorem 6.2. For each L ∈ AC(XF,v : τF ) with supp L ⊂ S there exists
a Laurent functional (in general not unique) L′ ∈ AC(X : τ ), supported by the
set ν + S, such that
(6.1)                          L[prF,v ϕ(ν + · )] = L′ ϕ,
for all ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H) ⊗ ◦ C. In particular, if in addition S ⊂ a∗⊥
                                                                 F q then

(6.2)                            L[prF,v ϕ(ν + · )] = 0
for all ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ).

     Proof. The existence of L′ ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ such that (6.1) holds fol-
lows from Lemma 6.1 (iii). We will show that every such element L′ belongs to
AC(X : τ ). If ν ∈ reg(a∗F q , HF (S)) the statement (6.2) is then straightforward
from the definition of PAC (X : τ ), and in general it follows by meromorphic
continuation.
     That L ∈ AC(XF,v : τF ) means by definition that it belongs to
                               M(a∗⊥         ∗     ◦ ∗
                                  F qC , ΣF )laur ⊗ CF,v

and satisfies
(6.3)                          L[E ∗ (XF,v : · : m)u] = 0
for every m ∈ XF,v , u ∈ Vτ . By (6.1) the claim that L′ ∈ AC(X : τ ) amounts
to
(6.4)                       L[prF,v E ∗ (X : ν + · : x)u] = 0
for all x ∈ X. This claim will now be established by means of [7, Cor. 16.4].
     If ψ ∈ M(a∗⊥                                        ∨
                    F qC , ΣF ), then the function ψ : λ 7→ ψ(−λ̄) belongs to
M(a∗⊥                                      ∗⊥        ∗
     F qC , ΣF ) as well. If L ∈ M(aF qC , ΣF )laur , then it is readily seen that
there exists a unique L∨ ∈ M(a∗⊥               ∗
                                    F qC , ΣF )laur such that

for all ψ ∈ M(a∗⊥   F qC , ΣF ); here the superscript ∗ indicates that the complex
conjugate is taken. The maps ψ 7→ ψ ∨ and L → L∨ are antilinear. More
generally, if H is a Hilbert space and v ∈ H, then by v ∗ we denote the element
of the dual Hilbert space H ∗ defined by v ∗ : w 7→ hw, vi. The maps (ψ, v) 7→
Ψ∨ ⊗v ∗ and (L, v) 7→ L∨ ⊗v ∗ induce antilinear maps from M(a∗⊥      F qC , ΣF )⊗H to
M(aF qC , ΣF ) ⊗ H , and from M(aF qC , ΣF )laur ⊗ H to M(aF qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ H ∗ ,
      ∗⊥              ∗                    ∗⊥     ∗               ∗⊥

which we denote by ψ 7→ ψ ∨ and L 7→ L∨ as well. With this notation formula
(6.5) is valid for all ψ ∈ M(a∗⊥                                    ∗⊥         ∗
                                  F qC , ΣF )⊗H ⊗Vτ and all L ∈ M(aF qC , ΣF )laur ⊗H.
It is then an identity between members of Vτ .
      Notice that by definition of E ∗ (XF,v : · : m) it is the ψ ∨ of
               ψ = E ◦ (XF,v : · : m) ∈ M(a∗⊥           ◦ ∗
                                           F qC , ΣF ) ⊗ CF,v ⊗ Vτ .

It now follows from (6.5) and (6.3) that
(6.6)                        L∨ (E ◦ (XF,v : · : m)) = 0
for all m ∈ XF,v , with L∨ ∈ M(a∗⊥         ∗     ◦
                                F qC , ΣF )laur ⊗ CF,v defined as above. Let

                   L2 = (1 ⊗ iF,v )L∨ ∈ M(a∗⊥         ∗     ◦
                                           F qC , ΣF )laur ⊗ C,

then L2 (E ◦ (XF,u : · : m) ◦ prF,u ) = 0 for all u ∈ F W, by (6.6) and [7, (16.2)].
In view of [7, Cor. 16.4] with L1 = 0 this implies that
(6.7)                        L2 [E ◦ (X : ν + · : x)] = 0
for x ∈ X+ , hence by continuity also for x ∈ X. Since L2 = (L(1 ⊗ prF,v ))∨
we readily obtain (6.4) by application of (6.5) to (6.7).

             7. A property of the Arthur-Campoli relations

     The aim of this section is to establish a result, Lemma 7.4, which elabo-
rates on the definition of the space AC(X : τ ) by means of some simple linear
algebra.
     For any finite set S ⊂ a∗qC we denote by OS the space of germs at S of func-
tions φ ∈ O(Ω), holomorphic on some open neighborhood Ω of S. Moreover, if
Ω is an open neighborhood of S and d : Σ → N a map, then by M(Ω, S, Σ, d) we
denote the space of meromorphic functions ψ on Ω, whose germ at a belongs
     −1
to πa,d Oa for each a ∈ S. Here

                           πa,d (λ) = Πα∈Σ hα, λ − aid(α)
for λ ∈ a∗qC (cf. [7, eq. (10.1)]). Finally, we put M(Ω, S, Σ) = ∪d M(Ω, S, Σ, d).

     Lemma 7.1. Let L ⊂ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ be a finite dimensional linear
subspace, and let S denote the finite set supp L := ∪L∈L supp L ⊂ a∗qC . Then
there exists a finite dimensional linear subspace V ⊂ Cc∞ (X : τ ) with the fol-
lowing properties:
     A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                    897

  (i) Let Ω ⊂ a∗qC be an open neighborhood of S and let ψ ∈ M(Ω, S, Σ) ⊗ ◦ C
      be annihilated by L ∩ AC(X : τ ). Then there exists a unique function
      f = fψ ∈ V such that LFf = Lψ for all L ∈ L.
 (ii) The map ψ 7→ fψ has the following form. There exists a Hom(◦ C, V )-
      valued Laurent functional L′ ∈ L ⊗ V ⊂ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ Hom(◦ C, V ) such
      that fψ = L′ ψ for all ψ.
     We first formulate a result in linear algebra, and then deduce the above
result.

     Lemma 7.2. Let A, B and C be linear spaces with dim C < ∞, and let α ∈
Hom(A, B) and β ∈ Hom(B, C) be given. Put C ′ = β(α(A)). Then there exists
a finite dimensional linear subspace V ⊂ A with the property that, for each
ψ ∈ β −1 (C ′ ), there exists a unique element fψ ∈ V such that β(α(fψ )) = β(ψ).
Moreover, there exists an element µ ∈ Hom(C, V ) such that fψ = µ(β(ψ)) for
all ψ.

     Proof. The proof is shorter than the statement. Since β◦α maps A onto C ′
we can choose V ⊂ A such that the restriction of β ◦α to it is bijective V → C ′ .
Then fψ ∈ V is uniquely determined by β ◦ α(fψ ) = β(ψ), and if µ : C → V
is any linear extension of (β ◦ α)−1 : C ′ → V , the relation fψ = µ(β(ψ)) holds
for all ψ.

      Proof of Lemma 7.1. It is easily seen by using a basis for L that S is a
finite set.
      We shall apply Lemma 7.2 with A = Cc∞ (X : τ ), B = M(Ω, S, Σ)⊗ ◦ C and
C = L∗ , the linear dual of L. Furthermore, as α : A → B we use the Fourier
transform F followed by taking restrictions to Ω, and as β : B → C = L∗ we
use the map induced by the pairing (L, ψ) 7→ Lψ, L ∈ L, ψ ∈ B.
      We now determine the image C ′ = β(α(A)). By definition it consists
of all the linear forms on L given by the application of L ∈ L to a func-
tion in F(Cc∞ (X : τ )). Hence the polar subset C ′⊥ ⊂ L is exactly the set
of L ∈ L that annihilate F(Cc∞ (X : τ )). By Lemma 3.8, an element L ∈
L annihilates F(Cc∞ (X : τ )) if and only if it belongs to AC(X : τ ). Hence
C ′⊥ = L ∩ AC(X : τ ). Thus β −1 (C ′ ) consists precisely of those elements
ψ ∈ B = M(Ω, S, Σ) ⊗ ◦ C that are annihilated by L ∩ AC(X : τ ).
      The lemma now follows immediately from Lemma 7.2.
    Lemma 7.3. Let L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur and let φ ∈ OS where S = supp L.
The map Lφ : ψ 7→ L(φψ) is a Laurent functional in M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur , supported
at S.
     Proof. (See also [7, eq. (10.7)].) For each a ∈ S, let ua = (ua,d ) be the
string that represents L at a. Let Ω be an open neighborhood of S. Fix

by the Leibniz rule we can write
                           XX
(7.1)               Lφ ψ =       u1a,i [φ](a) u2a,i [πa,d ψ](a)
                                  a∈S   i

for finitely many u1a,i , u2a,i
                         ∈        S(a∗q ).   Thus Lφ has the form required of a Laurent
functional with support in S.

      Lemma 7.4. Let L0 ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur and let d : Σ → N. There exists a
finite dimensional linear subspace V ⊂ Cc∞ (X : τ ) with the following properties:
  (i) Let Ω ⊂ a∗qC be an open neighborhood of S := supp L0 and let ψ ∈
      M(Ω, S, Σ, d) ⊗ ◦ C. Assume that Lψ = 0 for all L ∈ AC(X : τ ) with
      supp L ⊂ S. Then there exists a unique function f = fψ ∈ V such that
      L0 (φFf ) = L0 (φψ) for all φ ∈ OS ⊗ ◦ C ∗ .
 (ii) The map ψ 7→ fψ has the following form. There exists a Hom(◦ C, V )-
      valued germ φ′ ∈ OS ⊗ Hom(◦ C, V ) such that fψ = L0 (φ′ ψ) for all ψ.

     Proof. We may assume that the given d ∈ NΣ satisfies the requirement that
Ff |Ω belongs to M(Ω, Σ, d)⊗ ◦ C for all f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ), for some neighborhood
Ω of S (otherwise we just replace d by a suitable successor in NΣ ).
     Let O1 = OS ⊗ ◦ C ∗ and let O0 denote the subspace of O1 consisting
of the elements φ ∈ O1 for which the Laurent functional L0φ : ψ 7→ L0 (φψ)
in M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ annihilates M(Ω, S, Σ, d) ⊗ ◦ C (with the fixed element
d), for all neighborhoods Ω of S. It follows immediately from (7.1), applied
componentwise on ◦ C, that an element φ ∈ O1 belongs to O0 if a finite num-
ber of fixed linear forms on O1 annihilate it; hence dim O1 /O0 < ∞. Fix a
complementary subspace O′ of O0 in O1 , and let
                   L = {L0φ | φ ∈ O′ } ⊂ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ .
Choose V ⊂ Cc∞ (X: τ ) according to Lemma 7.1. Then for each ψ ∈ M(Ω, S, Σ, d)
⊗ ◦ C satisfying Lψ = 0 for all L ∈ L ∩ AC(X : τ ), there exists a unique function
fψ ∈ V such that LFfψ = Lψ for all L ∈ L. Thus L0 (φFfψ ) = L0 (φψ) for
all φ ∈ O′ , and this property determines fψ uniquely. On the other hand,
by the definition of O0 we have L0 (φFfψ ) = 0 = L0 (φψ) for φ ∈ O0 . Thus
L0 (φFfψ ) = L0 (φψ) holds for all φ ∈ O1 .
      The statement (ii) follows immediately from the above and the corre-
sponding statement in Lemma 7.1.

                              8. Proof of Theorem 4.4

     The inversion formula for the Fourier transform that was obtained in [6,
Thm. 1.2], reads
                                    X

                           ∗
the measure dµa∗F q on iaF q are as defined in [6, p. 42] (with H equal to the
union of H(X, τ ) with the set of singular hyperplanes for E+ ). It follows from
[6, eq. (4.2)] and [5, Lemma 1.11], that the integral in (8.2) converges, and
that TFt ϕ ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ). Moreover,

in analogy with the second equality in (8.1); see the arguments leading up to
[6, eq. (5.3)].
      The existence of a smooth extension of T ϕ will be proved by showing that
TFt ϕ has the same property, for each F . We shall do this by exhibiting it as a
wave packet of generalized Eisenstein integrals.
      Let H denote the union of H(X, τ ) with the set of all affine hyperplanes
in a∗qC along which λ 7→ E+,s (λ : x) is singular, for some x ∈ X+ , s ∈ W . By
Lemma 2.1 this is a real Σ-configuration and there exists d : H → N such that

     Proof. For each ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)) and a ∈ S the element a + ν is
only contained in a given hyperplane from H if this hyperplane contains all of
a + a∗F qC . Let H(a + a∗F qC ) denote the (finite) set of such hyperplanes, and let
H(S + a∗F qC ) = ∪a∈S H(a + a∗F qC ). Let d : H → N be as mentioned before the
lemma, and let the polynomial function p be given by (2.6) with ω = ν + S,
where ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)). Then
                                    Y
                      p(λ) =               (hαH , λi − sH )d(H) ,
                             H∈H(S+a∗F qC )

and thus p is independent of ν. Moreover, since a + a∗F qC ⊂ H we conclude
that αH ∈ ΣF for all H ∈ H(S + a∗F qC ). Hence p(ν + λ) = p(λ) for ν ∈ a∗F qC
and λ ∈ a∗⊥
         F qC . The maps

                λ 7→ p(λ)E+,s (ν + λ : x),    a∗⊥         ◦
                                               F qC → Hom( C, Vτ ),

are then holomorphic at S for all ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)), s ∈ W and x ∈ X+ .
     Choose d0 ∈ N such that dX,τ (H) ≤ d0 for all H ∈ H(S + a∗F qC ) ∩
H(X, τ ) and define d′ : ΣF → N by d′ (α) = d0 for all α. Then, for each
ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)) and ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H(X, τ ), dX,τ ) ⊗ ◦ C the function
                      ψ ν,ϕ := prF,v ◦ϕν : λ 7→ prF,v ϕ(ν + λ)
on a∗⊥                             ′     ◦
     F qC belongs to M(Ω, ΣF , d ) ⊗ CF,v for some neighborhood Ω of S (cf.
Lemma 6.1). If in addition ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ) then by Theorem 6.2 this function
is annihilated by all elements of AC(XF,v : τ ) supported by S.
     Let L0 be the functional on M(a∗⊥                                       −1

is easily seen that L0 ∈ M(a∗⊥             ∗

Cc (XF,v : τ ) according to Lemma 7.4, applied to XF,v , L0 and d′ . Then there
exists for each ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (S)) and ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ) a unique element
fν,ϕ = fψν,ϕ ∈ V such that
                        L0 (φF(XF,v : fν,ϕ )) = L0 (φψ ν,ϕ )
for all φ ∈ OS ⊗ ◦ CF,v
                    ∗ . We apply this identity with

                               X
                   φ(λ) = p(λ)     υ ∗ ◦ E+,s (ν + λ : x) ◦ iF,v
                                 s∈W F

for arbitrary υ ∗ ∈ Vτ∗ , and deduce (8.4).
     According to Lemma 7.4 (ii) there exists φ′ ∈ OS ⊗ Hom(◦ CF,v , V ) such
that fν,ϕ = L0 (φ′ ψ ν,ϕ ). The map L′v : ψ 7→ L0 (φ′ ψ) is a Hom(◦ CF,v , V )-valued
Laurent functional (see Lemma 7.3) satisfying (8.5). The linearity of ϕ 7→ fν,ϕ
follows from (8.5).

that ν ∈ reg(a∗F qC , HF (Λ)), where H is as defined above Lemma 8.1.

     Proof. In the expression on the left side of (8.6) we can replace the set
Λ(F ) by Λ (see [6, Lemma 7.5]). Moreover, we can replace the residue oper-

Let Lv be as in Lemma 8.2 for each v ∈ F W, and let

     L = |W |t(a+F q)   Lv ◦ prF,v ∈ M(a∗⊥           ∗          ◦

The identity (8.9) then follows immediately from (8.2), (8.6), (5.6). The re-
maining statements follow from Lemma 6.1(v) combined with the estimate in
[6, Lemma 10.8].

    As a corollary we immediately obtain (cf. (8.3)) that T ϕ ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ) for
every ϕ ∈ PAC (X : τ ), and that T : PAC (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ) is continuous.
The proofs of Theorems 4.4, 4.5 and 3.6 are then complete.

                     9. A comparison of two estimates

     The purpose of this section is to compare the estimates (3.2) and (4.2),
and to establish the facts mentioned in Remark 4.2. The method is elementary
Euclidean Fourier analysis.
     Fix R ∈ R and let Q = Q(R) denote the space of functions φ ∈ O(a∗q (P, R))
(see (2.7)) for which
(9.1)                νω,n (φ) :=     sup (1 + |λ|)n |φ(λ)| < ∞
                                   λ∈ω+ia∗q

for all n ∈ N and all bounded sets ω ⊂ a∗q (P, R) ∩ a∗q . The space Q, endowed
with the seminorms νω,n , is a Fréchet space.
     For M > 0 we denote by QM = QM (R) the subspace of Q consisting of
the functions φ ∈ Q that satisfy the following: For every strictly antidominant
η ∈ a∗q there exist constants tη , Cη > 0 such that
(9.2)                 |φ(λ)| ≤ Cη (1 + |λ|)− dim aq −1 eM | Re λ|
for all t ≥ tη and λ ∈ tη + ia∗q (note that tη + ia∗q ⊂ a∗q (P, R) for t sufficiently
large).

    Lemma 9.1. (i) Let λ0 ∈ a∗q (P, R) ∩ a∗q and let ω ⊂ a∗q (P, R) ∩ a∗q be a
compact neighborhood of λ0 . Let M > 0 and N ∈ N. There exist n ∈ N and
C > 0 such that
(9.3)                 |φ(λ)| ≤ C(1 + |λ|)−N eM | Re λ| νω,n (φ)
for all λ ∈ λ0 + ā∗q (P, 0) and φ ∈ QM .
      (ii) QM is closed in Q.
      (iii) Let φ ∈ QM . Then pφ ∈ QM for each polynomial p on a∗qC .

     Proof. (i) From the estimates in (9.1) it follows that µ 7→ φ(λ0 + µ)
is a Schwartz function on the Euclidean space ia∗q ; in fact by a straightfor-
ward application of Cauchy’s integral formula we see that every Schwartz-type
      A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                      903

seminorm of this function can be estimated from above by (a constant times)
νω,n (φ) for some n.
      Let f : aq → C be defined by
                                  Z
(9.4)                     f (x) =      eλ(x) φ(λ) dλ.
                                     λ0 +ia∗q

Then x 7→ e−λ0 (x) f is a Schwartz function on aq , and by continuity of the
Fourier transform for the Schwartz topologies every Schwartz-seminorm of this
function can be estimated by one of the νω,n (φ). Moreover, it follows from the
Fourier inversion formula that
                                  Z
(9.5)                      φ(λ) =    e−λ(x) f (x) dx,
                                      aq

for λ ∈ λ0 +   ia∗q ,
                    where dx is Lebesgue measure on aq (suitably normalized).
     It follows from (9.4) and an application of Cauchy’s theorem, justified by
(9.1), that f (x) is independent of the choice of the element λ0 . Since this
element was arbitrary in a∗q (P, R) ∩ a∗q , we conclude that (9.5) holds for all
λ ∈ a∗q (P, R).
     Let µ ∈ a∗q (P, 0) and let η = Re µ. Then η is strictly antidominant. Let
t ≥ tη . Replacing λ0 by tη in (9.4) and applying (9.2) we obtain the estimate
                                             Z
                 |f (x)| ≤ Cη etη(x) etM |η|   (1 + |λ|)− dim aq −1 dλ.
                                            ia∗q

By taking the limit as t → ∞ we infer that if η(x) + M |η| < 0 then f (x) = 0.
     We use (9.5) to evaluate φ(λ0 + µ). It follows from the previous statement
that we need only to integrate over the set where −η(x) ≤ M |η|. On this
set the integrand e−(λ0 +µ)(x) f (x) is dominated by eM |η| e−λ0 (x) |f (x)|. Thus we
obtain
                                               Z
                                     M | Re µ|
(9.6)              |φ(λ0 + µ)| ≤ e               e−λ0 (x) |f (x)| dx
                                                   aq

for µ ∈  a∗q (P, 0),hence, by continuity, also for µ ∈ ā∗q (P, 0). Using (9.5) and
partial integration, we obtain a similar estimate for µ(x0 )k φ(λ0 + µ) for any
x0 ∈ aq , k ∈ N; on the right-hand side of (9.6) e−λ0 f is then replaced by
its k-th derivative in the direction x0 . This shows that for each N ∈ N,
(1 + |µ|)N |φ(λ0 + µ)| can be estimated in terms of eM | Re µ| and a Schwartz-
seminorm of e−λ0 f . The latter seminorm may then be estimated by νω,n (φ),
for suitable n, and (9.3) follows, but with µ = λ − λ0 in place of λ on the
right-hand side. Since 1 + |λ| ≤ 1 + |λ0 | + |µ| ≤ (1 + |λ0 |)(1 + |µ|) and
| Re µ| ≤ | Re λ0 | + | Re λ|, the stated form of (9.3) follows from that.
     (ii) Let φ be in the closure of QM in Q; then by continuity (i) holds for
φ as well. Let η be a given, strictly antidominant, element of a∗q . Choose
tη > 0 such that λ0 := tη η ∈ a∗q (P, R). Now (9.2) follows from (9.3) with
N = dim aq + 1. Hence φ ∈ QM .
904                  E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


    (iii) As before, let η be given and choose tη > 0 such that λ0 = tη η ∈
a∗q (P, R).
          Then by (i), (9.3) holds, and since N is arbitrary (9.2) follows with
φ replaced by pφ.

    Lemma 9.2. There exist a real Σ-configuration H∼ , a map d∼ : H∼ → N
and a number ε > 0 with the following property. Let ϕ : a∗qC → ◦ C be any
meromorphic function such that

  (i) ϕ(sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ) for all s ∈ W and generic λ ∈ a∗qC ,

 (ii) πϕ is holomorphic on a neighborhood of ā∗q (P, 0).

Then ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C and πϕ is holomorphic on a∗q (P, ε).

    Notice (cf. (2.3)) that (i), (ii) hold with ϕ = E ∗ ( · : x)v, for any x ∈ X,
v ∈ Vτ . It follows that E ∗ ( · : x)v ∈ M(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C. Hence H(X, τ ) ⊂ H∼
and dX,τ  d∼ |H(X,τ ) .
     Proof. Let H(X, τ ) and dX,τ be as in Section 2, and for each s ∈ W let
Hs , ds be such that C ◦ (s : · ) ∈ M(a∗q , Hs , ds ); cf. Lemma 2.1. Let
                     H∼ = ∪s∈W {sH | H ∈ H(X, τ ) ∪ Hs }.
Furthermore, let d∼ ∈ NH be defined as follows. We agree that dX,τ (H) = 0
                            ∼



for H ∈                               / Hs . For H ∈ H∼ let
      / H(X, τ ) and ds (H) = 0 for H ∈
                     d∼ (H) = max dX,τ (s−1 H) + ds (s−1 H).
                                s∈W

     We now assume that ϕ satisfies (i) and (ii). Let λ0 ∈ ā∗q (P, 0) and s ∈ W .
Let π0 denote the polynomial determined by (2.6) with ω = {λ0 } and with
H = H(X, τ ) and d = dX,τ . Since λ0 ∈ ā∗q (P, 0), we see that π0 divides
π and the quotient π/π0 is nonzero at λ0 . Hence π0 ϕ is holomorphic in a
neighborhood of λ0 , by (ii). Likewise, let πs denote the polynomial determined
by (2.6) with ω = {λ0 } and with H = Hs and d = ds , then πs C ◦ (s : · ) is
holomorphic at λ0 . Hence π0 πs C ◦ (s : · )ϕ is holomorphic at λ0 , and by (i)
it follows that λ 7→ π0 (s−1 λ)πs (s−1 λ)ϕ(λ) is holomorphic at sλ0 . Let π ∼
be defined by (2.6) with ω = {sλ0 } and with H = H∼ and d = d∼ . Then
the polynomial λ 7→ π0 (s−1 λ)πs (s−1 λ) divides π ∼ , by the definition of d∼ , and
hence π ∼ ϕ is holomorphic at sλ0 . Since every point in a∗qC can be written in the
form sλ0 with λ0 ∈ ā∗q (P, 0) and s ∈ W , it follows that ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ )⊗ ◦ C.
The statement about the existence of ε is now an easy consequence of (ii) and
the local finiteness of H∼ .

     It follows from Lemma 9.2 that a fixed number ε can be chosen such that
the condition in (ii) of Definition 4.1 holds for all ϕ ∈ P(X : τ ) simultaneously.
In the following lemma, we fix such a number ε > 0.
        A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                 905

     Lemma 9.3. Let M > 0 and let ω ⊂ a∗q (P, ε) be a compact neighborhood
of 0. Let N ∈ N. Then there exist n ∈ N and C > 0 such that
(9.7)            sup (1 + |λ|)N e−M | Re λ| kπ(λ)ϕ(λ)k ≤ Cνω,n (πϕ)
                  q (P,0)
              λ∈ā∗

for all ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ) (see Definition 4.1). Moreover,
(9.8)                 PWM (X : τ ) = PM (X : τ ) ∩ PAC (X : τ ),
and this is a closed subspace of PAC (X : τ ).

      Proof. We first show that πϕ ∈ QM (ε) ⊗ ◦ C for all ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ). Let
ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ) and let R1 ∈ R be sufficiently negative so that ϕ is holomorphic
on a∗q (P, R1 ). Then ϕ ∈ QM (R1 )⊗ ◦ C and hence it follows from Lemma 9.1 (iii)
with R = R1 , applied componentwise to the ◦ C-valued function ϕ, that πϕ ∈
QM (R1 ) ⊗ ◦ C. Since (9.2) does not invoke R, and since πϕ is already known
to satisfy (9.1) with R = ǫ (see Def. 4.1) it follows that πϕ ∈ QM (ε) ⊗ ◦ C as
well. By a second application of Lemma 9.1, this time with R = ǫ and λ0 = 0,
we now obtain (9.7). The identity (9.8) follows from (4.4) and (9.7). The map
ϕ 7→ πϕ is continuous PAC (X : τ ) → Q ⊗ ◦ C and PM (X : τ ) ∩ PAC (X : τ ) is
the preimage of QM ⊗ ◦ C. Hence it is closed.

        10. A different characterization of the Paley-Wiener space

     In [4, Def. 21.6], we defined the Paley-Wiener space PW(X : τ ) somewhat
differently from Definition 3.4, and we conjectured in [4, Rem. 21.8], that this
space was equal to F(Cc∞ (X : τ )). The purpose of this section is to establish
equivalence of the two definitions of PW(X : τ ) and to confirm the conjecture
of [4].
     The essential difference between the definitions is that in [4] several prop-
erties are required only on ā∗q (P, 0); the identity ϕ(sλ) = C ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ) (cf.
Lemma 3.10) is then part of the definition of the Paley-Wiener space. In the
following theorem we establish a property of C ◦ (s : λ) which is crucial for com-
parison of the definitions. Let ΠΣ,R denote the set of polynomials on a∗qC which
are products of functions of the form λ 7→ hα, λi + c with α ∈ Σ and c ∈ R.

     Theorem 10.1. Let s ∈ W and let ω ⊂ a∗q be compact. There exist a poly-
nomial q ∈ ΠΣ,R and a number N ∈ N such that λ 7→ (1 + |λ|)−N q(λ)C ◦ (s : λ)
is bounded on ω + ia∗q .

    Proof. See [10].

      Lemma 10.2. The space P(X : τ ) of Definition 4.1 is equal to the space
of ◦ C-valued meromorphic functions on a∗qC that have the properties (i)–(ii) of
Lemma 9.2 together with:
906                    E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


      (iii) For every compact set ω ⊂ ā∗q (P, 0) ∩ a∗q and for all n ∈ N,
                            sup (1 + |λ|)n kπ(λ)ϕ(λ)k < ∞.
                          λ∈ω+ia∗q

Moreover, there exist a real Σ-configuration H∼ and a map d∼ : H∼ → N such
that
(10.1)                      P(X : τ ) ⊂ P(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C.

      Proof. Condition (i) in Definition 4.1 is the same as (i) in Lemma 9.2,
whereas (ii) is stronger. However, it was seen in Lemma 9.2 that (i)∧(ii) implies
(ii) of Definition 4.1. The condition (iii) in Definition 4.1 is also stronger than
(iii) above.
      It thus remains to be seen that (i)–(iii) above imply (iii) of Definition
4.1, and that (10.1) holds. We will establish both at the same time. Let H∼
and d∼ be as in Lemma 9.2, and assume that ϕ satisfies (i)–(iii) above; then
ϕ ∈ M(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C. Let ω ⊂ a∗q be compact. Using Theorem 10.1 we see
from (iii) together with (i) that there exists a polynomial Q ∈ ΠΣ,R such that
                            sup (1 + |λ|)n kQ(λ)ϕ(λ)k < ∞
                          λ∈ω+ia∗q

for each n ∈ N. Clearly we may assume that Q is divisible by πω,d∼ (λ) (see
(2.6)). Using [2, Lemma 6.1] and the fact that ω was arbitrary, we can in fact
remove all factors of Q/πω,d∼ (λ) from the estimate, so that we may assume Q =
πω,d∼ (λ). Hence ϕ ∈ P(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C. The statement in (iii) of Definition
4.1 follows by the same reasoning, when we invoke the already established
statement (ii) of that definition.

     Lemma 10.3. The pre-Paley-Wiener space M(X : τ ) defined in [4, Def.
21.2], is identical with ∪M >0 PM (X : τ ), where PM (X : τ ) is as defined in Def-
inition 4.1.

     Proof. Let M > 0 and ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ). Then properties (a) and (b) of
[4, Def. 21.2], are obviously fulfilled, and (c), with R = M , follows from (9.7).
Hence ϕ ∈ M(X : τ ).
     Conversely, let ϕ ∈ M(X : τ ), then ϕ ∈ P(X : τ ) by Lemma 10.2. More-
over, condition (iv) in Definition 4.1 results easily from (c) of [4], with M = R.
Hence ϕ ∈ PM (X : τ ).

     In [4] the space PW(X : τ ) is defined as the space of functions ϕ ∈
M(X : τ ) that satisfy certain relations. These relations will now be interpreted
in terms of Laurent functionals by means of the following lemma.

       Lemma 10.4. Let u1 , . . . , uk ∈ S(a∗q ), ψ1 , . . . , ψk ∈ ◦ C, and λ1 , . . . , λk ∈
ā∗q (P, 0). Then there exists a Laurent functional L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ , such
       A PALEY-WIENER THEOREM FOR REDUCTIVE SYMMETRIC SPACES                    907

that
                                k
                                X
(10.2)                   Lϕ =         ui [π(λ)hϕ(λ)|ψi i]λ=λi
                                i=1

for all ϕ ∈ M(X : τ ). Conversely, given L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ there exist k,
ui , ψi and λi as above such that (10.2) holds for all ϕ ∈ M(X : τ ).

     Proof. To prove the existence of L we may assume that k = 1. Let
d = dX,τ and let π1 = π{λ1 },d be determined by (2.6). Then π1 divides π;
let p denote their quotient. It follows from [7, Lemma 10.5], that there exists
L1 ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ such that

                         L1 ϕ = u1 [π1 (λ)hϕ(λ)|ψ1 i]λ=λ1

for all ϕ such that π1 ϕ is holomorphic near λ1 . By Lemma 7.3 the map
L : ϕ 7→ L1 (pϕ) belongs to M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ . It clearly satisfies (10.2).
     Conversely, let L ∈ M(a∗qC , Σ)∗laur ⊗ ◦ C ∗ be given. We may assume that
the support of L consists of a single point in a∗qC . This point equals sλ0 for
suitable λ0 ∈ ā∗q (P, 0) and s ∈ W . Let π0 , πs and π ∼ be as in the proof of
Lemma 9.2. The restriction of L to M(a∗q , H∼ , d∼ ) ⊗ ◦ C is a finite sum of terms
of the form

(10.3)                    ϕ 7→ u[π ∼ (λ)hϕ(λ)|ψi]λ=sλ0 ,

where ψ ∈ ◦ C and u ∈ S(a∗q ). For ϕ ∈ M(X : τ ) we use the Weyl conjugation
property and rewrite (10.3) in the form

                      ϕ 7→ u[π ∼ (sλ)hC ◦ (s : λ)ϕ(λ)|ψi]λ=λ0 ,

in which the element u has been replaced by its s-conjugate. Since the poly-
nomial π0 πs divides π ∼ (sλ), and since πs (λ)C ◦ (s : λ) is holomorphic at λ0 it
follows from the Leibniz rule that this expression can be further rewritten as
a finite sum of terms of the form

(10.4)                      ϕ 7→ u[π0 (λ)hϕ(λ)|ψi]λ=λ0

where ψ ∈ ◦ C and u ∈ S(a∗q ). Finally, since π0 divides π, the following
lemma shows that there exists u′ ∈ S(a∗q ) such that (10.4) takes the form
ϕ 7→ u′ [π(λ)hϕ(λ)|ψi]λ=λ0 , which is as desired in (10.2).

     Let ΠR denote the set of polynomials on a∗qC which are products of func-
tions of the form λ 7→ hξ, λi + c with ξ ∈ a∗q \ {0} and c ∈ R.

    Lemma 10.5. Let p ∈ ΠR . There exists for each u ∈ S(a∗q ), an element
u′ ∈ S(a∗q ) such that u′ (pϕ)(0) = uϕ(0) for all germs ϕ at 0 of holomorphic
functions on a∗qC .
908                     E. P. VAN DEN BAN AND H. SCHLICHTKRULL


     Proof. We may assume that the degree of p is one. Then p(λ) = hξ, λi +
p(0) for some nonzero ξ ∈ a∗q . The case that p(0) = 0 is covered by [5, Lemma
1.7 (i)]. Thus, we may assume that p(0) = 1. Let ξ ′ = ξ/hξ, ξi. Then ξ ′ p = 1,
when ξ ′ is considered as a constant coefficient differential operator acting on
the function p. By linearity we may assume that u is of the form u = u′′ ξ ′k with
k ∈ N and u′′ ∈ S(ξ ′⊥ ). Let u′ = u′′ ki=0 (−1)k−i k!    ′i
                                       P
                                                      i! ξ . A simple calculation
                                    ′
with the Leibniz rule shows that u (pϕ)(0) = uϕ(0), as desired.

    Corollary 10.6. The Paley-Wiener spaces PW(X : τ ) in Definition 3.4
and in [4, Def. 21.6], are identical, and both are equal to F(Cc∞ (X : τ ))).

    Proof. In view of (9.7), it is immediate from Lemmas 10.3 and 10.4 that
the space PW(X : τ ) of [4] is identical to the space denoted PW(X : τ )∼ in
Remark 3.9. According to that remark, it follows from Theorem 3.6 that this
space is equal to PW(X : τ ) as well as to F(Cc∞ (X : τ )).
