                                                     Abstract. In this article we initiate a systematic study of irreducible weight
                                                     modules over direct limits of reductive Lie algebras, and in particular over
                                                     the simple Lie algebras A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) and D(∞). Our main tool is
                                                     the shadow method introduced recently in [DMP]. The integrable irreducible
                                                     modules are an important particular class and we give an explicit parametriza-

                                                The purpose of this paper is to initiate a systematic study of the irreducible
                                             weight representations of direct limits of reductive Lie algebras, and in particular
                                             of the classical simple direct limit Lie algebras A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) and D(∞).
                                             We study arbitrary, not necessarily highest weight, irreducible weight modules and
                                             describe the supports of all such modules. The representation theory of the classical
                                             direct limit groups has been initiated in the pioneering works of G. Olshanskii [O1]
                                             and [O2] and is now in an active phase, see the recent works of A. Habib, [Ha], L.
                                             Natarajan, [Na], K.-H. Neeb, [Ne], and L. Natarajan, E. Rodriguez-Carrington and
                                             J. A. Wolf, [NRW]. Nevertheless, the structure theory of weight representations of
                                             the simple direct limit Lie algebras has until recently been still in its infancy as
                                             only highest weight modules have been discussed in the literature, see the works of
                                             Yu. A. Bahturin and G. Benkart, [BB], K.-H. Neeb, [Ne], and T. D. Palev, [P].
                                                Our approach is based mainly on the recent paper [DMP] in which a general
                                             method for studying the support of weight representations of finite-dimensional Lie
                                             algebras (and Lie superalgebras) was developed. We prove first that the shadow of
                                             any irreducible weight module M (over any root reductive direct limit Lie algebra,
                                             in particular over A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) and D(∞)) is well-defined, which means
                                             that for a given root α the intersection of the ray λ + R+ α with the support of
                                             M , suppM , is either finite for all λ ∈ suppM or infinite for all λ ∈ suppM . Using
                                             this remarkable property of the support, we assign to M a canonical parabolic
                                             subalgebra pM of g and then compare M with the irreducible quotient of a certain
                                             g-module induced from pM . In the case of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, the
                                             Fernando-Futorny parabolic induction theorem, see [Fe], [Fu] and [DMP], states
                                             that M is always such a quotient and moreover that suppM is nothing but the
                                             support of the induced module. In the direct limit case we show that this is no
                                             longer true but nevertheless, using the fact that the shadow is well-defined, we
                                             obtain an explicit description of the support of any irreducible weight module.

   We discuss in more detail the following special cases: when suppM is finite
in all root directions (these are the finite integrable irreducible modules and they
are analogues of finite-dimensional irreducible modules over finite-dimensional Lie
algebras) and the more general case when suppM is finite in at least one of each two
mutually opposite root directions. An interesting feature in the first case is that M
is not necessarily a highest weight module, i.e. the analogues of finite-dimensional
irreducible modules are already outside the class of highest weight modules. We
present an explicit parametrization of all finite integrable irreducible modules. The
modules corresponding to the second case are by definition pseudo highest weight
modules and one of their interesting features is that in general they are not obtained
by parabolic induction as in the Fernando-Futorny theorem.

  1. Generalities on triangular decompositions and weight modules
    The ground field is C. The signs ⊂+ and ⊃ + denote semi-direct sum of Lie algebras

(if g = g ⊂ g , then g is an ideal in g as well as a g′′ -module). The superscript
           ′ + ′′        ′
∗
   always stands for dual space. We set R+ := {r ∈ R | r ≥ 0}, R− := −R+ ,
Z± := Z ∩ R± , δ ij is Kronecker’s delta, and linear span with coefficients in C
(respectively, R, Z, R± ) is denoted by < >C (resp. by < >R , < >Z , < >R± ).
If g is any Lie algebra and M is a g-module, we call M integrable iff g acts locally
finitely on M ; this terminology is introduced by V. Kac, in [BB] integrable modules
are called locally finite. If g is a direct sum of Lie algebras, g = ⊕s∈S gs , and for
each s M s is an irreducible gs -module with a fixed non-zero vector ms ∈ M , then
(⊗s M s )(⊗s ms ) denotes the g-submodule of ⊗s M s generated by ⊗s ms . It is easy
to check that (⊗s M s )(⊗s ms ) is an irreducible g-module.
    Let g be a Lie algebra. A Cartan subalgebra of g is by definition a self-normalizing
nilpotent Lie subalgebra h ⊂ g. We do not assume g or h to be finite-dimensional.
A g-module M is a generalized weight g-module iff as an h-module M decomposes
as the direct sum ⊕λ∈h∗ M λ , where
           M λ := {v ∈ M | h − λ(h) acts nilpotently on v for every h ∈ h}.
We call M λ the generalized weight space of M of weight λ. Obviously, a generalized
weight g-module is integrable as an h-module. The support of M , suppM , consists
of all weights λ with M λ 6= 0. A generalized weight module M is a weight module
iff h acts semi-simply on M , i.e. iff each generalized weight space is isomorphic to
the direct sum of one-dimensional h-modules.

  Henceforth g will denote a Lie superalgebra with a fixed proper Cartan subalge-
bra h such that g is a generalized weight module, i.e.
                                    g = h ⊕ (⊕α∈h∗ \{0} gα ).                                   (1)
The generalized weight spaces gα are by definition the root spaces of g, ∆ := {α ∈
h∗ \{0}|gα 6= 0} is the set of roots of g, and the decomposition (1) is the root
decomposition of g.
   Below we recall the definitions of a triangular decomposition of ∆ and of a Borel
subalgebra for an arbitrary Lie algebra g with a root decomposition. For more
details see [DP2]. A decomposition of ∆
                                         ∆ = ∆+ ⊔ ∆−                                            (2)
is a triangular decomposition of ∆ iff the cone < ∆+ ∪−∆− >R+ 1 (or equivalently,
its opposite cone < −∆+ ∪ ∆− >R+ ) contains no (real) vector subspace. Equiva-
lently, (2) is a triangular decomposition if the following is a well-defined R-linear
partial order on < ∆ >R :
                       Xn
    η ≥µ⇔η =µ+             ci αi for some αi ∈ ∆+ ∪ −∆− and ci ∈ R+ , or µ = η.
                          i=1
(A partial order is R-linear if it is compatible with addition and multiplication by
positive real numbers, and if multiplication by negative real numbers changes order
direction. In what follows, unless explicitly stated that it is partial, an order will
always be assumed linear, i.e. such that α 6= β implies α < β or α > β. In particu-
lar, an R-linear order is by definition an order which is in addition R-linear.) Any
regular real hyperplane H in < ∆ >R (i.e. a codimension one linear subspace H
with H ∩ ∆ = ∅) determines exactly two triangular decompositions of ∆: we first
assign (in an arbitrary way) the sign + to one of the two connected components of
< ∆ >R \H, and the sign − to the other. ∆± are then by definition the subsets of
∆ which belong respectively to the ”positive” and the ”negative” connected com-
ponents of < ∆ >R \H. In general, not every triangular decomposition of ∆ arises
in this way, see [DP1]. Nevertheless, it is true that every triangular decomposi-
tion is determined by a (not unique) oriented maximal chain of vector suspaces in
< ∆ >R : see the Appendix where we establish the precise interrelationship between
oriented maximal chains in < ∆ >R , R-linear orders on < ∆ >R and triangular
decompositions of ∆.
   A Lie subalgebra b of g is by definition a Borel subalgebra of g iff b = h⊃
                                                                             + ( ⊕ gα )
                                                                                         α∈∆+
for some triangular decomposition ∆ = ∆+ ⊔ ∆− . In what follows a Borel subalge-
bra of g always means a Borel subalgebra containing the fixed Cartan subalgebra
h. Adopting terminology from affine Kac-Moody algebras, we will call a Borel
subalgebra standard iff it corresponds to a triangular decomposition which can be
determined by a regular hyperplane H in < ∆ >R .
   If b is a Borel subalgebra and λ ∈ h∗ , the Verma module Ṽb (λ) with b-highest
weight λ is by definition the induced module U (g) ⊗U(b) Cλ , Cλ being the one-
dimensional b-module on which h acts via λ. Any quotient of Ṽb (λ) is by definition
a b-highest weight module. Furthermore, Ṽb (λ) has a unique maximal proper g-
submodule Ib (λ), and Vb (λ) := Ṽb (λ)/Ib (λ) is by definition the irreducible b-highest
weight g-module with highest weight λ.
  1 We   use the term cone as a synonym for an R+ -invariant additive subset of a real vector space.

                 2. Direct limits of reductive Lie algebras
   A homomorphism ϕ : g → g′ of Lie algebras with root decomposition is a
root homomorphism iff ϕ(h) ⊂ h′ (h and h′ being the corresponding fixed Cartan
subalgebras) and ϕ maps any root space of g into a root space of g′ . Let
                             ϕ1      ϕ2      ϕn−1       ϕn
                         g1 −→ g2 −→ . . . −−−→ gn −−→ . . .                         (3)
be a chain of homomorphisms of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and let g := lim    −→ gn
be the direct limit Lie algebra. We say that g is a root direct limit of the system (3)
iff ϕn is a root homomorphism for every n. In the latter case hn denotes the fixed
Cartan subalgebra of gn . We define a Lie algebra g to be a root direct limit Lie
algebra iff g is a root direct limit of some direct system of the form (3). Furthermore,
a non-zero Lie algebra g is a root reductive direct limit of the system (3) iff all gn
are reductive, and g is a root simple direct limit Lie algebra iff g is a root direct
limit of a system (3) in which all gn are simple.
Proposition 1. Let g be a root direct limit Lie algebra. Then h := −  lim
                                                                       → hn is a
Cartan subalgebra of g and g has a root decomposition with respect to h such that
∆ = −lim
      → ∆n , where ∆n and ∆ are respectively the roots of gn and g. If all root
homomorphisms ϕn are embeddings, one has simply h = ∪n hn and ∆ = ∪n ∆n .
   Proof. A trivial exercise.
   Every simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra g is a root simple direct limit Lie
algebra: we set gn := g and ϕn := idg . To define the simple Lie algebras A(∞),
B(∞), C(∞) and D(∞) it suffices to let gn be the corresponding rank n simple
Lie algebra and to request that all ϕn be injective root homomorphisms, i.e. root
embeddings. Indeed, one can check that in these cases the direct limit Lie algebra
does not depend up to isomorphism on the choice of root embeddings ϕn . More
generally, Theorem 4.4 in [BB] implies that every infinite-dimensional root simple
direct limit Lie algebra is isomorphic to one of the Lie algebras A(∞), B(∞), C(∞)
or D(∞). Note however, that for general root reductive direct limit Lie algebras
the direct limit Lie algebra can depend on the choice of root homomorphisms ϕn
even if they are embeddings. Indeed, set for instance gn := A(2n ) ⊕ B(2n ) and
let ϕn , ϕ′n : gn → gn+1 be root embeddings such that ϕn (A(2n )) ⊂ A(2n+1 ) and
ϕn (B(2n )) ⊂ B(2n+1 ) but ϕ′n (A(2n ) ⊕ B(2n )) ⊂ B(2n+1 ). Then g ≃ A(∞) ⊕ B(∞)
but g′ ≃ B(∞).
   Let g be a root reductive direct limit Lie algebra and let k be a Lie subalgebra
of g such that h ⊂ k. Then ∆k ⊂ ∆g and we can set ∆ss         k := ∆k ∩ (−∆k ). The Lie
subalgebra kss := [⊕α∈∆ss k
                             kα
                                , ⊕α∈∆
                                           α
                                       ss k ] of k is an analogue of the semi-simple part
                                       k
of k in the case when k is not finite-dimensional.
Theorem 1. Let g be a root reductive direct limit Lie algebra. Then
   (i) g ≃ gss ⊂
               + A, A being an abelian Lie algebra of finite or countable dimension.

Furthermore, h = hss ⊕ A, where hss := h ∩ gss .
   (ii) gss ≃ ⊕s∈S gs , S being a finite or countable family of root simple direct limit
Lie algebras gs .
   Proof. (i) Decompose h as h = hss ⊕ A for some vector space A. Then A is an
abelian subalgebra of h (since h itself is abelian) of at most countable dimension,
and using Proposition 1 one checks that g ≃ gss ⊂ + A.

   (ii) Let g = lim
                −→  g n . Proposition 1 implies immediately that gss = − lim  ss
                                                                          → gn . Fur-
thermore, since a Cartan subalgebra hn ⊂ gn is fixed for every n, there is a canonical
                 WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                         5


decomposition as
                                  gn = (⊕t∈Sn gt ) ⊕ Zn
such that all gt are simple, Zn is abelian, and, for every α ∈ ∆n gα               t
                                                                           n ⊂ g for
                                                        t                    ′
some t ∈ Sn . Then, for any t ∈ Sn , either ϕn (g ) = 0 or there is t ∈ Sn+1
                                                    ′
so that ϕn (gt ) is a non-trivial subalgebra of gt (we assume that the sets Sn are
pairwise disjoint). Put S ′ = ∪n {t ∈ Sn | ϕn,n1 (gt ) 6= 0 for every n1 > n}, where
ϕn1 ,n2 := ϕn2 ◦ . . . ◦ ϕn1 for n1 > n2 . Introduce an equivalence relation ∼ on S ′
by setting t1 ∼ t2 for t1 ∈ Sn1 , t2 ∈ Sn2 , iff there exists n such that ϕn1 ,n (gt1 )
and ϕn2 ,n (gt2 ) belong to the same simple component of gn . Define S as the set of
classes of ∼-equivalence. For every s ∈ S the set {gt }t∈s is partially ordered by the
maps ϕn1 ,n2 : gt1 → gt2 . Let gs be the direct limit Lie algebra of a maximal chain
of Lie algebras among {gt }t∈s with respect to this partial order. Obviously gs is
a root simple direct limit Lie algebra and it does not depend on the choice of the
maximal chain. Finally, one checks easily that gss = −       ss
                                                          → gn ≃ ⊕s∈S g .
                                                         lim             s

   Example 1. gl(∞) can be defined as the Lie algebra of all infinite matrices
(aij )i,j∈Z+ with finitely many non-zero entries. Then gl(∞) ≃ A(∞)⊂           + C, but

gl(∞) 6≃ A(∞) ⊕ C as the center of gl(∞) is trivial.
   Theorem 1 gives an almost explicit description of all root reductive direct limit
Lie algebras. In particular, it implies that any root space of a root reductive direct
limit Lie algebra has dimension one. Moreover, if π : h∗ → (hss )∗ denotes the
natural projection, then Theorem 1 implies that π induces a bijection between ∆
and the set of roots of gss . The exact relationship between irreducible generalized
weight g-modules and irreducible generalized weight gss -modules (all of which turn
out to be automatically weight modules) is established in the following proposition.
Proposition 2. (i) Every irreducible generalized weight g-module M is a weight
module.
   (ii) Every irreducible weight g-module M is irreducible as a (weight) gss -module.
   (iii) Given any irreducible weight gss -module M ss , every λ ∈ h∗ with π(λ) ∈
suppM ss defines a unique structure of an irreducible weight g-module on M ss which
extends the gss -module structure on M ss .P
                                           If M ss (λ) denotes the resulting g-module,
          ss        ss ′             ′                                            ′
P M (λ) ≃ M (λ ) iff π(λ − λ ) = i ci π(αi ) with αi ∈ ∆ implies λ − λ =
then
  i ci αi .
   Proof. (i) Let U 0 denote the subalgebra of the enveloping algebra U (g) generated
by monomials of weight zero. Since h acts semisimply on g, the symmetric algebra
S(h) belongs to the center of U 0 . Furthermore, any generalized weight space M λ
is an irreducible U 0 -module and, by a general version of Schur’s Lemma, S(h) acts
via a scalar on M λ . Therefore M is a semi-simple h-module, i.e. M is a weight
module.
   (ii) Follows immediately from (i) and Theorem 1, (i).
         Let any a ∈ A act on the weight
   (iii) P                           P      space M µ of M ss via multiplication by
λ(a) + i αi (a), where µ − π(λ) = i ci π(αi ). It is straightforward to verify that
this equips M ss with a well-defined g-module structure. The isomorphism criterion
is also an easy exercise.
   Our main objective in this paper is the study of the irreducible weight mod-
ules over root reductive direct limit Lie algebras. The case of finite-dimensional
reductive Lie algebras is discussed in particular in [Fe], [Fu], [DMP], [M].
   In the rest of this section we study the structure of the root simple direct limit
Lie algebras and g stands for A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) or D(∞). If εi are the usual

linear functions on the Cartan subalgebras of the simple finite-dimensional Lie
algebras, see for example [B] or [Hu], one can let i run from 1 to ∞ and then (using
Proposition 1) verify the following list of roots:
    A(∞) : ∆ = {εi − εj | i 6= j},
    B(∞) : ∆ = {±εi , ±εi ± εj | i 6= j},
    C(∞) : ∆ = {±2εi , ±εi ± εj | i 6= j},
    D(∞) : ∆ = {±εi ± εj | i 6= j}.
Every sequence of complex numbers {λn }n=1,2,... determines a weight λ of g by
setting λ(εn ) := λn . For g = B(∞), C(∞) or D(∞), every weight λ of g recovers the
sequence {λn := λ(εn )}n=1,2,... ; for g = A(∞), the weight λ recovers the sequence
{λn := λ(εn )}n=1,2,... up to an additive constant only. Furthermore, (·, ·) denotes
the bilinear form (·, ·) : h∗ × h∗ → C which extends the usual bilinear forms (·, ·)n :
h∗n × h∗n → C. If λ ∈ h∗ and α ∈ ∆, we set hλ, αi := 2(λ,α)
                                                          (α,α) . By definition, λ ∈ h
                                                                                      ∗

is an integral weight of g iff hλ, αi ∈ Z for every α ∈ ∆, and λ is b-dominant, for a
Borel subalgebra b = h ⊕ (⊕α∈∆+ gα ), iff hλ, αi ≥ 0 for all α ∈ ∆+ .
    It is proved in [DP2] (Proposition 2) that all Borel subalgebras of A(∞), B(∞),
C(∞) an D(∞) are standard. More precisely, for every Borel subalgebra b of g
there is a linear function ϕ :< ∆ >R → R such that b = h ⊕ (⊕ϕ(α)>0 gα ). Define an
order (or a partial order) on the set {0} ∪ {±εi } to be Z2 -linear iff multiplication
by −1 reverses the order. Then Proposition 2 from [DP2] is essentially equivalent
to the following statement.
Proposition 3. If g = A(∞), there is a bijection between Borel subalgebras of g
and orders on the set {εi }.
   If g = B(∞) or C(∞), there is a bijection between Borel subalgebras of g and
Z2 -linear orders on the set {0} ∪ {±εi }.
   If g = D(∞), there is a bijection between Borel subalgebras of g and Z2 -linear
orders on the set {0} ∪ {±εi } with the property that if there is a minimal positive
element with respect to this order, this element is of the form εi .
   Proof. The pull-back via ϕ of the standard order on R determines an order on
{0} ∪ ∆ which induces an order respectively on {εi } or {0} ∪ {±εi } as desired. Con-
versely, for every order {εi }, or respectively for every Z2 -linear order on {0} ∪{±εi}
as in the Proposition, there exists a (non-unique) linear function ϕ :< {εi } >R → R
such that ∆+ = ϕ−1 (R+ ) ∩ ∆.
   The result of Proposition 3 can be found in an equivalent form in [Ne]. The case
of A(∞) is due to V. Kac (unpublished).
   Example 2. A(∞) is naturally identified with the Lie algebra of traceless
infinite matrices (ai,j )i,j∈Z+ with finitely many non-zero entries, as well as with
the Lie algebra of traceless double infinite matrices (ai,j )i,j∈Z with finitely many
non-zero entries. The respective algebras of upper triangular matrices are non-
isomorphic Borel subalgebras of A(∞) corresponding respectively to the orders
ε1 > ε2 > ε3 > . . . and . . . > ε6 > ε4 > ε2 > ε1 > ε3 > ε5 > . . . .
   A parabolic subalgebra of a root reductive direct limit Lie algebra is by definition a
Lie subalgebra containing a Borel subalgebra. (The general definition of a parabolic
subalgebra of a Lie algebra with root decomposition is given in the Appendix.) Here
is an explicit description of all parabolic subalgebras of A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) and
D(∞).

Proposition 4. If g = A(∞), there is a bijection between parabolic subalgebras of
g and partial orders on the set {εi }.
   If g = B(∞) or C(∞), there is a bijection between parabolic subalgebras of g and
Z2 -linear partial orders on the set {0} ∪ {±εi }.
   If g = D(∞), there is a bijection between parabolic subalgebras of g and Z2 -linear
partial orders on the set {0} ∪ {±εi } with the property that if εi is not comparable
with 0 for some i (i.e. neither εi > 0 nor εi < 0) then εj is also not comparable
with 0 for some j 6= i.
  Proof. Given a partial order on {εi } (respectively, a Z2 -linear partial order on
{0} ∪ {±εi } with the additional property for g = D(∞)), it determines a unique
partial order > on the set {0} ∪ ∆. Put p> := h ⊕ (⊕α>0 or α not comparable with 0 gα ).
Then p> is the parabolic subalgebra corresponding to the initial partial order.
Conversely, let p be a parabolic subalgebra. For α ∈ ∆, set α >p 0 iff gα ⊂ p but
g−α 6⊂ p. Using the explicit form of ∆ it is easy to verify that this determines a
unique partial order on {εi } (respectively on {0} ∪ {±εi } as desired).
  The next proposition describes pss for any parabolic subalgebra p of g = A(∞),
B(∞), C(∞) or D(∞), and will be used in Section 3.
Proposition 5. If p ⊂ g is a parabolic subalgebra of g, then
   (i) pss is isomorphic to a direct sum of simple Lie algebras each of which is one
of the following:
- A(n) or A(∞), if g = A(∞);
- A(n), A(∞), B(n) or B(∞) with at most one simple component isomorphic to
B(n) or B(∞), if g = B(∞);
- A(n), A(∞), C(n) or C(∞) with at most one simple component isomorphic to
C(n) or C(∞), if g = C(∞);
- A(n), A(∞), D(n) or D(∞) with at most one simple component isomorphic to
D(n) or D(∞), if g = D(∞).
   (ii) If pss 6≃ 0, then pss + h ≃ (⊕t∈T kt ) ⊕ Z , where Z is abelian and kt is
isomorphic to gl(n) or gl(∞) for any t ∈ T except at most one index t0 ∈ T for
which kt0 is a root simple direct limit Lie algebra.
   Proof. (i) Let, as in Proposition 4, >p be the partial order corresponding to p.
Partition the set {εi } (respectively {0} ∪ {±εi }) into subsets in such a way that
two elements are comparable with respect to >p iff they belong to different subsets.
Denote by S ′ the resulting set of subsets of {εi } (respectively of {0} ∪ {±εi }). Let
furthermore S be a subset of S ′ which contains exactly one element of any pair s, s′
of mutually opposite elements of S ′ , and for every s ∈ S define gs to be the Lie
algebra generated by gα where α 6= 0 belongs to s or is a sum of any two elements of
s. It is straightforward to verify that pss ≃ ⊕s∈S,gs 6=0 gs is the decomposition of pss
into a direct sum of root simple direct limit Lie algebras and that this decomposition
satisfies (i).
   (ii) The main point is to notice that if s 6= −s, then gs ≃ A(n) for some n or
 s
g ≃ A(∞) and furthermore, that there is at most one s ∈ S such that s = −s.
To complete the proof it remains to show that each of the Lie subalgebras gs for
s 6= −s can be extended to a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to gl(n) or gl(∞). This
latter argument is purely combinatorial and we leave it to the reader.

               3. The shadow of an irreducible weight module
   Let g be a Lie algebra with a root decomposition, M be an irreducible generalized
weight g-module and λ be a fixed point in suppM . For any α ∈ ∆, consider the
set mλα := {q ∈ R|λ + qα ∈ suppM } ⊂ R. There are four possible types of sets mλα :
bounded in both directions; unbounded in both directions; bounded from above
but unbounded from below; unbounded from above but bounded from below. It is
proved in [DMP] that, if g is finite-dimensional, the type of mλα depends only on α
and not on λ, and therefore the module M itself determines a partition of ∆ into
four mutually disjoint subsets:

               ∆F                 λ
                  M := {α ∈ ∆ | mα is bounded in both directions},
                I               λ
              ∆M := {α ∈ ∆ | mα is unbounded in both directions},
       +
     ∆M := {α ∈ ∆ | mλα is bounded from above and unbounded from below},
     ∆−                λ
       M := {α ∈ ∆ | mα is bounded from below and unbounded from above}.
The corresponding decomposition
                                               +    −
                             g = (gF    I
                                   M + gM ) ⊕ gM ⊕ gM ,                              (4)
where gF
       M := h ⊕ (⊕α∈∆F
                     M
                       gα ), gIM := h ⊕ (⊕α∈∆IM gα ) and g±           α
                                                          M := ⊕α∈∆± g , is the
                                                                            M
M -decomposition of g. The triple (gIM , g+        −
                                              M , gM ) is the shadow of M onto g. If g is
infinite-dimensional we say that the shadow of M onto g is well-defined if it is true
that the type of mλα depends only on α and not on λ and thus the decomposition
(4) (as well as the triple (gIM , g+    −
                                   M , gM )) is well-defined.
   In the case when g is finite-dimensional and reductive, it is furthermore true
                             +
that pM := (gF       I
               M + gM ) ⊕ gM is a parabolic subalgebra of g whose reductive part is
gF      I
 M + gM , and that there is a natural surjection
                                                   +
                            ϕM : U (g) ⊗U(pM ) M gM → M,
           +
where M gM is the irreducible (gF        I
                                   M + gM )-submodule of M which consists of all
                               +
vectors in M annihilated by gM . Moreover, suppM simply coincides with
                       +
supp(U (g) ⊗U(pM ) M gM ). This is the Fernando-Futorny parabolic induction theo-
rem, see [Fe] and also [DMP], and in particular it provides an explicit description
of suppM .
   The main purpose of this paper is to understand analogues of these results for a
root reductive direct limit Lie algebra g. Very roughly, the situation turns out to
be as follows: the shadow of an arbitrary irreducible g-module M exists and defines
a parabolic subalgebra pM of g, however the parabolic induction theorem does not
hold. Nevertheless the existence of the shadow and the direct limit structure on g
enable us to obtain an explicit description of suppM for any M .
   Throughout the rest of this paper (except the Appendix) g := lim  −→ gn will be
a root reductive direct limit Lie algebra and M will be a fixed irreducible weight
module over g.
Theorem 2. The shadow of M is well-defined.
   Proof. Note first that, for any given λ ∈ suppM , there exist irreducible (gn + h)-
modules Mn such that λ ∈ suppMn for every n and suppM = ∪n suppMn . Indeed,
fix m ∈ M λ , m 6= 0, and define Mn as any irreducible quotient of the (gn + h)-
module U (gn + h) · m. One checks immediately that suppM = ∪n suppMn .

    Fix α ∈ ∆. To prove the Theorem we need to show that if mλα is bounded from
above for some λ ∈ suppM (the proof for the case when mλα is bounded from below
is exactly the same) then mµα is bounded from above for any other µ ∈ suppM .
First, let λ′ = λ+kα be the end point of the α-string through λ in suppM . Then fix
µ ∈ suppM and pick N so that µ ∈ suppMN , λ′ ∈ suppMN and α ∈ ∆N . Consider
now the α-string through µ. It is the union of the α-strings through µ in suppMn
for n = N, N + 1, . . . . The parabolic induction theorem implies that suppMn (and,
in particular, the α-string through µ in suppMn ) is contained entirely in an affine
half-space in λ+ < ∆n >R whose boundary (affine) hyperplane Hn contains λ′
and is spanned by vectors in ∆n . Furthermore, Hn′ := Hn ∩ (λ+ < ∆N >R ) is
a hyperplane in λ+ < ∆N >R which contains λ′ and is spanned by vectors in
∆N . Since the α-string through µ belongs to λ+ < ∆N >R , the α-string through
µ in suppMn is bounded by Hn′ . But there are only finitely many hyperplanes
in λ+ < ∆N >R passing through λ′ and spanned by vectors in ∆N and hence
among the hyperplanes Hn′ for n = N, N + 1, . . . only finitely many are different.
Therefore, the α-strings through µ in suppMn are uniformly bounded from above,
i.e. mµα is bounded from above.
    The next theorem describes the structure of the M -decomposition and is an
exact analogue of the corresponding theorem for finite-dimensional reductive Lie
algebras.

     Proof. (i) Let α, β ∈ ∆ such that α + β ∈ ∆. Lemma 2 in [PS] implies that
if mλα and mλβ are bounded from above, so is mλα+β . Furthermore, noting that
suppM = ∪n suppMn for some irreducible (gn + h)-modules Mn (see the proof of
Theorem 2) and that the support of every irreducible weight (gn + h)-module is
convex, we conclude that suppM is convex. Therefore if mλα and mλβ are unbounded
from above, so is mλα+β . These two facts imply immediately that all four subspaces
              +          −

  M , gM , gM and gM are subalgebras of g. The fact that h is a Cartan subalgebra

for both gM and gM is obvious.

                      M and β ∈ ∆M , then α + β 6∈ ∆. Indeed, if α + β ∈ ∆ and
                                                                              ′

mα′ +β ′ is bounded from above, then mβ ′ would be bounded from above because
β ′ = −α′ + (α′ + β ′ ). If, on the other hand, α′ + β ′ ∈ ∆ and mλα′ +β ′ is unbounded
from above, then mλα′ would be unbounded from above because α′ = −β ′ +(α′ +β ′ ).
Since both of these conclusions contradict the choice of α′ and β ′ we obtain that
α′ + β ′ 6∈ ∆ and thus that [(gF        ss  I ss
                                   M ) , (gM ) ] = 0.

from above. Assuming that mλα′ +β ′ is bounded from below, we obtain that mλβ′ is
bounded from below as well since −β ′ = −(α′ + β ′ ) + α′ , which contradicts the fact
that β ′ ∈ ∆+                  λ                                   ′      ′     +
                  M . Hence mα′ +β ′ is unbounded from below and α + β ∈ ∆M . This
proves that g+             F                                             ±       F
                   M is a gM -module. One shows in a similar way that gM are gM - and

gM -modules.

   We define an irreducible weight g-module M to be cuspidal iff g = gIM .
   In the rest of this section we prove that for every parabolic subalgebra p of g
there is an irreducible g-module M so that p = pM . Indeed, there is the following
more general
Theorem 4. Let g be a root reductive direct limit Lie algebra. For any given
splitting ∆ = ∆F ⊔ ∆I ⊔ ∆+ ⊔ ∆− with ∆F = −∆F , ∆I = −∆I , ∆− = −∆+ , and
such that its corresponding decomposition
                              g = (gF + gI ) ⊕ g+ ⊕ g−                            (5)
satisfies the properties (i) - (iii) of Theorem 3, there exists an irreducible weight
module M for which (5) is the M -decomposition of g.
   Proof. We start with the observation that it suffices to prove the Theorem for a
root simple direct limit Lie algebra. Indeed, let as in Theorem 1 g ≃ (⊕s∈S gs )⊂
                                                                                + A

and assume that for each s M s is an irreducible weight gs -module corresponding
as in the Theorem to the restriction of the decomposition (5) to gs . Fix non-zero
vectors ms ∈ M s . Then the reader will verify straightforwardly that, for any pair
(M ss := (⊗s M s )(⊗s ms ), λ) as in Proposition 2, (iii), the g-module M := M ss (λ)
is as required by the Theorem. Therefore in the rest of the proof we will assume
that g is a root simple direct limit Lie algebra. We will prove first that cuspidal
modules exist.
Lemma 1. Let g be a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra. For any given weight
µ ∈ h∗ , there exists a cuspidal g-module M I such that the center Z of U (g) acts
on M via the central character χµ : Z → C (obtained by extending µ to a homo-
morphism µ̃ : S · (h) → C and composing with Harish-Chandra’s homomorphism
Z → S · (h)).
   Proof of Lemma 1. It goes by induction on the rank of g. It is a classical fact
that sl(2) admits a cuspidal module of any given central character, so it remains
to make the induction step. Let g′ be a reductive subalgebra of g which contains
h and such that rk g′ = rk g − 1. Let M ′ be a cuspidal g′ -module with central
character χ′µ′ , where µ′ ∈ h∗ and w′ (µ′ ) − µ 6∈< ∆ >Z for any w′ in the Weyl group
W ′ of g′ . Denote by U ′ the subalgebra of U (g) generated by U (g′ ) and Z. Since
U (g) is a free Z-module (Kostant’s Theorem) and U (g′ ) ∩ Z = C, U ′ is isomorphic
to U (g′ ) ⊗C Z. Therefore the tensor product Mχ′ µ := M ′ ⊗ Cχµ , Cχµ being the 1-
dimensional Z-module corresponding to χµ , is a well-defined U ′ -module. Consider
now any irreducible quotient M of the induced g-module U (g) ⊗U ′ Mχ′ µ . Obviously
M is a weight module and we claim that M is cuspidal. Assuming the contrary, M
would be a quotient of U (g) ⊗U(p) M ′′ where p ⊃ g′ and M ′′ is a cuspidal g′ -module
of central character χ′µ . Then, since U (g) is an integrable U (g′ )-module and M ′
would be a subquotient of U (g) ⊗U(p) M ′′ , we would have w′ (µ′ ) − µ ∈< ∆ >Z for
some w′ ∈ W ′ , which is contradiction. Therefore M is cuspidal.

                    −→ gn being an infinite-dimensional root simple direct limit Lie
algebra, we can assume that rk gn+1 −rk gn = 1. We then construct M I as the direct
limit lim
      −→ Mn , each Mn being a cuspidal gn -module build by induction precisely as
in the Proof of Lemma 1. This proves the Theorem in the cuspidal case.
   Let now g 6= gI . According to Theorem 1, gF ≃ ⊕s∈S gs ⊂          + A
                                                                         F
                                                                            and gI ≃

and gI . Since the Theorem is proved for the cuspidal case, we can choose a cuspidal
irreducible gt module M t for each t ∈ T and fix a non-zero vector mt ∈ M t . Then
dI := (⊗t∈T M t )(⊗t mt ) is a cuspidal (gI )ss -module. Let M ′ denote M
M                                                                       dI considered
        F    I ss                                    F ss
as a (g + g ) -module with trivial action of (g ) .
   If dimg < ∞, we can assume furthermore, by Lemma 1, that the (gI )ss -module
d
M I is chosen in such a way that the central character of M     dI corresponds to an
          I       I                               I ss
orbit W · η (W being the Weyl group of (g ) ) which contains no weight of the
form η + κ for an integral weight κ of (gI )ss . Then it is not difficult to verify (we
leave this to the reader) that this condition ensures that if M F I denotes M dI with
              F     I      +
its obvious (g + g ) ⊕ g -module structure and if M is the irreducible quotient of
U (g) ⊗U((gF +gI )⊕g+ ) M F I , the M -decomposition of g is nothing but (5). Theorem
4 is therefore proved for a finite-dimensional reductive g.
   A direct generalization of this argument does not go through for an infinite-
dimensional g. Instead, there is the following lemma which allows us to avoid
referring to central characters.
Lemma 2. If g is infinite-dimensional, the (gF + gI )ss -module structure on M ′
can be extended to a (gF + gI )-module structure in such a way that hµ′ , αi ∈
                                                                             / Z for
some (and hence any) µ′ ∈ suppM ′ and any α ∈ ∆+ ⊔ ∆− .
                                                                   ss
   Proof of Lemma 2. Theorem 4, (iv) implies that gF     I
                                                    M + gM = (pM ) + h. We will
present the proof in the case when gM + gM 6= h. The case when gM + gIM 6= h is
                                     F     I                       F

dealt with in a similar way.
   Using Proposition 5, (ii) we conclude that gF    I
                                               M + gM 6= h implies
                                                 0

                           M + gM ≃ (⊕r∈R g ) ⊕ g ⊕ Z,                             (6)

where each g is isomorphic to gl(n) for some n or to gl(∞), R is a finite or countable
set which does not contain 0 (and may be empty), g0 is a root simple direct limit
Lie algebra, and Z is abelian.
   Let ∆s be the root system of gs for s ∈ R∪{0}. Set s Z := {k ∈ (Z+ \{0})| there is
l ∈ (Z+ \{0}) with εk − εl ∈ ∆s } and # Z := (Z+ \{0})\(∪s∈R∪{0} s Z). As explained
in section 1, any sequence {λn }n=1,2,... ⊂ C determines a weight λ of (gF + gI )ss ,
however λ reconstructs only the subsequence {λn }n∈∪r∈R∪{0} r Z up to an additive
constant for every index from R. Fix now µ ∈ suppM ′ and let {µn }n=1,2,... be a
sequence which determines µ. To prove the Lemma, it suffices to find constants
ci ∈ C for i ∈ Z with the following properties:
- ck = cl whenever k and l belong to one and the same set s Z;
- ck = 0 for k ∈ 0 Z;
           / Z for every k ∈ (Z+ \{0}) for which εk ∈ ∆+ ⊔ ∆− ; 2(µk + ck ) ∈
- µk + c k ∈                                                                   / Z for
every k ∈ (Z+ \{0}) for which 2εk ∈ ∆+ ⊔ ∆− ; and ±(µk + ck ) ± (µl + cl ) ∈   / Z for
every k, l ∈ (Z+ \{0}) for which ±εk ± εl ∈ ∆+ ⊔ ∆− .
Then µ′ will be the weight of (gF + gI ) determined by the sequence {µn + cn }n=1,∞ .
   Consider the set of sequences {ck }k∈P ⊂(Z+ \{0}) with the three properties as
                                                             k′              k′′
above. Introduce an order < on this set by putting {c′ }k′ ∈P ′ < {c′′ }k′′ ∈P ′′
                     k     k
iff P ′ ⊂ P ′′ and c′ = c′′ for every k ∈ P ′ . The reader will check that every
chain (with respect to <) of sequences is bounded and that for every {ck }k∈P with
P 6= (Z+ \{0}) there is a sequence greater than {ck }k∈P . Therefore any maxi-
mal element, which exists by Zorn’s lemma, is a sequence {ck } with the required
properties. Lemma 2 is proved.

   Assuming that g is infinite-dimensional, let now M F I be M ′ considered as a
(g + gI ) ⊕ g+ -module with trivial action of g+ . Then we define M as the (unique)
  F

irreducible quotient of the g-module U (g) ⊗U((gF +gI )⊕g+ ) M F I . Using Lemma 2,
the reader will verify that the M -decomposition of g is precisely the decomposition
(5). The proof of Theorem 3 is therefore complete.

                             4. Integrable modules
Proposition 6. Let M be integrable. Then
   (i) g = gF       I                     F               λ
              M + gM ; furthermore, g 6= gM implies dimM = ∞ for any λ ∈ suppM .
   (ii) If g is infinite-dimensional and simple, M is either cuspidal or g = gF
                                                                              M , and
both cases are possible.
    Proof. (i) As a consequence of the integrability of M , suppM is W -invariant.
Thus ∆±                      F      I
          M = ∅ and g = gM + gM . Furthermore, for any α ∈ ∆ the subalgebra
  Rα                      α        −α
g of g generated by g and g is isomorphic to sl(2) and the integrability of M
implies that as a gRα - module M is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite-dimensional
modules. The assumption that dimM λ < ∞ for some λ ∈ suppM would lead us
to the conclusion that λ belongs to the support of only finitely many of the finite-
dimensional gRα -modules, which would mean that suppM is finite in the direction
of both α and −α. Therefore g 6= gF                     λ
                                       M implies dimM = ∞ for any λ ∈ suppM .
                                                                                 ss
                  F               I
    (ii) If both gM 6= h and gM 6= h, Theorems 1 and 3 imply that (gF         M)    and
   I ss                                                             F          I
(gM ) are proper ideals in g, which is a contradiction. Thus gM = h or gM = h,
i.e. g = gIM or g = gFM.
    Clearly, g = gFM  if M = g is the adjoint representation, so the case g = gF    M is
obviously possible. To prove that integrable cuspidal modules exist, it is enough
to construct a tower of irreducible finite-dimensional gn -modules Mn , . . . → Mn →
Mn+1 → . . . , such that the support of Mn is shorter than the support of Mn+1 in
all root directions of gn . Obviously, M := lim −→ Mn is then an integrable cuspidal
g-module. Here is an explicit example for g = A(∞). Let λn = nε1 − nε2 and let bn
be the Borel subalgebra of gn corresponding to the order ε2 < ε3 < . . . < εn < ε1 .
Set Mn := Vbn (λn ) for n ≥ 2. It is obvious that the support of Mn+1 is longer that
the support of Mn in the direction of every root of gn . The reader will also verify
that Mn appears in the decomposition of Mn+1 as a direct sum of gn -modules and
hence an embedding Mn → Mn+1 exists. The proof of Proposition 6 is therefore
complete.
    Obviously, if M is integrable and is a highest weight module with respect to some
Borel subalgebra b, then g = gF    M . The existence of cuspidal integrable modules is
a significant difference with the case of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, where any
integrable irreducible module is finite-dimensional and is thus a highest weight
module with respect to every Borel subalgebra. In contrast, for g = A(∞), B(∞),
C(∞) and D(∞), the trivial g-module is the only irreducible g-module which is
a highest weight module for all Borel subalgebras. Moreover, as we will see in
Example 3 below, the equality g = gF    M does not guarantee the existence of a Borel
subalgebra with respect to which M is a highest weight module. We define M to
be finite integrable iff g = gFM . The rest of this section is devoted to the study of
finite integrable irreducible g-modules M over an arbitrary root reductive direct
limit Lie algebra g.
    The simplest type of finite integrable modules are highest weight integrable mod-
ules and they are studied in the recent papers [BB], [NRW] and [Ne]. In [BB] the
                 WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                         13


highest weights of integrable highest weight modules are computed explicitly. In
[NRW] the integrable modules Vb (λ) appear in the context of Borel-Weil-Bott’s
theorem and are realized as the unique non-zero cohomology groups of line bundles
on G/B. In [Ne] irreducible highest weight modules with respect to general Borel
subalgebras are considered and in particular it is proved that their integrability is
equivalent to unitarizability. In Theorem 5 below we discuss highest weight mod-
ules and in particular establish a direct limit version of H. Weyl’s character formula
for integrable highest weight modules.
   First we need to recall the notion of basis of a Borel subalgebra of g. A subset
Σ ⊂ ∆+ is a basis of b = h⊕(⊕α∈∆+ gα ) iff Σ is a linearly independent set and every
element of ∆+ is a linear combination of elements of Σ with non-negative integer
coefficients; the elements of Σ are then the simple roots of b. Not every Borel
subalgebra admits a basis. For root simple direct limit Lie algebras a basis of b is the
same as a weak basis in the terminology of [DP2], and in [DP2] all Borel subalgebras
admitting a weak basis are described. The result of [DP2] implies that b admits a
basis iff the corresponding order on {εi }, or respectively on {0} ∪ {±εi }, has the
following property: for every pair of elements of {εi } (respectively of {0} ∪ {±εi })
there are only finitely many elements between them. This latter criterion has been
established also by K.-H. Neeb in [Ne].
Theorem 5. Let M = Vb (λ).
   (i) M is integrable iff λ is an integral b-dominant weight. Furthermore, if M is
integrable, then suppM = C λ , where C λ is the intersection of the convex hull of
W · λ with λ+ < ∆ >R .
   (ii) M ≃ Vb′ (λ′ ) for given b′ and λ′ iff there exists w ∈ W for which λ′ = w(λ)
and there is a parabolic subalgebra p of g containing both w(b) and b′ such that the
                                      ′
p-submodule of M generated by M λ is one-dimensional.
   (iii) dimM µ < ∞ for all µ ∈ suppM iff M ≃ Vb̃ (λ) for some Borel subalgebra b̃
of g which admits a basis.                                   P
   (iv) If M is integrable, b admits a basis, and chM := µ∈suppM dimM µ · eµ is
the formal character of M , we have
                                       X
                          D · chM =        (sgnw)ew(λ+ρb )−ρb ,                  (7)
                                      w∈W
                          −α
where D = Πα∈∆+ (1 − e         ) and ρb ∈ h∗ is a weight for which ρb (α) = 1 for all
simple roots of b.
   Proof. (i) An exercise. In [BB] a more general criterion for the integrability of
Vb (λ) is established for simple direct limit Lie algebras which are not necessarily
root simple direct limit Lie algebras.
   (ii) Define pλ ⊃ b as the maximal parabolic subalgebra of g such that the pλ -
submodule of M generated by M λ is one-dimensional. Then M ≃ Vb′′ (λ) iff b′′ is a
subalgebra of pλ . Finally, it is an exercise to check that M ≃ Vb′ (λ′ ) iff λ′ = w(λ)
and b′ is a subalgebra of pλ′ = w(pλ ) for some w ∈ W .
   (iii) If b̃ admits a basis, then, using the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, one
verifies that all weight spaces of the Verma module Ṽb (λ) are finite-dimensional
(for any λ ∈ h∗ ), and hence all weight spaces of Vb (λ) are finite-dimensional as
well.
   Conversely, let M = Vb (λ) be a highest weight module with finite-dimensional
weight spaces. We need to prove the existence of b̃ which admits a basis and such
                 WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                         14


that M ≃ Vb̃ (λ). Let pλ be as above and let g ≃ (⊕s∈S gs )⊂      + A as in Theorem 1.

Clearly, there is a Borel subalgebra b̃ ⊂ pλ which admits a basis iff for every s ∈ S
there is a Borel subalgebra b˜s of gs admitting basis such that b˜s ⊂ psλ := pλ ∩ gs .
Furthermore, M s := Vbs (λ|hs ) (where bs := b ∩gs and hs := h∩gs ) is an irreducible
gs -submodule of M . Thus it suffices to prove (iii) for the root simple direct limit
Lie algebras gs and their highest weight modules M s . For a finite-dimensional gs
(iii) is trivial, so we need to consider only the case when gs = A(∞), B(∞), C(∞),
D(∞).
    Let >psλ be the partial order corresponding to psλ and let α ∈ (∆s )+ (∆s being
the root system of gs ) be a difference of two elements δ1 and δ2 of {εi } (respectively
of {0} ∪ {±εi }). Then it is not difficult to check that, if there are infinitely many
elements of {εi } (respectively of {0} ∪ {±εi }) between δ1 and δ2 with respect to
>psλ , the weight space of M s with weight λ − α is infinite-dimensional. Therefore,
the assumption that all Borel subalgebras b̃s , such that M s ≃ Vb̃s admit no basis
is contradictory, i.e. a Borel subalgebra b̃s exists as required.
    (iv) To prove formula (7) it suffices to notice that if b admits a basis, g can be
represented as g = −    → gn , where each of the simple roots of bn = b ∩ gn is a simple
                       lim
root of bn+1 = b ∩ gn+1 . Then M = −     → Vbn (λ|hn ) and in both sides of (7) terms of
                                        lim
the form c · eλ+µ for µ ∈< ∆n >R appear only as they appear in the respective sides
of (7) for the gn -module Vb∩gn (λ|hn ). Therefore, Weyl’s original formula implies
the infinite version (7).
    We now turn our attention to general finite integrable modules M . Here is an
example of a finite integrable M which is not a highest weight module with respect
to any Borel subalgebra of g.
    Example 3. Let g = A(∞) and b ⊂ g be the Borel subalgebra of g correspond-
ing to the order ε1 > ε2 > ε3 > . . . . Set λn := ε1 + · · · + εn − nεn+1 . Since
λn ∈ suppVbn+1 (λn+1 ) and the weight space Vbn+1 (λn+1 )λn is one-dimensional,
there is a unique (up to a multiplicative constant) embedding of weight gn -modules
                                                                F
Vbn (λn ) → Vbn+1 (λn+1 ). Set M := lim−→ Vbn (λn ). Then g = gM and all weight spaces
of M are one-dimensional but M is not a highest weight module with respect to
any Borel subalgebra of g.
    The following two theorems provide an explicit parametrization of all finite in-
tegrable modules as well as an explicit description of their supports. Let Wn ⊂ W
denote the Weyl group of gn .
Theorem 6. Let M be finite integrable.
   (i) M ≃ lim −→ Mn for some direct system of finite-dimensional irreducible gn -
modules Mn .
   (ii) suppM determines M up to isomorphism.
   (iii) Fix a Borel subalgebra b of g. Then M ≃ lim −→ Vbn (λn |hn ) for some sequence
{λn } of integral weights of g such that λn |hn is a bn -dominant weight of gn and λn
belongs to an edge of the convex hull of Wn+1 · λn+1 .
   Proof. (i) Fix λ ∈ suppM . We claim that there is a unique irreducible finite-
dimensional gn -module Mnλ such that suppMnλ = (λ+ < ∆n >Z ) ∩ suppM . Indeed,
the equality g = gF M implies that (λ+ < ∆n >Z ) ∩ suppM is a finite set and
hence there is n′ such that (λ+ < ∆n >Z ) ∩ suppM is contained in the support
of an irreducible finite-dimensional gn′ -module Mn′ ′ constructed as in the proof
of Theorem 2. Moreover, the construction of Mn′ ′ implies that (λ+ < ∆n >Z
                  WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                            15


) ∩ suppMn′ ′ = (λ+ < ∆n >Z ) ∩ suppM . But, as the reader will check, there is a
unique irreducible finite-dimensional gn -module Mnλ with suppMnλ = (λ+ < ∆n >Z
) ∩ suppMn′ ′ . Finally Mnλ is a gn -submodule of M according to its construction,
                               λ
and furthermore M = lim −→ Mn .
   (ii) The crucial point is that (according to its construction) Mnλ depends only on
suppM and λ ∈ suppM . Furthermore, for any λ′ ∈ suppM , there is m such that
                                      ′
λ′ ∈ suppMm   λ
                and hence Mnλ ≃ Mnλ for n > m. Letting now n go to ∞, and noting
that for any pair λ, λ′ ∈ suppM there is a compatible system of isomorphisms
            ′
                                                                         λ′
Mnλ ≃ Mnλ for all n > m, we conclude that M = lim              λ
                                                         −→ Mn ≃ lim
                                                                   −→ Mn , i.e. that
suppM determines M up to isomorphism.
   (iii) Since the module Mnλ defined in (i) is finite-dimensional, Mnλ ≃ Vbn (λ   fn )
           f       ∗
for some λn ∈ hn . There is a unique weight µ of g such that µ ∈< ∆n >R and
µ|hn = λ|hn − λ   fn . Set λn := λ − µ ∈ h∗ . Then M ≃ lim M λ ≃ Vb (λ         fn ) =
                                                                −→ n        n


−→ Vbn (λn |hn ) and λn belongs to an edge of the convex hull of Wn+1 · λn+1 because
lim
suppMnλ = (λ+ < ∆n >Z ) ∩ suppM .
Theorem 7. Fix a Borel subalgebra b of g. Let {λn } ⊂ h∗ be a sequence of integral
weights of g such that λn |bn is a bn -dominant weight of gn and λn belongs to an
edge of the convex hull of Wn+1 · λn+1 . Then
   (i) M is finite integrable.
   (ii) suppM = ∪n C λn .
   (iii) M is a highest weight module with respect to some Borel subalgebra of g iff
there is n0 so that λn ∈ W · λn0 for any n ≥ n0 .
   (iv) If M ′ ≃ lim       ′         ′
                 −→ Vbn (λn |hn ), {λn } being a sequence of integral weights of g, such
that λn |hn is a bn -dominant weight of gn and λ′n belongs to an edge of the convex
        ′

hull of Wn+1 · λ′n+1 M ≃ M ′ iff there is n0 so that λn = λ′n for n ≥ n0 .
   Proof. The proof is not difficult and is left to the reader.
   Example 4. Let g = A(∞) and M = g be the adjoint module. If b is the Borel
subalgebra corresponding to the order ε1 > ε2 > . . . , then M ≃ lim      −→ Vbn (ε1 − εn ).
Since W ·(ε1 −εn ) = ∆, Theorem 7, (iii) implies that there exists a Borel subalgebra
b such that the adjoint module is a b-highest weight module. Furthermore, it is
not difficult to verify that all such Borel subalgebras b are precisely the Borel
subalgebras which correspond to orders on {εi } for which there exists a pair of
indices i0 , j0 so that εi0 > εi and εi > εj0 for all i 6= i0 , i 6= j0 .

                       5. Pseudo highest weight modules
   In the case of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, an irreducible weight module M
with gIM = h is necessarily a highest weight module for some Borel subalgebra, see
[DMP]. As we already know (Example 3) this is no longer true for the direct limit
algebras we consider. We define a pseudo highest weight module as an irreducible
weight module M such that gIM = h. Pseudo highest weight modules provide
counterexamples also to the obvious extension of the parabolic induction theorem
to root reductive direct limit Lie algebras. (The module M from Example 3 above
does not provide such a counterexample since in this case pM = g and M =
U (g) ⊗U(pM ) M .) Indeed, it suffices to construct M with gF       I
                                                             M = gM = h such that
                                                            +
M is not a highest weight module with respect to h ⊕ gM and therefore admits
no surjection of the form U (g) ⊗U(pM ) M ′ → M for an irreducible pM -module M ′ .
Here is such an example.
                 WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                            16


   Example 5. Let g = A(∞), B(∞), C(∞) or D(∞). Fix a Borel subalgebra b ⊂
g and let λ ∈ h∗ be such that hλ, αi 6∈ Z for all α ∈ ∆. Construct {λn } inductively
by setting λ3 := λ, λn+1 := λn + α, where αn is a simple root of bn+1 which is not a
root of bn . There are obvious embeddings Vbn (λn |hn ) → Vbn+1 (λn+1 |hn+1 ) so we can
                                           +     −                   +
set M := −  → Vbn (λn |hn ). Then g = h ⊕ gM ⊕ gM where h ⊕ gM = b. Therefore the
           lim
only Borel subalgebra with respect to which M could be a highest weight module is
b. But a direct verification shows that M has no non-zero b-highest weight vector
and is therefore not a b-highest weight module.
   For any irreducible weight module M there is the following natural question:
what are the integrable root directions of M , i.e. for which roots α ∈ ∆ is M an
integrable gα -module? It is a remarkable fact that if ∆int   M is the set of all roots α
for which M is gα -integrable, then pint
                                      M  := h ⊕ (⊕ α∈∆M int g α
                                                                ) is a Lie subalgebra of g,
      int
and pM is nothing but the subset of elements in g which act locally finitely on M .
For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra this can be proved using Gabber’s theorem,
[G], see Corollary 2.7 in [Fe] or Proposition 1 in [PS]. For a root direct limit Lie
algebra the statement follows immediately from the case of a finite-dimensional Lie
algebra.
                                                   +
Proposition 7. (i) pint       F      I    int
                       M = (gM + (gM ∩ pM )) ⊕ gM .
   (ii) If M is a pseudo highest weight module, then pint                     int
                                                      M = pM ; in particular pM is
a parabolic subalgebra of g.
                                         int   +      int               int −
   Proof. (i) It is obvious that gFM ⊂ pM and gM ⊂ pM . Furthermore, pM ∩gM = 0.
                          −      int                       α
Indeed, assuming that gM ∩ pM 6= 0 we would have that g acts locally nilpotently
on M for some α ∈ ∆−      M , which is impossible as then suppM would have to be
invariant with respect to the reflection σα ∈ W . Since pint        int
                                                            M ⊃ h, pM is a weight
                                                   +                          +
submodule of g and pint        int     F     I            F     I     int
                        M = pM ∩ ((gM + gM ) ⊕ gM ) = (gM + (gM ∩ pM )) ⊕ gM .
   (ii) The statement follows immediately from (i) since gIM = h ⊂ gF
                                                                    M for a pseudo
highest weight module M .
   The following Proposition provides a more explicit description of pM = pint   M
for highest weight modules. It is a version of the main result of [DP2] adapted to
highest weight modules with respect to arbitrary Borel subalgebras a root reductive
Lie algebra g. If M = Vb (λ), we say that a root α ∈ ∆− is M -simple iff α = β + γ
with β, γ ∈ ∆− implies hλ, βi = 0 or hλ, γi = 0.
Proposition 8. Let M = Vb (λ) and let Σint  λ,b be the set of all M -simple roots
δ ∈ ∆− for which M is gδ -integrable. Then, for any α ∈ ∆− , M is gα -integrable
(equivalently, α ∈ ∆− ∩ ∆F             int
                         M ) iff α ∈< Σλ,b >Z+ .

   Proof. Proposition 7, (ii) implies that if α ∈< Σint                  α
                                                      λ,b >Z+ then M is g -integrable.
                          α
Let, conversely, M be g -integrable. If α is not M -simple, then α = β + γ for some
β, γ ∈ ∆− with hλ, βi =  6 0 and hλ, γi =
                                        6 0. The reader will then check that | hλ, αi |
is strictly bigger than both | hλ, βi | and | hλ, γi |. Choose n big enough so that
α, β, γ ∈ ∆n . Applying the main Theorem from [DP2] to Vbn (λ|hn ), we obtain
that Vbn (λ|hn ) is both gβ -integrable and gγ -integrable. Therefore M is also gβ -
integrable as well as gγ -integrable. To conclude that α ∈< Σint   λ,b >Z+ whenever
Vb (λ) is gα -integrable one applies now induction on | hλ, αi |.
   Although the parabolic induction theorem does not hold for pseudo highest
weight modules, their supports can be described explicitly. In the next section we
prove a general theorem describing the support of any irreducible weight module.

An open question about pseudo highest weight modules is whether the statement
(ii) of Theorem 6 extends to any pseudo highest weight module, i.e. whether such
a module is determined up to an isomorphism by its support.

      6. The support of an arbitrary irreducible weight module
   Let M be an arbitrary irreducible weight module M with corresponding partition
                    +       −
∆ = ∆F       I
       M ⊔ ∆M ⊔ ∆M ⊔ ∆M . Define the small Weyl group W
                                                              F
                                                                  of M as the Weyl
group of gM . For λ ∈ h , set KM := (W · λ)+ < ∆M >Z + < ∆−
           F              ∗       λ         F          I
                                                                       M >Z+ and
  λ,n
KM    := ((W F ∩ Wn ) · λ)+ < ∆IM ∩ ∆n >Z + < ∆−  M ∩ ∆  n > Z+ .
Lemma 3. For any λ0 ∈ suppM and any n, there exists λ ∈ suppM such that
                           λ,n
(λ0 + < ∆n >R ) ∩ suppM = KM   .
   Proof. If ∆n ⊂ ∆IM , set λ = λ0 . Assume now that ∆n 6⊂ ∆IM . Consider the cone
                 +
K :=< ∆F   M ∪ ∆M >R+ . Then (λ0 + K) ∩ (suppM ∩ < ∆n >R ) is a finite set. As
in the proof of Theorem 2, suppM = ∪N suppMN for some irreducible gN -modules
MN . Furthermore, there is N0 for which suppMN0 ⊃ (λ0 + K) ∩ (suppM ∩ <
∆n >R ). Let λ ∈ suppMN0 ∩ < ∆n >R be such that λ + α 6∈ suppMN0 for any
                    +
α ∈ ∆n ∩ (∆F  M ∪ ∆M ). (Such a weight λ exists because otherwise we would have
         I                                                 λ,n
∆n ⊂ ∆M .) Clearly then (λ0 + < ∆n >R ) ∩ suppM = KM           .
                                      F    I      +
   Fix now a Borel subalgebra b ⊂ (gM + gM ) ⊕ gM of g and let λ ∈ suppM . Then
Lemma 3 enables us to construct a sequence λ3 , λ4 , . . . , λn , . . . such that λ3 = λ
and λn is such that
                                         +      +
- λn + α 6∈ suppM for any α ∈ (∆F   M ∪ ∆M ) ∩ ∆ ;
                                 λ,n
- (λ1 + < ∆n >R ) ∩ suppM = KM , for n ≥ 4.
This sequence reconstructs suppM and is, in a certain sense, assigned naturally
to M . For a precise formulation, define an equivalence relation ∼M on h∗ by
setting λ1 ∼M λ2 iff there exists w ∈ W F such that w(λ1 ) − λ2 ∈< ∆IM >Z . Let
furthermore h∗M denote the set of ∼M -equivalence classes and let p : h∗ 7→ h∗M be
the natural projection.
   The following theorem is our most general result describing suppM for an ar-
bitrary irreducible weight g-module M . It is a straightforward corollary of the
construction of the sequence {λn }.
                                                          λn
Theorem 8. (i) K λ1 ⊂ K λ2 ⊂ . . . and suppM = ∪n KM          .
   (ii) The sequence {p(λn )} depends on λ only, and if λ′ is another element of
suppM , there is n0 so that p(λn ) = p(λ′n ) for all n > n0 .
   (ii) If M̂ is an irreducible weight g-module with corresponding sequence {λ cn },
                                                                c
then suppM = suppM̂ iff the there is n0 such that p(λn ) = p(λn ) for n > n0 .

                                                                          λn
   The existence of a sequence of weights {λn } for which suppM = ∪n KM      follows
directly from the fact that suppM = ∪n suppMn for some irreducible gn -modules
Mn (see the proof of Theorem 2). The main advantage of constructing the sequence
{λn } is that M stably determines the sequence {p(λn )}. It is an open question
to describe explicitly all possible sequences {p(λn )}, or equivalently all possible
supports of irreducible weight g-modules with a given shadow.

Appendix. Borel subalgebras of g and chains of subspaces in < ∆ >R
   In this Appendix g is an arbitrary Lie algebra with a fixed Cartan subalgebra
h such that g admits a root decomposition (1). Here we establish a precise inter-
relationship between Borel subalgebras b of g containing h (which we call simply
Borel subalgebras), R-linear orders on < ∆ >R , and oriented maximal chains of
vector subspaces in < ∆ >R . Our motivation is the following. If g has finitely
many roots (i.e. for instance, if g is finite-dimensional), every Borel subalgebra is
defined by a (non-unique) regular hyperplane H in < ∆ >R , i.e. by a hyperplane
H such that H ∩ ∆ = ∅. If g has infinitely many roots this is known to be no longer
true (i.e. in general there are Borel subalgebras which do not correspond to any
regular hyperplane in < ∆ >R 2 ) and in [DP1] we have shown that in the case when
< ∆ >R is finite-dimensional every Borel subalgebra can be defined by a maximal
flag of linear subspaces in < ∆ >R . However, when < ∆ >R is infinite-dimensional,
the situation is more complicated and deserves a careful formulation.
   We start by stating the relationship between Borel subalgebras b with b ⊃ h and
R-linear orders on < ∆ >R .
Proposition 9. Every R-linear order on < ∆ >R determines a unique Borel sub-
algebra, and conversely, every Borel subalgebra is determined by an (in general not
unique) R-linear order on < ∆ >R .
   Proof. If > is an R-linear order on < ∆ >R , set ∆± := {α ∈ ∆ | ± α > 0}. Then
∆ ⊔∆− is a triangular decomposition and thus > determines the Borel subalgebra
  +

h ⊕ (⊕α∈∆+ gα ). The proof of the converse statement is left to the reader (it is a
standard application of Zorn’s Lemma).
   In what follows we establish a bijection between R-linear orders on < ∆ >R and
oriented maximal chains of vector subspaces in < ∆ >R . If V is any real vector
space, a chain of vector subspaces of V is defined as a set of subspaces F = {Fα }α∈A
of V such that α 6= β implies a proper inclusion Fα ⊂ Fβ or Fβ ⊂ Fα . The set A
is then automatically ordered. A chain F is a flag iff as an ordered set A can be
identified with a (finite or infinite) interval in Z. A chain F is maximal iff it is not
properly contained in any other chain. Maximal chains of linear subspaces may be
somewhat counterintuitive as the following example shows that a linear space of
countable dimension admits non-countable maximal chains and vise versa.
   Example 6. Let V be a countable-dimensional space with a basis {er }r∈Q . The
chain of all subspaces Vt :=< {er | r < t} >R for t ∈ R, Vr′ :=< {er | r ≤ r} >R
for r ∈ Q, V−∞ := 0 and V∞ := V is a maximal chain of cardinality continuum.
Let U := C[[x]] be the space of formal power series in the indeterminate x. The
dimension of U is continuum, however {0} ∪ F , F being the flag {Fi := xi W }i∈Z+ ,
provides an example of a countable maximal chain in U .
   Furthermore, it turns out that every maximal chain is determined uniquely by
a certain subchain. Define a chain F to be basic iff it is minimal with the following
property: for every x ∈ V there exists a pair Fα ⊂ Fβ ∈ F with dimFβ /Fα = 1
such that x ∈ Fβ \Fα .
Lemma 4. Every maximal chain in V admits a unique basic subchain and con-
versely, every basic chain is contained in a unique maximal chain.
  2 This   is the case for any Kac-Moody algebra which is not finite-dimensional.
                WEIGHT MODULES OF DIRECT LIMIT LIE ALGEBRAS                         19


   Proof. Let F = {Fα }α∈A be a maximal chain in V . For every non-zero x ∈ V
set Fx := ∪x6∈Fα Fα and Fx′ := Fx ⊕ Rx. Then F ∪ {Fx , Fx′ } is a chain in V and
hence Fx , Fx′ ∈ F . Let G := ∪06=x∈V {Fx , Fx′ }. Then G is obviously a basic chain
contained in F . Noting that G consists exactly of all pairs of subspaces from F with
relative codimension one, we conclude that G is the unique basic chain contained
in F .
   Let now G = {Gβ }β∈B be a basic chain in V and let < be the corresponding
order on B. A subset C of B is a cut of B if α ∈ C and β < α implies β ∈ C, and
if α ∈ C and β 6∈ C implies β > α. The set B̄ of all cuts of B is naturally ordered.
Set Hα := ∪β∈α Gβ for α ∈ B̄. One checks immediately that H = {Hα }α∈B̄ is
a maximal chain in V which contains G. On the other hand, given any maximal
chain F = {Fα }α∈A in V containing G, one notices that Fα = ∪Gβ ⊂Fα Gβ . Then
the map ϕ : A → B̄, ϕ(α) := {β | Gβ ⊂ Fα } is an embedding of F into H and hence
F = H. The Lemma is proved.
   An orientation of a basic chain G is a labeling of the two half-spaces of Gβ \Gα
for every pair of indices α < β with dimGβ /Gα = 1, by mutually opposite signs
±. An orientation of a maximal chain F is an orientation of its basic subchain. A
maximal chain F is oriented iff an orientation of F is fixed.
Theorem 9. There is a bijection between oriented maximal chains in < ∆ >R and
R-linear orders on < ∆ >R .
   Proof. Lemma 4 implies that it is enough to establish a bijection between oriented
basic chains in < ∆ >R and R-linear orders on < ∆ >R .
   Let G be an oriented basic chain in < ∆ >R . We define an R-linear order >G
on < ∆ >R by setting x >G 0 or x <G 0 according to the sign of the half-space
of Gβ \Gα to which x belongs. Conversely, given an R-linear order > on < ∆ >R
we build the corresponding oriented basic chain as follows. For a non-zero vector
x ∈ V we set Vx := {y ∈ V | ± (cy + x) > 0 iff ± x > 0}. Then for every pair of
non-zero vectors x, y ∈ V exactly one of the following is true: Vx = Vy , Vx ⊂ Vy
or Vx ⊃ Vy . Therefore the set of distinct subspaces among {Vx } is a chain F . The
very construction of F shows that it is a basic chain in < ∆ >R . To complete the
proof of the Theorem it remains to orient this chain in the obvious way.
   Finally we define a decomposition of ∆,
                                ∆ = ∆− ⊔ ∆0 ⊔ ∆+ ,                                (8)
to be parabolic iff Π(∆ )∩Π(∆ ) = ∅, 0 6∈ Π(∆ ) and Π(∆)\{0} = Π(∆ )⊔Π(∆+ )
                      −        +                ±                         −

is a triangular decomposition of Π(∆)\{0} (i.e. the cone < Π(∆+ ) ∪ −Π(∆− ) >R+
contains no vector subspace), where Π is the projection < ∆ >R →< ∆ >R / <
∆0 >R . If ∆0 = ∅, a parabolic decomposition is a triangular decomposition. Given
a parabolic decomposition (8), its corresponding parabolic subalgebra is by definition
p := h ⊕ (⊕α∈∆0 ⊔∆+ gα ).
   Given a linear subspace V ′ in V , we define a V ′ -maximal chain of vector sub-
spaces in V to be the preimage in V of a maximal chain in V /V ′ . An V ′ -maximal
chain is oriented iff the corresponding maximal chain in V /V ′ is oriented. Gener-
alizing the corresponding construction for Borel subalgebras, we have
Theorem 10. Any parabolic decomposition (8) is determined by some oriented
< ∆0 >R -maximal chain of vector subspaces in V , and conversely any oriented
V ′ -maximal chain in < ∆ >R , for an arbitrary subspace V ′ of < ∆ >R , defines a
unique parabolic decomposition of ∆ with ∆0 = ∆ ∩ V ′ .
