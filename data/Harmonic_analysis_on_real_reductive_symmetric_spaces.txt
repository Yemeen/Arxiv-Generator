                                             1.     Introduction
                                                  Let G be a real reductive group in the Harish-Chandra class [H-C1], e.g. a
                                             connected semisimple Lie group with finite center, or the group of real points of a
                                             connected reductive algebraic group defined over R. Let σ be an involution of the
                                             Lie group G, H an open subgroup of the subgroup of fixed points of σ.
                                                  Important problems of harmonic analysis on the so-called reductive symmetric
                                             space G/H are :
                                                  (a) to make the simultaneous spectral decomposition of the elements of the
                                             algebra D(G/H) of left invariant differential operators under G on G/H. In other
                                             words, one wants to write the elements of L2 (G/H) with the help of joint eigen-
                                             functions under D(G/H).
                                                  (b) to decompose the left regular representation of G in L2 (G/H) into an
                                             Hilbert integral of irreducible unitary representations of G : this is essentially the
                                             Plancherel formula.

      (c) to decompose the Dirac measure at eH, where e is the neutral element of
G, into an integral of H-fixed distribution vectors : this is essentially the Fourier
inversion formula.
      These problems were solved for the “group case” (i.e. the group viewed as a
symmetric space : G = G1 × G1 , σ(x, y) = (y, x), H is the diagonal of G1 × G1
) by Harish-Chandra in 1970s (see [H-C1,2, 3]), the Riemannian case (H maximal
compact) had been treated before (see [He]). Later, there were deep results by T.
Oshima [O1]. When G is a complex group and H is a real form, the Problems (a),
(b), (c) were solved by P. Harinck, together with an inversion formula for orbital
integrals ([Ha], see also [D3] for the link of her work with the work of A. Bouaziz
on real reductive groups).
      Then, E. van den Ban and H. Schlichtkrull, on the one hand, and I, on the other
hand, obtained different solutions to problems (a), (b), (c). Moreover, they obtained
a Paley-Wiener theorem (see [BS3] for a presentation of their work). I present here
my point of view, with an emphasize on problem (a), because it simplifies the
formulations of the results (nevertherless, the important aspect of representation
theory is hidden). It includes several joint works, mainly with J. Carmona , and
also with E. van den Ban and J.L. Brylinski. Severals works of T. Oshima, linked
to the the Flensted-Jensen duality, alone and with T. Matsuki are very important
in my proof, as well as earlier results of E. van den Ban and H. Schlichtkrull.
      I have to acknowledge the deep influence of Harish-Chandra ’s work. The
crucial role played by the work [Be] of J. Bernstein on the support of the Plancherel
measure, and some part of Arthur’s article on the local trace formula [A] will be
appearant in the main body of the article.


2.     Temperedness of the spectrum
      Let θ be a Cartan involution of G commuting with σ, let K be the fixed point
set of θ. Let g be the Lie algebra of G, etc. Let s (resp. q) be the space of elements in
g which are antiinvariant under the differential of θ (resp. σ). Let a∅ be a maximal
abelian subspace of s ∩ q. If P is a σθ-stable parabolic subgroup of G, containing
A∅ := exp a∅ , we denote by P = MP AP NP its Langlands σ-decomposition. More
precisely AP is the subgroup of the elements a of the split component of the Levi
factor LP = P ∩ θ(P ) such that σ(a) = a−1 . Here MP is larger than that for the
usual Langlands decomposition.
      In order to simplify the exposition we will make the following simplifying
assumption:
Hypothesis: For any P as above, HP is the unique open (H, P )-double coset.
      When σ = θ (the case of a riemannian symmetric space ) or the “group case”,
this hypothesis is satisfied.
      To get the Plancherel formula, it is useful to use K-finite functions. They are
often replaced by τ -spherical functions. Here (τ, Vτ ) is a finite dimensional unitary
representation of K and a τ -spherical function on G/H is a function f : G/H → Vτ
such that f (kx) = τ (k)f (x), k ∈ K, x ∈ G/H.
            Harmonic Analysis on Real Reductive Symmetric Spaces                      547


      Some spaces of τ -spherical functions on G/H play a crucial role in the theory,
namely:
      (a) C(G/H, τ ) : the Schwartz space of τ -spherical functions on G/H which are
rapidly decreasing as well as their derivatives by elements of the enveloping algebra
U (g) of g (see [B2]).
      (b) A(G/H, τ ): the space of smooth τ -spherical functions on G/H which are
D(G/H) finite. Here A is used to evoke automorphic forms.
      (c) Atemp (G/H, τ ): the space of elements of A(G/H, τ ) which have tem-
pered growth as well as their derivatives by elements of U (g) ([D2]). Integration of
functions on G/H defines a pairing between Atemp (G/H, τ ) and C(G/H, τ ).
      (d) A2 (G/H, τ ): the space of square integrable elements of A(G/H, τ ). This
is a subspace of the three preceeding spaces.
      One has:
Theorem 1 ( [D2] ): The space A2 (G/H, τ ) is finite dimensional.
      This is deduced from the theory of discrete series for G/H initiated by M.
Flensted-Jensen [F-J] and achieved by T. Oshima and T. Matsuki, using the Flensted-
Jensen duality [OM]. One has also to use the behaviour of the discrete series under
certain translation functors, studied by D. Vogan [V] and a result of H. Schlichtkrull
[S] on the minimal K-types of certain discrete series.
      The next result follows from the work of J. Bernstein [Be] on the support of
the Plancherel measure.
Theorem 2 ([CD1], Appendice C): Every function in C(G/H, τ ) can be canonically
desintegrated as an integral of elements of Atemp (G/H, τ ).
      This information appeared to be crucial at the end of our proof.


3.     The continuous spectrum: Eisenstein integrals
     Let P = M AN the Langlands σ-decomposition of a σθ-stable parabolic sub-
group P of G. Let ρP be the half sum of the roots of a in n and λ ∈ a∗C be such that
the real part of λ − ρP is strictly dominant with respect to the roots of a in n. Let
τM be the restriction of τ to M ∩ K. Then, if x ∈ G/H and ψ ∈ A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM ),
the following integral is convergent:
                                         Z
                        E(P, ψ, λ)(x) :=    τ (k −1 )Ψλ (kx)dk,
                                            K

where Ψλ (x) = 0 if x ∈   / P H, and Ψλ (x) = a−λ+ρP ψ(m) if x = namH with n ∈ N ,
a ∈ A, m ∈ M . Moreover E(P, ψ, λ) is an element of A(G/H, τ ). Eisenstein
integrals are the τ -spherical versions of K-finite functions of the form: gH 7→<
π ′ (g)ξ, v >, where π ′ is the contragredient of a generalized principal series π, ξ is a
certain H-fixed distribution vector of π, v is a K-finite vector of π.
Theorem 3 ([BrD]): The function λ 7→ E(P, ψ, λ) admits a meromorphic con-
tinuation in λ ∈ a∗C . This meromorphic continuation, denoted in the same way,
multiplied by a suitable product, pψ , of functions of type λ 7→ (α, λ) + c, where α is
a root of a and c ∈ C, is holomorphic around ia∗ .
548                                 Patrick Delorme


      This meromorphic continuation is an interesting feature of the theory. For the
the “group case”, it comes down to the meromorphic continuation of Knapp-Stein
intertwining integrals. My proof with Brylinski uses D-modules arguments.
      The case where P is minimal had been treated separately by E. van den Ban
[B1] and G. Olafsson [Ol]. One has also to mention the earlier work of T. Oshima
and J. Sekiguchi [OSe] on the spaces of type G/Kε .
      The proof which gives the best results uses a method of tensoring by finite
dimensional representations. It is a joint work with J. Carmona. It was initiated by
D. Vogan and N. Wallach (see [W], chapter 10) for the meromorphic continuation
of the Knapp-Stein intertwining integrals. For symmetric spaces and the most
continuous spectrum, the proof is due to E. van den Ban [B2]. This proof uses
Bruhat’s thesis and tensoring by finite dimensional modules. This implies rough
estimates for Eisenstein integrals, which generalize those obtained by E. van den
Ban when P is minimal [B2].
Theorem 4 ([D1]): If λ ∈ ia∗ is such that E(P, ψ, λ) is well defined, then it is
tempered, i.e. is an element of Atemp (G/H, τ ).
      This is a natural result but the proof is quite long. It uses the behaviour
under translation functors of H-fixed distribution vectors of discrete series and of
generalized principal series, and also of the Poisson transform. Moreover the duality
of M. Flensted-Jensen, [F-J], and a criteria of temperedness due to Oshima [O2] play
a crucial role (apparently, J. Carmona has a way to avoid boundary values).
      With the help of this theorem and by using techniques due to E. van den Ban
[B2], the rough estimates for Eisenstein integrals can be improved to get uniform
sharp estimates for pψ (λ)E(P, ψ, λ), λ ∈ ia∗ (cf. [D1]).


4.    C-functions
      Let P be as above and let L be equal to M A. The theory of the constant
term, due to J. Carmona [C1] (Harish-Chandra for the group case, [H-C1]), gives a
linear map from Atemp (G/H, τ ) into Atemp (L/L ∩ H, τL ), ϕ 7→ ϕP , characterized
by :
                     1/2
           limt→+∞ δP ((exp tX)l)ϕ((exp tX)l) − ϕP ((exp tX)l) = 0,
where l ∈ L/L ∩ H, X ∈ aP is P -dominant and δP is the modular function of P .
     Let Q be a σθ-stable parabolic subgroup of G with the same θ-stable Levi
subgroup L other than P . Let W (a) be the group of automorphisms of a induced
by an element of Ad(G). One defines meromorphic functions on a∗C , λ 7→ CQ|P (s, λ)
with values in End(A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM )) such that :
                        X
    E(P, ψ, λ)Q (ma) =       (CQ|P (s, λ)ψ)(m)a−sλ , m ∈ M, a ∈ A, λ ∈ ia∗ ,
                        s∈W (a)

or rather for λ in an open dense subset of ia∗ .
     The C-functions allow to normalize Eisenstein integrals as folllows:

                      E 0 (P, ψ, λ) := E(P, CP |P (1, λ)−1 ψ, λ).

5.     Truncation, Maass-Selberg relations and the reg-
       ularity of normalized Eisenstein integrals
     Let P be as above and let P ′ = M ′ A′ N ′ be the Langlands σ-decomposition
of another σθ-stable parabolic subgroup of G. Let ψ (resp. ψ ′ ) be an element of
A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM ) (resp. A2 (M ′ /M ′ ∩ H, τM ′ )). One chooses pψ as in Theorem 3,
such that the product of pψ with the C-functions are holomorphic in a neighbour-
hood of ia∗ which is a product of ia∗ with a neighbourhood of 0 in a∗ . We do the
same for ψ ′ . One defines F (λ) := pψ (λ)E(P, ψ, λ). One defines similarly F ′ .
     One assumes, for the rest of the article, that G is semisimple. This is just to
simplify the exposition. One chooses T ∈ a∅ , regular with respect to the roots of
a∅ in g. Let CT1 be the convex hull of W (a∅ )T and let CT be equal to the subset
K(exp CT1 )H of G/H.
Theorem 5 ([D2]):
     (i) One gets an explicit expression ω T (λ, λ′ ), involving the C-functions (see an
example below) and vanishing when A and A′ are not conjugate under K, which is
asymptotic to                       Z
                               ′
                        T
                       Ω (λ, λ ) :=      (F (λ)(x), F ′ (λ′ )(x))dx,
                                            CT

when T goes to infinity and λ ∈ ia , λ′ ∈ ia′∗ . More precisely for δ > 0 there exists
                                        ∗

C > 0, k ∈ N and ε > 0, such that for all T satisfying | α(T ) |≥ δ || T || for every
root α of a∅ in g, one has:

             | ΩT (λ, λ′ ) − ω T (λ, λ′ ) |≤ C(1+ || λ ||)k (1+ || λ′ ||)k e−ε||T || .


       (ii) Moreover ω T is analytic in (λ, λ′ ) ∈ ia∗ × ia′∗ .
This generalizes a result of J. Arthur for the group case [A], Theorem 8.1. My proof
is quite similar, but I was able to avoid his use of the Plancherel formula.
       (ii) is an easy consequence of (i). In fact, the explicit form of ω T implies that
it is meromorphic around ia∗ × ia′∗ . Moreover ΩT is holomorphic, hence locally
bounded, around ia∗ × ia′∗ . From the inequality in (i), one deduces that ω T is
locally bounded, hence holomorphic, around ia∗ × ia′∗ .
       We will now show, by an example, how the explicit form of ω T and its analyt-
icity in (λ, λ′ ) ∈ ia∗ × ia′∗ imply the Maass-Selberg relations.
       Let σ be equal to θ, H = K, and τ be the trivial representation. Let P, P ′
be minimal parabolic subgroups of G. Then dimA2 (M/M ∩ H, τ ) = 1 and the C-
functions are scalar valued. One assumes g to be semisimple and that the dimension
of A is one. Then W (a) has 2 elements, ±1, and one has the following explicit
expression of ω T :
                                 X              ′ ′
 ω T (λ, λ′ ) = pψ (λ)pψ′ (λ′ )         esλT −s λ T CP |P (s, λ)CP |P (s′ , λ′ )(sλ − s′ λ′ )−1 .
                             s=±1,s′ =±1


Thus ω T (λ, λ′ ) is the sum of a product of (λ − λ′ )−1 by an analytic function with
a product of (λ + λ′ )−1 by an analytic function. The analyticity at (λ, λ) implies
550                                   Patrick Delorme


easily that the factor in front of (λ − λ′ )−1 vanishes for λ = λ′ . Hence we get
| CP |P (1, λ) |2 =| CP |P (−1, λ) |2 , λ ∈ ia∗ . This is one of the Maass-Selberg rela-
tions(cf. [D2], Theorem 2, and the work with J. Carmona [CD2], Theorem 2 for the
general case, see [B1], [B2] for the case where P is minimal). These relations imply
that the C-functions attached to normalized Eisenstein integrals are unitary, when
defined, for λ purely imaginary. Hence they are locally bounded . This implies that
they are holomorphic around the imaginary axis. This implies in particular some
holomorphy property of the constant term of normalized Eisentein integrals. From
this, with the help of [BCD], one deduces:
Theorem 6 (Regularity theorem for normalized Eisenstein integrals, [CD2], [BS1]
for P minimal): The normalized Eisenstein integrals are holomorphic in a neigh-
bourhood of the imaginary axis.


6.     Fourier transform and wave packets
Theorem 7 ([CD2], [BS1] for P minimal): For f ∈ C(G/H, τ ), one has FP0 f ∈
S(ia∗ ) ⊗ A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM ), where FP0 f is characterized by:
                   Z
((FP0 f )(λ), ψ) =   (f (x), E 0 (P, ψ, λ)(x))dx, λ ∈ ia∗ , ψ ∈ A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM ),
                   G/H

         ∗
here S(ia ) is the usual Schwartz space.
      This theorem follows from the sharp estimates of Eisenstein integrals.
Theorem 8 ([BCD]): If Ψ is an element of S(ia∗ ) ⊗ A2 (M/M ∩ H, τM ), one has
I0P ∈ C(G/H, τ ), where :
                               Z
                    I0P (x) :=    E 0 (P, Ψ(λ), λ)dλ, x ∈ G/H.
                                ia∗


     This theorem follows from the regularity theorem and from the joint work with
E. van den Ban and J. Carmona, [BCD].
     Now we want to compute FP0 ′ I0P . For this purpose one has to study the integral:
                 Z     Z
            I :=      (     α(λ)E 0 (P, ψ, λ)(x)dλ, E 0 (P ′ , ψ ′ , λ′ )(x))dx.
                   G/H    ia∗

     One truncates the integral on G/H to CT and let T goes to infinity (far from
the walls). Let us denote the truncated inner product of the normalized Eisenstein
integrals by 0 ΩT (λ, λ′ ). Using Fubini’s theorem one has:
                                        Z
                           I = limT →∞       α(λ)0 ΩT (λ, λ′ )dλ.
                                        ia∗

As for unnormalized Eisentein integrals, one has an asymptotic evaluation of
 Ω (λ, λ′ ) by an explicit expression 0 ω T (λ, λ′ ). One can replace 0 ΩT by 0 ω T in
0 T

the previous formula. By using an expression of 0 ω T (λ, λ′ ), viewed as a distribu-
tion in λ, for fixed λ′ , involving Fourier transforms of cones ( [D2], Theorem 3) one
gets:

Theorem 9 ([CD2]): Let F be a set of representative of σ-association classes of
σθ-stable parabolic subgroups. Here σ-association means that the a are conjugated
under K. Define:                 X
                            Pτ =    ((W (aP ))−1 I0P FP0 .
                                  P ∈F

Then Pτ is an orthogonal projection operator in C(G/H, τ ) endowed with the L2
scalar product.


7.    The Plancherel formula
      Essentially, the solution to problem (a) is contained in the following:
Theorem 10 ([D4]): The projection Pτ is the identity operator on C(G/H, τ ).
      Actually, this gives an expression of every element in C(G/H, τ ) as a wave
packet of normalized Eisenstein integrals. The proof goes as follows. If Pτ was not
the identity, using Theorem 1 on the temperedness of the spectrum, one could find
a non zero element of Atemp (G/H, τ ) which is orthogonal to the image of Pτ . Then,
generalizing Theorem 5 to the truncated inner product of an Eisenstein integral with
a general element of Atemp (G/H, τ ), this orthogonality can be explicitely described
(cf. the evaluation of I before Theorem 9). As a result, this function has to be zero,
a contradiction which proves the theorem.
      The theorem translates to K-finite functions, involving representations and
H-fixed distribution vectors.
      The theorem can also be expressed with the unnormalized Eisenstein integrals.
Then there are certain Plancherel factors involved. They are linked, as in the
group case , to the intertwining integrals. Following the approach of A.Knapp and
G.Zuckerman, [KZ], their computation is reduced to find an embedding of discrete
series into principal series attached to minimal parabolic subgroups. For connected
groups, this has been done by J. Carmona [C2].


8.    Applications and open problems
Schwartz space for the hypergeometric Fourier transform
      The image of a natural Schwartz space by the hypergeometric Fourier trans-
form is characterized [D5]. The work uses the Plancherel formula of E. Opdam [Op],
and the techniques mentioned above : theory of the constant term, C-functions,
truncation ...
Generalized Schur orthogonality relations
      Using the Plancherel formula for reductive symmetric spaces groups, K. Ank-
about, [An], has proved generalized Schur orthogonality relations for generalized
coefficients related to real reductive symmetric spaces. In particular, at least if we
assume multiplicity one in the Plancherel formula, it implies the following:
      There exists an explicit positive function d on G/H, such that, for almost all
representations π occuring in the Plancherel formula, for ξ an H-fixed distribution
vector of π occuring in the decomposition of the Dirac measure, there exists an
552                                 Patrick Delorme


explicit non zero constant Cπ such that, for all v, v ′ , K-finite vectors in the space
of π:
                   Z
          lim ε nπ
                        e−εd(x) < π ′ (g)ξ, v > < π ′ (g)ξ, v ′ >dx = Cπ (v, v ′ ).
         ε→0+       G/H


      Here nπ is the dimension of the support of the Plancherel decomposition,
around π. This refines and generalizes a work of Mirodikawa. It suggests to look
for such type of relations in other situations.

D(G/H)-finite τ -spherical functions on reductive symmetric spaces
       S. Souaifi [So] showed how these functions appear as linear combinations of
derivatives along the complex parameter λ, of Eisenstein integrals. For K-finite
functions, filtrations are introduced, whose subquotients are described in terms of
induced representations. The starting point is an adaptation of ideas used by J.
Franke to study spaces of automorphic forms. The use of the spectral decomposition
by Langlands is replaced here by the use of the Plancherel formula. For reductive
p-adic groups, and for the group case, I got similar results.
Invariant harmonic analysis on real reductive symmetric spaces
       The goal is to study the H-invariant eigendistributions under D(G/H) on G/H
and to express invariant measures on certain H-orbits in terms of these distributions
( cf [D3] for the work of A.Bouaziz and P.Harinck for the group case and G(C)/G(R),
see also [OSe]).
Harmonic analysis on p-adic reductive symmetric spaces
       For the group case, the Problems (b) and (c) of the Introduction have been
solved by Harish-Chandra, up to the explicit description of the discrete series. In
general, the problems are open (see [HH] for interesting structural results).
