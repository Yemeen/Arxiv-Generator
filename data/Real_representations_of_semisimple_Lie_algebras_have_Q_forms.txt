                                                        To Professor M. S. Raghunathan on his sixtieth birthday

                                                    Abstract. We prove that each real semisimple Lie algebra g has a
                                                    Q-form gQ , such that every real representation of gQ can be realized
                                                    over Q. This was previously proved by M. S. Raghunathan (and
                                                    rediscovered by P. Eberlein) in the special case where g is compact.




                                                                          1. Introduction
                                               All Lie algebras and all representations are assumed to be finite-
                                             dimensional. It is easy to see, from the theory of highest weights,
                                             that if g is an R-split, semisimple Lie algebra over R, then every C-
                                             representation of g has an R-form (see 3.1). (That is, if VC is a repre-
                                             sentation of g over C, then there is a real representation V of g, such
                                             that VC ∼= V ⊗R C.) Because every semisimple Lie algebra over C has
                                             an R-split real form, this leads to the following immediate conclusion:
                                             1.1. Remark. Any complex semisimple Lie algebra gC has a real
                                             form g, such that every C-representation of g has a real form.
                                               In this paper, we prove the analogous statement with the field ex-
                                             tension C/R replaced with R/Q.
                                             1.2. Theorem (see 2.6(2)). Any real semisimple Lie algebra g has a
                                             Q-form gQ , such that every real representation of gQ has a Q-form.
                                               In the special case where g is compact, the theorem was proved
                                             by M. S. Raghunathan [R2, §3]. This special case was independently
                                             rediscovered by P. Eberlein [E], and a very nice proof was found by
                                             R. Pink and G. Prasad (personal communication, see §4). When g is
                                             compact, these authors showed that the “obvious” Q-form of g has the
                                             desired property.

                                               Date: 17 December 2002.
                                               Submitted in May 2002 to the proceedings of the conference Algebraic Groups
                                             and Arithmetic (Mumbai, India, 17-22 December 2001). Revised December 2002.

   At the other extreme, where g is R-split, we may take gQ to be any
Q-split Q-form of g (see 3.1).
   The general case is a combination of the two extremes, and the de-
sired Q-form can be obtained from a Chevalley basis of g ⊗R C by
slightly modifying a construction of A. Borel [B] (see §6). We give two
different proofs that this Q-form has the desired property: one proof is
by the method of Pink and Prasad, using a little bit of number theory
(see §4), and the other proof is by reducing to the compact case, so
Raghunathan’s theorem applies (see §5).
   It would be interesting to characterize the semisimple Lie algebras
gQ over Q, such that every real representation has a Q-form. For
example, work of J. Tits [T] implies that every Q-form of sp(n) has
this property (see 7.2). On the other hand, it is important to note that
there exist examples of Q(i)-split Lie algebras that do not have this
property (see 7.4). (Real representations of such a Lie algebra can be
realized over both Q(i) and R, but not over Q(i) ∩ R = Q.)

       2. More precise statement of the main result
2.1. Proposition (Pink, Prasad, see §4). Suppose G is a connected,
reductive algebraic Q-group. If
    (a) G is split over some imaginary quadratic extension F of Q, and
    (b) G is quasi-split over the p-adic field Qp , for every odd prime p,
                REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                        3

then each irreducible Q-representation of G remains irreducible over R.
  This can be restated in the following equivalent form.
2.2. Definition. Suppose (π, V ) is a real representation of an algebraic
Q-group G. A Q-subspace VQ of VR is a Q-form of (π, V ) if
     • VQ is GQ -invariant, and
     • VQ is the Q-span of an R-basis of VR (so VR ∼  = VQ ⊗Q R).
2.3. Corollary (see 3.3). If G is as in Prop. 2.1, then every real rep-
resentation of G has a Q-form.
2.4. Proposition (see §6). Every connected, simply connected, semisim-
ple real algebraic group has a Q-form satisfying the hypotheses of Prop. 2.1.
  Combining Prop. 2.4 with Prop. 2.1 and Cor. 2.3 immediately yields
the following conclusion.
2.5. Definition. Suppose
     • gQ is a Lie algebra over Q, and
     • (π, V ) is a real representation of gQ .
A Q-subspace VQ of V is a Q-form of (π, V ) if
     • VQ is gQ -invariant, and
     • VQ is the Q-span of an R-basis of V (so V ∼
                                                 = VQ ⊗Q R).
2.6. Corollary. Any real semisimple Lie algebra g has a Q-form gQ ,
such that
    (1) if VQ is any irreducible Q-representation of gQ , then the R-
        representation VR = VQ ⊗Q R is irreducible; and
    (2) every real representation of gQ has a Q-form.
  See Thm. 5.2 for a version of Prop. 2.1 that replaces 2.1(b) with
a quite different hypothesis, due to M. S. Raghunathan. The Q-form
constructed in §6 also satisfies this alternate hypothesis, so this yields
a different proof of Cor. 2.6.

                          3. Preliminaries
  The following is well known (see, for example, [T, Thm. 2.5]).
3.1. Lemma. Let
      • F be a subfield of C,
      • g be a semisimple Lie algebra over F , and
      • VC be a C-representation of g.
If g is F -split, then V has an F -form.
4                              DAVE WITTE

Proof. Let t be a maximal F -split torus of g. Because every repre-
sentation of g is a direct sum of irreducibles, we may assume VC is
irreducible; let λ be the highest weight of VC (with respect to some
ordering of the roots of t). Since λ is a character of the F -split torus t,
we know that λ(tF ) ⊂ F . So there is an F -representation VF of g with
highest weight λ. Hence, VF ⊗F C ∼    = VC , so VF is (isomorphic to) an
F -form of VC .                                                          
  For future reference, let us record the following consequence of this
fact.
3.2. Corollary. Suppose, for some quadratic extension F of Q, that g
is an F -split, semisimple Lie algebra over Q.
    (1) If VF is any irreducible F -representation of gF , then VC is irre-
        ducible.
    (2) If VQ is any irreducible Q-representation of g, then VC is either
        irreducible or the direct sum of two irreducibles.
Proof. (1) The proof of Lem. 3.3(⇐) below shows that this is a conse-
quence of Lem. 3.1. √                                           √
   (2) Write F = Q[ r], for some r ∈ Q. Because VF = VQ + rVQ
(and VQ is an irreducible gQ -module), we know that the gF -module VF
is either irreducible or the direct sum of two irreducibles. Then the
desired conclusion follows from (1).                                
  The following observation must be well known. The direction (⇒)
can be found in [R2, §3].
3.3. Lemma. Suppose G is a connected, semisimple algebraic group
over Q. Every irreducible Q-representation of G remains irreducible
over R if and only if every real representation of G has a Q-form.
Proof. (⇐) Let V be a Q-representation of G, such that VR is reducible.
(We wish to show that V is reducible.) We may write VR = U1 ⊕ U2 ,
for some nontrivial R-representations U1 and U2 . By assumption, there
exist Q-representations V1 and V2 , such that (Vj )R ∼
                                                     = Uj . Then
             VR = U1 ⊕ U2 ∼= (V1 )R ⊕ (V2 )R ∼
                                             = (V1 ⊕ V2 )R .
Thus, V is isomorphic to V1 ⊕ V2 over R. Since both V and V1 ⊕ V2
are defined over Q, this implies that V is isomorphic to V1 ⊕ V2 over Q.
(The g-equivariant maps from VR to (V1 ⊕ V2 )R form a real vector space
that is defined over Q, so the Q-points span.) Thus, V is reducible.
  (⇒) Let V be a real representation of G. To simplify notation (and
because this is the only case we need), let us assume that G is split
                REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                        5

over some imaginary quadratic extension F of Q. Then VC has an F -
form U. Let U|Q be the Q-representation obtained by viewing U as a
vector space over Q.
   Now write U|Q = U1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ur as a direct sum of irreducible Q-
modules. Then
             VC |R = UC |R ∼
                           = (U|Q )R ∼
                                     = (U1 )R ⊕ · · · ⊕ (Ur )R
   Since V is a submodule of VC |R (indeed, VC |R is the direct sum V ⊕iV
of two copies of V ), and, by assumption, each (Uj )R is irreducible,
we conclude that V is isomorphic to (Uj )R , for some j. So (up to
isomorphism) Uj is a Q-form of V .                                      
  We also use the following (special case of a) result of J. Tits [T,
Thms. 7.2(i) and 3.3] that applies to the quasi-split case. In our appli-
cations, F will be a p-adic field Qp (see 2.1(b)).
3.4. Proposition (Tits). Let
     • F be a field of chacteristic zero,
     • G be a connected, reductive algebraic F -group, and
     • (π, V ) be an irreducible F -representation of G.
If G is quasi-split over F , then EndG (V ) is commutative.
Proof. By assumption, G has a Borel subgroup B that is defined over F .
Let v ∈ V be a nonzero vector that is fixed by every element of the
unipotent radical of B, and let F be the algebraic closure of F .
   Schur’s Lemma asserts that EndG (V ) is a division algebra. By
enlarging F , we may assume that F is the center of EndG (V ), so
EndG (VF ) = EndG (V )⊗F F is a simple algebra, which implies that VF is
isotypic: we have VF = W ⊕· · ·⊕W , for some irreducible gF -module W .
This implies that v is a weight vector (that is, an eigenvector for π(B)),
so V is a highest-weight module. Therefore EndG (V ) = F , which is
abelian, as desired.                                                    
   The method of R. Pink and G. Prasad utilizes the following classical
result of number theory. It is obtained by combining the Hasse Prin-
cipal (or local-to-global principle) with the fact that the sum of the
local invariants of a quaternion algebra (or, what is the same thing, of
a quadratic form) is 0 (so, if all but one of them vanish, then they all
must vanish).
3.5. Lemma (cf. [Se, Cor. 3.2.3, p. 43]). Let C be a quaternion division
algebra over Q. If C splits over Qp , for every odd prime p, then C does
not split over R.
6                              DAVE WITTE

3.6. Remark. The exceptional prime 2 can be replaced with any other
prime in Lem. 3.5: if there is a prime p0 , such that G is quasi-split over
the p-adic field Qp , for every prime p 6= p0 , then C does not split over R.
But we have no need for this more general (and somewhat less concise)
version.

               4. The method of Pink and Prasad
Proof of Prop. 2.1. Suppose (π, VQ ) is an irreducible representation
of G over Q. Let
                              C = EndG (VQ )
be the centralizer of π(GQ ) in EndQ (VQ ). Then Schur’s Lemma tells us
that C is a division algebra over Q.
   Because G splits over the quadratic extension F , we know that VC
is either irreducible or the sum of two irreducibles (see 3.2(2)).
Case 1. Assume VC is irreducible. Then VR is obviously irreducible.
Case 2. Assume VC is the direct sum of two irreducibles that are not
isomorphic. From the assumption of this case, and the fact that G splits
over F , we know that VF is the direct sum of two irreducibles that are
not isomorphic. √                        = F ⊕ F , so C ⊗Q F ∼
                   Therefore, EndG (VF ) ∼                   = F ⊕ F.
                                         +
   Write F = Q[ −r], for some r ∈ Q .
       • Because F ⊕F is commutative, we know that C is commutative,
         so C is a field.
       • Because dimF (F ⊕ F√) = 2, we know that dimQ C = 2.
       • Because C⊗Q F = C[ −r] is not a field, we know that C contains
         a root of x2 + r.
We conclude that C ∼    = F.
   Therefore
                    EndG (VR ) ∼
                               = C ⊗Q R ∼= F ⊗Q R ∼=C
is a field. So VR is irreducible.
Case 3. Assume VC is the direct sum of two irreducibles that are iso-
morphic. In this case, we know that EndG (VC ) ∼     = Mat2×2 (C) is 4-
                                       ∼
dimensional over C. Since EndG (VC ) = C ⊗Q C, we conclude that C is
4-dimensional over Q. Thus, C is a quaternion algebra over Q.
   For every odd prime p, Prop. 3.4 (and the fact that C ⊗Q Qp is not
commutative) implies that VQp is reducible, so C ⊗Q Qp = EndG (VQp )
is not a division algebra. In other words, C splits over Qp .
   Now, Lem. 3.5 asserts that C does not split over R. This means
that EndG (VR ) ∼= C ⊗Q R is a division algebra. We conclude that VR is
irreducible, as desired.                                             

4.1. Remark. From the proof (and Rem. 3.6), it is clear that the
exceptional prime 2 can be replaced with any other prime in Condi-
tion 2.1(b): it suffices to assume that there is a prime p0 , such that G
is quasi-split over the p-adic field Qp , for every prime p 6= p0 . The case
p0 = 2 is all we need for our proof of Cor. 2.6.

                5. Reducing to the compact case
5.1. Definition. Suppose G is a connected, reductive algebraic Q-
group. Let
     • S be a maximal Q-split torus of G;
     • C = CG (S) be the centralizer of S;
     • M ′ be the (unique) maximal connected, semisimple subgroup
        of the reductive group C;
     • T be a maximal Q-torus of M ′ ;
     • Φ+ be the positive roots of (m′C , tC ) (with respect to some or-
        dering); and
     • Φ− be the set of negative roots.
  We call M ′ the semisimple anisotropic kernel of G.
  We say that the longest element of the Weyl group of the anisotropic
kernel of G is realized over Q if there is some w ∈ NM ′ (T )Q , such that
                              w(Φ+ ) = Φ− .
Here, as usual, the normalizer NM ′ (T ) acts on t∗ by
                          w(λ)(t) = λ(w −1tw).
It is important to notice (from the subscripts in NM ′ (T )Q ) that w is
required to be in the semisimple group M ′ , and that w is required to
be a Q-element.
5.2. Theorem. Suppose G is a connected, reductive algebraic Q-group.
If
    (a) G is split over some imaginary quadratic extension F of Q,
    (b) Q-rank G = R-rank G, and
    (c) the longest element of the Weyl group of the anisotropic kernel
        of G is realized over Q,
then each irreducible Q-representation of G remains irreducible over R.
  M. S. Raghunathan [R2, §3] proved Thm. 5.2 in the special case
where
     • G is semisimple, and
     • R-rank G = 0 (in other words, G is compact).
The following result shows that the general case follows from this.
8                              DAVE WITTE

5.3. Proposition. Suppose G is a connected, reductive algebraic group
over Q, and let M ′ be the semisimple anisotropic kernel of G. If
     • G is split over some imaginary quadratic extension F of Q;
     • Q-rank G = R-rank G; and
     • every irreducible Q-representation of M ′ remains irreducible
       over R,
then every irreducible Q-representation of G remains irreducible over R.

5.4. Remark. There is no need to assume that the quadratic exten-
sion F is imaginary in (5.2) or (5.3): if F is real, then the hypotheses
imply that G is Q-split, so Lem. 3.1 applies.

   Before proving the proposition, let us state a simple lemma, which
reduces the construction of Q-forms of representations of G to the
same problem for certain representations of a minimal parabolic P . It
is similar to the usual construction of highest weight modules.

5.5. Lemma. Let
     • g be a semisimple Lie algebra over Q;
     • t be a maximal Q-split torus of g;
     • ΦQ be the system of Q-roots of (g, t);
     • p be a minimal parabolic Q-subalgebra of g that contains t;
     • V be an irreducible, real g-module;
     • λ : t → Q be the highest weight of V , with respect to the ordering
       of ΦQ determined by the parabolic p; and
     • U be a p-invariant Q-form of the weight space V λ .
Then the representation V has a Q-form.
                                                     e be the Q-span
Proof. Let ∆Q be the base of ΦQ determined by p. Let U
of
              { y1y2 · · · yk w | w ∈ U, αj ∈ ∆Q , yj ∈ g−αj }.


Step 1. U e is g-invariant. From the definition of U,
                                                    e it is obvious that
       e] ⊂ U
[g−α , U     e for all α ∈ ∆Q . Also, because both the centralizer cg(t)
and the root space gα are contained in p, it is not difficult to see (by

induction on k) that [cg(t), U]     e and [gα , U]
                                                e ⊂U  e , for all α ∈ ∆Q .
Since
                          S
                   cg(t) ∪ α∈∆Q (gα ∪ g−α ) generates g,

                 e is g-invariant.
we conclude that U
        e spans V over R. The R-span of U
Step 2. U                                   e is a submodule of V . so
the desired conclusion follows from the fact that V is irreducible.
Step 3. If a1 , . . . , ar are real numbers that are linearly independent

over Q, and w1 , . . . , wr are nonzero elements of U  e , then r aj wj 6= 0.

Suppose rj=1 aj wj = 0. (This will lead to a contradiction.)
  Since y1 y2 · · · yk w ∈ V λ−α1 −···−αk , we see that

(5.6)                                  e ∩Vλ = U
                                       U
and
                                          M

                                          µ∈t∗

Because of (5.7), we may assume there is some weight µ, such that
wj ∈ V µ for all j. (Project to some V µ , and delete the wj ’s whose
projection is 0.)
   Because V is irreducible, and λ is the highest weight, there exist
x1 , . . . , xk ∈ ∪α∈∆Q gα , such that x1 · · · xk w1 is a nonzero element of V λ .
From (5.7), we see that x1 · · · xk wj ∈ V λ for every j. Hence, (5.6)
implies that x1 · · · xk wj ∈ U for all j. Since
         r
         X                                          r
                                                    X
               aj (x1 · · · xk wj ) = x1 · · · xk         aj wj = x1 · · · xk · 0 = 0,
         j=1                                        j=1

and U is a Q-form of V λ , this implies that x1 · · · xk wj = 0 for every j.
This contradicts the choice of x1 , . . . , xk .
Step 4. Completion of proof. From Steps 2 and 3, we see that the
natural scalar-multiplication map R ⊗Q U e → V is a bijection. So U
                                                                  e is
a Q-form of the vector space V . By combining this with Step 1, we
conclude that Ue is a Q-form of the representation.                 

Proof of Prop. 5.3. We consider two cases.
Case 1. Assume that the semisimple part of GR is compact. We may
write G = M ′ AT , where
        • M ′ is connected and semisimple (so, by assumption, MR′ is com-
          pact);
        • A is a Q-split torus; and
        • T is a torus that is anisotropic over Q.
10                             DAVE WITTE

Let V be an irreducible Q-representation of G. Since A, being a Q-
split, central torus, acts by scalars, we know that V is an irreducible
Q-representation of M ′ T .
Subcase 1.1. Assume T acts trivially on V . Then V is an irreducible Q-
representation of M ′ , so, by assumption, it remains irreducible over R.
Subcase 1.2. Assume T acts nontrivially on V . Because TF is an F -
split, central torus, its Lie algebra defines an action of F on V that cen-
tralizes M ′ . Thus, we may think of V as an irreducible F -representation
of M ′ . Let us say VQ = WF ; then VR = WC . Because M ′ is F -split, we
know that WC is irreducible (see 3.2(1)).
   Because Q-rank T = 0 and Q-rank G = R-rank G, we see that
R-rank T = 0, which means TR is compact, so the Lie algebra of T
acts by purely imaginary scalars on WC . Thus, any M ′ T -invariant R-
submodule of VR is an M ′ -invariant C-submodule of WC . Hence, the
conclusion of the preceding paragraph implies that VR is irreducible.
Case 2. The general case. Given a representation V of G over R, we
wish to show that V has a Q-form (see Lem. 3.3). Because repre-
sentations of G are completely reducible, we may assume that V is
irreducible.
   Let P be a minimal parabolic Q-subgroup of G, let T be a maximal
Q-split torus of P , and λ be the highest weight of V (with respect to T
and P ).
   Now V λ is CG (T )-invariant, so, from Case 1, we know that the vector
space V λ has a Q-form U that is CG (T )Q -invariant. Then, since the
unipotent radical of P annihilates V λ , we know that U is PQ -invariant.
So Lem. 5.5 implies that V has a Q-form.                               

               6. Construction of a good Q-form
  In this section, we provide an explicit construction of a Q-form of G
that satisfies the hypotheses of Prop. 2.1 and Thm. 5.2.
6.1. Proposition. If G is a connected, simply connected, semisimple
algebraic R-group, then G has a Q-form, such that
    (1) G is split over Q(i),
    (2) G is quasi-split over the p-adic field Qp , for every odd prime p,
    (3) Q-rank G = R-rank G, and
    (4) every element of the Weyl group of the anisotropic kernel of G
        is defined over Q.
   The argument is a straightforward adaptation of A. Borel’s [B] clas-
sical proof of the existence of an anisotropic Q-form.
                REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                       11

  Actually, like Borel, we do not directly construct GQ itself, but only
the Lie algebra gQ , so, to avoid problems in passing from the Lie algebra
to the group, we need to make some assumption on the fundamental
group of G. (It needs to be a Q-subgroup of the universal cover G.)    e
Therefore, the statement of Prop. 6.1 requires G to be simply con-
nected. Alternatively, one could require G to be adjoint, instead of
simply connected, but the situation is not obvious for some intermedi-
ate groups that are neither adjoint nor simply connected.
6.2. Remark. As a complement to our explicit construction, it might
be possible to use theorems of Galois cohomology to give a more ele-
gant proof of Prop. 2.4. In this vein, G. Prasad (see [O, Prop. 6.4])
gave a very short proof of the existence of a Q-form satisfying 6.1(1)
and 6.1(3); perhaps a clever argument can yield 6.1(2) and/or 6.1(4),
as well, but they do not seem to be obvious.
  Let us set up the usual notation.
6.3. Notation.
     • g is a real semisimple Lie algebra;
     • κ(·, ·) is the Killing form on g;
     • h is a maximal torus (i.e., a Cartan subalgebra) of g;
     • Φ is the set of roots of (gC , hC );
     • hα is the unique element of hC , such that α(t) = κ(t, hα ) for all
        t ∈ hC (for each α ∈ Φ);
     • h∗α = 2hα /κ(hα , hα ) (for each α ∈ Φ);
     • (gC )α is the root space corresponding to α ∈ Φ;
     • θ is a Cartan involution of g, such that θ(h) = h (we also use
        θ to denote the extension to a C-linear automorphism of gC );
     • g = k + p is the Cartan decomposition of g corresponding to θ
        (i.e., k and p are the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of θ, respectively).
Because θ(h) = h, we see that θ induces a permutation of Φ: we have
θ (gC )α = (gC )θ(α) .
   The following lemma is a slight modification of a result of Borel [B,
§3.2 and Lem. 3.5] that extends work of Chevalley and Weyl. (See
[B, p. 116 and footnote on p. 117] for some historical remarks.) We
follow Borel’s proof almost verbatim. However, Borel assumed that the
Cartan subalgebra h contains a maximal R-anisotropic torus of g, and,
using this assumption, he obtained a stronger version of (3): θ(xα ) =
±xθ(α) .
6.4. Lemma (Borel, Chevalley, Gantmacher, Weyl). Assume the no-
tation of (6.3).

  There is a function Φ → g : α 7→ xα , such that, for α, β ∈ Φ, we
have
   (1) xα ∈ gα ; 
                    Nα,β xα+β if α + β ∈ Φ,
                    

                                             / Φ,
       where
(6.5)                    Nα,β = N−α,−β = ±(pα,β + 1)
         and pα,β ≥ 0 is the greatest integer such that α − pα,β β ∈ Φ;
     (3) θ(xα ) ∈ {±xθ(α) , ±ixθ(α) }; and

                   α∈Φ            α∈Φ

Proof ([B, §3.2–§3.5] or [R1, Chap. 14]). The famous Chevalley basis
[C] satisfies (1) and (2).
Step 1. We may assume (4) holds. Recall that all of the maximal
compact subgroups of any connected Lie group are conjugate to each
other, and that all of the maximal toruses of any connected, compact
Lie group are conjugate to each other. Thus, since the LHS and RHS of
(4) arePmaximal compact subalgebras of gC that contain the maximal
torus α∈ΦP  iRhα , they are conjugate, via an automorphism of gC that
normalizes α∈Φ iRhα . Hence, by replacing {xα }α∈Φ with a conjugate,
we may assume (4) holds.
Step 2. For each α ∈ Φ, define cα ∈ C by θ(xα ) = cα xθ(α) ; then
                                  1
(6.6)                    c−α =      = cθ(α) for all α ∈ Φ
                                 cα
and
(6.7)        cα cβ = ±cα+β for all α, β ∈ Φ, such that α + β ∈ Φ.
Note that
          −cα c−α h∗θ(α) = [cα xθ(α) , c−α x−θ(α) ]
                          = [θ(xα ), θ(x−α )] = θ[xα , x−α ] = −θ(h∗α ).
Because θ(h∗α ) = h∗θ(α) (since θ is an automorphism that fixes h), this
implies that cα c−α = 1, which establishes part of (6.6). For the other
part, we use the fact that θ2 = Id to calculate
                   xα = θ2 (xα ) = cα θ(xθ(α) ) = cα cθ(α) xα .
                REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                       13

 To establish (6.7), note that pθ(α),θ(β) = pα,β (because θ is an auto-
morphism), so Nθ(α),θ(β) = ±Nα,β . Now use the fact that
                       [θ(xα ), θ(xβ )] = θ[xα , xβ ].

Step 3. We may assume (3) holds. Let ∆ be a basis of Φ (with respect
to some order). Then ∆ is a basis of the dual space h∗ , so there is some
h ∈ hC , such that eα(h) = cα , for every α ∈ ∆. Then, from (6.7), we see,
by induction on the length of α, that eα(h) = ±cα , for every α ∈ Φ+ .
Because c−α = 1/cα , then we have eα(h) = ±cα , for every α ∈ Φ.
  For each α ∈ Φ, let x′α = e−α(h)/2 xα . Then it is easy to see that (1)
and (2) hold with x′α in the place of xα .
  Because θ(k + ip) = k + ip, we see from (4) that c−α = cα . Then
1/cα = c−α = cα , so |cα | = 1. Therefore, α(h) is pure imaginary for
every α ∈ ∆. By linearity, then α(h) is pure imaginary for every α ∈ Φ,
so e−α(h)/2 = eα(h)/2 , for every α ∈ Φ. Thus, (4) holds with x′α in the
place of xα .
  For any α ∈ Φ, we have
                    θ(x′α ) = e−α(h)/2 θ(xα )
                                                  
                          = (±cα )−1/2 cα xθ(α)
                                                          
                          = (±cα )1/2 eθ(α)(h)/2 x′θ(α)
                          = (±cα )1/2 (±cθ(α) )1/2 x′θ(α)
                          = (±cα )1/2 (±cα )−1/2 x′θ(α)
                          = (±1)1/2 x′θ(α) .
Thus, (3) holds with x′α in the place of xα .                           
  Prop. 6.1 is obtained quite easily from this lemma. Most of the
argument we give is based on [B] or [R1, Chap. 14]. However, Steps 6
and 7 are from [R2, §2], and Steps 8 and 9 are based on suggestions of
G. Prasad (personal communication).
Proof   of Prop. 6.1. We begin by establishing notation.
    •   Let g be the Lie algebra of G.
    •   Choose a maximal torus h of g, such that R-rank h = R-rank g.
    •   Assume the notation of (6.3).
    •   Let t = h ∩ p (so t is a maximal R-split torus of g).
    •   Let {xα }α∈Φ be as in Lem. 6.4.
    •   Let gQ(i) be the Q(i)-span of {h∗α , xα }α∈Φ in gC = g ⊗R C.
    •   Let hQ(i) = hC ∩ gQ(i) be the Q(i)-span of {h∗α }α∈Φ in gC .
    •   Let gQ = gQ(i) ∩ g.
14                             DAVE WITTE

We will show that gQ is a Q-form of g, and that the corresponding
Q-form GQ of G satisfies all the hypotheses of Prop. 6.1.
Step 1. gQ(i) is a split Q(i)-form of gC , with hQ(i) being a Q(i)-split
maximal torus. It is clear that gQ(i) is a Q(i)-form of gC (because it
is the Q(i)-span of a basis, and is closed under brackets). It is split
because it contains a Chevalley basis of gC , and hQ(i) is the maximal
split torus corresponding to this basis.
Step 2. Each of k and p is the R-span of its intersection with gQ . Be-
cause each of these subspaces is contained in g, it suffices to prove the
conclusion with gQ replaced by gQ(i) .
   Let UQ = (k + ip) ∩ gQ(i). Then UQ is a Q-subspace of k + ip. Indeed,
we see, from 6.4(4), that UQ is a Q-form of the real vector space k + ip.
   Now k + ip and gQ(i) are θ-invariant (for the latter, see 6.4(3)). So
UQ is θ-invariant. This means that, with respect to the Q-form UQ ,
the linear transformation θ|k+ip is defined over Q. Since the eigenval-
ues (±1) are rational, we conclude that the eigenspaces are spanned
(over R) by the rational vectors, that is by elements of UQ . Concretely,
this means that the R-span of k ∩ UQ is k, and the R-span of ip ∩ UQ
is ip. The first is exactly what we want to know about k. Multiplying
by i transforms the second into exactly what we want to know about p.
Step 3. gQ is a Q-form of g. Because g and gQ(i) are closed under
brackets, it is clear that gQ is a subalgebra of g. We just need to show
that its R-span is all of g.
  From Step 2, we know that the R-span of gQ contains both k and p.
Therefore, it contains k + p = g.
Step 4. gQ splits over Q(i). We already pointed out in Step 1 that gQ(i)
is split.
Step 5. Q-rank gQ = R-rank g. Because t = h ∩ p is a maximal R-split
torus of g, it suffices to show that t is (defined over Q and) Q-split.
Substep 5.1. t is defined over Q. From Step 3, we see that gQ(i) = gQ +
igQ , so, for any (real) subspace X of g, we have XC ∩ gQ(i) = (X ∩ gQ )C .
Thus, if XC is the R-span of its intersection with gQ(i) , then X is the
R-span of its intersection with gQ , i.e., X is defined over Q.
   It is clear, from the definition of gQ(i) , that hC is the R-span of
its intersection with gQ(i) . Hence, from the preceding paragraph, we
conclude that h is defined over Q. From Step 2, we know that p is also
defined over Q. Hence, the intersection t = h ∩ p is defined over Q.
Substep 5.2. t is is Q-split. Let T be the Q-torus of G corresponding
to t. We know that T splits over R, so χ(TR ) ⊂ R, for every character χ
                 REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                      15

of T . Because t ⊂ h, and h splits over Q(i) (see Step 1), we know that
χ(TQ ) ⊂ Q(i), for every character χ of T . So χ(TQ ) ⊂ R ∩ Q(i) = Q,
for every character χ of T ; hence, T is Q-split.
Step 6. For each α ∈ Φ, let
                      g±α = h(gC )α , (gC )−α i ∩ g.
                       
If α(t) = 0, then g±α Q ∼ = su(2)Q (for the usual Q-form on SU(2)).
Because t is a maximal R-split torus, the assumption on α implies that
(gC )α ⊂ kC (and the same for −α). So, using 6.4(4), we see that
         h(gC )α , (gC )−α i ∩ g = h(gC )α , (gC )−α i ∩ k
                                = iRh∗α + { zxα + zx−α | z ∈ C }.
Therefore
                              
       h(gC )α , (gC )−α i ∩ g Q = iQh∗α + { zxα + zx−α | z ∈ Q(i) }
                                 ∼
                                 = su(2)Q .

Step 7. Every element of the Weyl group of the anisotropic kernel of G
is realized over Q. The Weyl element of SU(2) is realized by the rational
matrix                               
                                 0 1
                                        .
                                −1 0
So Step 6 implies that all of the root reflections of the anisotropic
kernel can be realized over Q. These reflections generate the entire
Weyl group.
Step 8. For any odd prime p, and any α ∈ Φ, such that α(t) = 0,
the Lie algebra g±α is Qp -split. The quadratic form x21 + x22 + x23 is
isotropic over Qp (see, for example, [BS, Cor. 1.6.2, p. 50]), so so(3) is
                         = su(2)Qp and su(2)Qp ∼
Qp -split. Since so(3)Qp ∼                      = (g±α )Qp (see Step 6),
we conclude that g±α is Qp -split.
Step 9. gQp is quasi-split, for every odd prime p. Let Ψ be a maximal
set of pairwise orthogonal roots in { α ∈ Φ | α(t) = 0 }. For each α ∈ Ψ,
we know, from Step 8, that (g±α )Qp contains a nontrivial Qp -split torus
sα ; let
                                        X
                            sQp = tQp +     sα .
                                            α∈Ψ
From the maximality of Ψ, we know that the centralizer of the torus
                                  X

tori of the Lie algebra             X

so they are conjugate over the algebraic closure of Qp . Therefore, the
centralizer of s is also a (maximal) torus of gQp . Because s is Qp -split,
this implies that gQp is quasi-split.                                    

              7. Which Q-forms are R-universal?
7.1. Definition. Let us say that a Lie algebra gQ over Q is universal
for real representations (or simply R-universal, for short) if every real
representation of gQ has a Q-form.
  We have shown that every semisimple real Lie algebra has an R-
universal Q-form (see 2.6). Furthermore, our construction yields an
example that is Q(i)-split (see 6.1(1)). In fact, results of J. Tits [T]
show it is often the case that every Q(i)-split Q-form of g is R-universal.
7.2. Proposition. Let g be a compact, simple Lie algebra over R. If
g has a Q-form that splits over some quadratic extension of Q, but is
not R-universal, then either
                   g∼= su(n), for some even n ≥ 4,
or
               g∼
                = so(n), for some n 6≡ 3, 5      (mod 8).
   In this section, we show that the converse is true (cf. 7.4).
   Using Tits’ approach, it should be possible to give an explicit list
of the Q-forms of su(n) and so(n) that are not R-universal (except,
perhaps, those that are triality forms of type 3 D4 or 6 D4 ). The author
intends to attack this project in a future paper.
Proof of Prop. 7.2. Let F be a quadratic extension of Q, and sup-
pose gQ is a Q-form of g that splits over F , but is not R-universal. (We
remark that F must be an imaginary extension, because gR = g is com-
pact, not split.) There is an irreducible Q-representation V of gQ , such
that V is reducible over R (see 3.3). Thus, we may write VR = W ⊕ X
(with W and X nontrivial). From Cor. 3.2(2), we see that WC and XC
are irreducible.
   Let λ be the highest weight of WC , and let w be the longest element
of the Weyl group of g. Because WC is irreducible, and has an R-form
(namely, W ), it must be the case that
      • w(λ) = −λ, and
                  REAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVE Q-FORMS                           17

      • when λ is expressed as a linear combination of simple roots, the
         sum of the coefficients is an integer
(see [T, Prop. 6.1 and following comments]). Because WC has no Q-
form (any such Q-form would be isomorphic to a proper submodule
of V ), it must be the case that
      • λ is not an integral linear combination of roots
(see [T, Thm. 3.3]). Now Lem. 7.3 below yields the desired conclusion.
                                                                      
  The following observation is obtained by inspection of a list of the
fundamental dominant weights of the complex simple Lie algebras of
each type Aℓ , Bℓ , Cℓ , Dℓ , E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2 . Such a list appears in [H,
Table 1, p. 69].
7.3. Lemma. Suppose g is a simple Lie algebra over C, and let w be the
longest element of the Weyl group of g. There is a dominant weight λ
of g, such that
    (1) w(λ) = −λ, and
    (2) when λ is expressed as a linear combination of simple roots, the
        sum of the coefficients is an integer, and
    (3) λ is not an integral linear combination of roots
if and only if either
    (a) g is of type Aℓ , with ℓ odd (and ℓ ≥ 3), or
    (b) g is of type Bℓ , with ℓ ≡ 3 or 4 (mod 4) (and ℓ ≥ 3), or
    (c) g is of type Dℓ (and ℓ ≥ 3).
   Combining Lem. 7.3 with the following result establishes the converse
of Prop. 7.2.
7.4. Proposition. Suppose
     • G is a compact, real, semisimple Lie group,
     • g is the Lie algebra of G;
     • t is a maximal torus of g;
     • Φ is the root system of g (with respect to t)
     • w ∈ G is a representative of the longest element of the Weyl
       group of G;
     • V is an irreducible C-representation of G; and
     • λ is the highest weight of V .
If
     • w(λ) = −λ;
     • when λ is expressed as a linear combination of simple roots, the
       sum of the coefficients is an integer; and
18                             DAVE WITTE

      • λ ∈/ hΦi (that is, λ is not an integral linear combination of
        roots);
then there exist
     (1) a real form VR of V ; and
     (2) a Q-form g′Q of g;
such that
     (a) g′Q splits over Q(i); and
     (b) VR does not have a Q-form (with respect to g′Q ).
Proof. (1) Since w(λ) = −λ, we see that the lowest weight of V is −λ.
Since the dual of V is the irreducible g-module whose lowest weight
is −λ, we conclude that V is self-dual. That is, V is isomorphic to its
dual.
   Because g is compact, there is a g-invariant Hermitian form on V ,
so V is conjugate-isomorphic to its dual. Combining this with the
conclusion of preceding paragraph, we conclude that V is conjugate-
isomorphic to itself. That is, V is isomorphic to its conjugate. There-
fore V ⊗R C ∼= V ⊕ V is the direct sum of two isomorphic irreducibles.
   Because the sum of the coefficients of λ is an integer, V has a real
form VR (see 7.6). (We remark that any two real forms of V are iso-
morphic, so it does not matter which one is chosen.)
  (2a) Let ∆ be a base of Φ. The difference of the highest weight and
the lowest weight is a sum of roots, so, because the highest weight is λ
and the lowest weight is −λ, we may write
                                     r
                                     X
                              2λ =         aδ δ,
                                     δ∈∆

with each aδ ∈ Z. Because λ ∈/ hΦi, there must be some τ ∈ ∆, such
that aτ is odd.
  Let
                        {hδ }δ∈∆ ∪ {xα }α∈Φ
be the usual Chevalley basis of gC , so that
                 M           M

                    δ∈∆        α∈Φ

For each α ∈ Φ, we may write
                                  X
                             α=         cδ (α) δ,

with each cδ (α) ∈ Z. In particular, we have defined a function cτ : Φ →
Z. Now let
                 M            M√                               
        g′Q(i) =    Q(i)hδ ⊕      ( 3)cτ (α) Q(i)xα + Q(i)x−α

and
           g′Q = g′Q(i) ∩ g
                 M            M√                              	
               =       iQhδ ⊕  ( 3)cτ (α) zxα + zx−α | z ∈ Q(i) .
                δ∈∆        α∈Φ

  Because
                      √               √            √
                 Q(i)( 3)−r = 3r Q(i)( 3)−r = Q(i)( 3)r ,
we see that g′Q(i) is the Q(i)-span of the Chevalley basis
                                 n √              o
                                        cτ (α)
                      {hδ }δ∈∆ ∪ ( 3)          xα   ,
                                                    α∈Φ

sog′Q(i)is a split Q(i)-form of gC . From this (and because it is obvious
that the R-span of g′Q is all of g), it follows that g′Q is a Q-form of g,
such that g′Q splits over Q(i).
   (2b) Suppose VR has a g′Q -invariant Q-form VQ′ . (This will lead to a
contradiction.) Then there is a g′Q -equivariant conjugate-linear involu-
tion σ ′ : VQ(i)
            ′       ′
                 → VQ(i) .
                                                                √
   Let gQ be the standard Q-form of g (obtained by replacing 3 with 1
in the above construction). We know (from Cor. 2.3) that VR has a
gQ -invariant Q-form VQ . Let σ : VQ(i) → VQ(i) be the corresponding
gQ -equivariant conjugate-linear involution.
   Because all highest-weight vectors of V are scalar multiples of each
other, there is no harm in assuming that (VQ(i)′
                                                 )λ ∩ VQ(i)
                                                       λ
                                                            6= 0. (Simply
replace VQ(i) with kVQ(i) , for some k ∈ C.) Then, because these are
one-dimensional vector spaces over Q(i), we must have
                                ′
                              (VQ(i) )λ = VQ(i)
                                           λ
                                                .
   Then, by induction on the length of α, it is easy to see that if α is any
integral combination of elements of ∆, with non-negative coefficients,
then                                √
                        ′
                     (VQ(i) )λ−α = ( 3)cτ (α) VQ(i)

                                                    .
In particular, because cτ (2λ) is odd (this was how τ was chosen), we
know that                             √ −λ
                             ′

fact that σ ′ is an involution.                                     
7.5. Example. The direct sum of R-universal Lie algebras need not
be R-universal. For example, let g1 = so(5) and g2 = so(11). For
j = 1, 2, the Lie algebra (gj )C has a (fundamental) dominant weight
λj , such that, when λj is expressed as a linear combination of simple
roots, the sum of the coefficients is a half-integer. Then the weight
λ1 ⊗ λ2 of g1 ⊕ g2 satisfies the hypotheses of Prop. 7.4, so g1 ⊕ g2 has a
Q-form that is not R-universal. However, any Q-form of g1 ⊕ g2 must
be the direct sum of Q-forms of the factors and those, by Prop. 7.2,
are R-universal.
   The following useful observations are well known. (4a ⇔ 4b) follows
from Schur’s Lemma. (4b ⇔ 4c) follows from [St, Lem. 79(b), p. 226].
(4b ⇔ 4d) follows from [T, Prop. 6.1]. (4a ⇔ 4c) is implicit in the
proof on pp. 137–138 of [R2].
7.6. Lemma. Suppose
      • G is a compact, semisimple, real Lie group,
      • V is an irreducible, self-dual, real representation of G,
      • λ is the highest weight of V , and
      • w ∈ G is a representative of the longest element of the Weyl
        group of G.
Then:
    (1) We have EndG (V ) ∼ = R or H.
    (2) We have w(λ) = −λ and λ(w 2 ) = ±1.
    (3) We may write λ as a linear combination of the fundamental
        dominent weights of G, and the sum s of the coefficients in this
        linear combination is either an integer or a half-integer.

           (b)    EndG (V ) ∼= R;
            (c)   λ(w 2 ) = 1;
           (d)    the sum s is an integer.
