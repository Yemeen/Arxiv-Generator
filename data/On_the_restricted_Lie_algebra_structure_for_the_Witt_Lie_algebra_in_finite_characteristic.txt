                                                  1. Introduction. Let p be a prime, F be a field of characteristic p, and F be the
                                             algebraic closure of F. Let A = F[x]/(xp − 1). Notice that F[x]/(xp − 1) ∼       = F[x]/(xp ), an
                                                                                                                                 d p
                                             isomorphism may be established be the formula x ↔ x − 1. Notice also that              (x − 1) ⊂
                                                                                                                                dx
                                                            d p                                     d
                                             (xp − 1) and     (x ) ⊂ (xp ), hence, the operator        is also defined in A; the isomorphism
                                                           dx                                      dx
                                                                                 d                                           d
                                             described above commutes with         . Below, we abbreviate the notation          to ∂.
                                                                                dx                                          dx
                                                  The Lie algebra W = Der A is called the Witt algebra. It consists of “vector fields”
                                             f ∂, f ∈ A. In particular, dimF W = dimF A = p.
                                                  As any Lie algebra of derivations of a commutative algebra over F, W has a canonical
                                             structure of a restricted Lie algebra. Recall that a restricted Lie algebra is a Lie algebra
                                             over F with an additional unary (in general, non-linear) operation g 7→ g [p] satisfying the
                                             conditions
                                                                      (λg)[p] = λp g [p] (λ ∈ F), ad(g [p] ) = (ad g)p ,
                                                                                                                   p−1
                                                                                                                   X
                                                                                    [p]        [p]       [p]
                                                                          (g + h)         =g         +h        +         si (g, h)
                                                                                                                   i=1

                                             where si (g, h) is the coefficient of λi−1 in (ad(λg + h))p−1 (h) times i−1 modulo p; in
                                             particular, [g [p], g] = 0 for any g (see details in [1]). In Der A, g [p] = g p (obviously, if
                                             g ∈ Der A, then g p = g ◦ . . . ◦ g ∈ Der A.)
                                                  Although the operation g 7→ g [p] does not need to be linear, it is fully determined by
                                             its values on any basis of the Lie algebra. In particular, in W ,

                                                                  (x∂)[p] = x∂, (xk ∂)[p] = 0 for k = 0, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1

                                             (these formulas hold whether A is regarded as F[x]/(xp − 1) or F[x]/(xp ); the same is true
                                             for Theorem 1 below). We will give, however, a more detailed description of the operation
                                             g 7→ g [p] in W .
                                                 Theorem 1. (a) For any f ∈ A, (f ∂)[p] = C(f )f ∂, where C(f ) is a constant
                                             (depending on f ).
                                                 (b) For any f ∈ A, ∂(f ∂(. . . (f ∂f ) . . .)) with p − 1 ∂’s (and p − 1 f ’s) is a constant,
                                             and this constant is equal to C(f ).
                                                 (c) For any f ∈ A, ∂ p−1 (f p−1 ) is a constant, and this constant is equal to −C(f ).
                                                 Since Parts (a) and (b) of Theorem 1 are very simple (see Section 2), it is Part (c), or
                                             rather the equivalence between (b) and (c), that is the main result of this paper. Moreover,

                                                                                                     1
this result is majorated by three (actually equivalent) combinatorial theorems. We state
these theorems in Section 3 and prove them in Section 4.
      2. Proof of Parts (a) and (b) of Theorem 1. The Lie algebra W has rank
one, in the sense that there exists a non-empty Zariski open subset U ⊂ W such that if
g ∈ U and [h, g] = 0, then h ∈ Fg. Since [g [p] , g] = 0, g [p] ∈ Fg, at least for g ∈ U . But
since g 7→ g [p] is an algebraic map, this implies that g [p] ∈ Fg for all g ∈ W . (Strictly
speaking, for this purpose F should be infinite, but, if necessary, we can extend F to F
and take U in the extended W .) This proves (a): (f ∂)[p] = C(f )f ∂ for some algebraic
function C: W → F. To prove (b), apply the both sides of this equality to x ∈ A. We have:
f ∂(f ∂(. . . (f ∂f ) . . .)) = C(f )f , which shows that ∂(f ∂(. . . (f ∂f ) . . .)) = C(f ), at least if
f ∈ A is not a zero divisor. Hence, the last equality holds for any f in a non-empty Zariski
open subset of A (for example, if f˜ ∈ F[x] has a non-zero constant term, then the image
of f˜ under the projection F[x] → F[x]/(xp ) = A is not a zero divisor in A). Since the set
of those f ∈ A for which our equality does not hold is also open, it should be empty: any
two non-empty Zariski open subsets of an affine space over an infinite field overlap, and F̄,
if not F itself, is infinite. Thus, the equality holds for all f ∈ A, which is the statement of
(b).
     3. Three combinatorial theorems. In this section, we state Theorems 2,3, and 4,
and show that each of them implies Theorem 1 (c). In addition to that, Theorems 2 and
3 are equivalent to each other and imply Theorem 4.
     First, we consider arbitrary finite words in a two-letter alphabet (∂, f ) ending with f .
(We do not specify, what f and ∂ are; for example, f may be a C ∞ function in one variable
and ∂ the derivative.) This word may be regarded as an integral linear combination of
differential monomials f (k1 ) . . . f (km ) . For example, ∂f ∂∂f = (f f ′′ )′ = f ′ f ′′ + f f ′′′ .
     Theorem 2. For any prime p,

                                      (∂f )p−1 ≡ −∂ p−1 f p−1 mod p.

     Example:

         (∂f )4 = ∂f ∂f ∂f ∂f = (f ′ )4 + 11f (f ′ )2 f ′′ + 4f 2 (f ′′ )2 + 7f 2 f ′ f ′′′ + f 3 f (4) ,
          ∂ 4 f 4 = 24(f ′ )4 + 144f (f ′ )2 f ′′ + 36f 2 (f ′′ )2 + 48f 2 f ′ f ′′′ + 4f 3 f (4) .

We see that (∂f )4 ≡ −∂ 4 f 4 mod 5, as stated in Theorem.
                                                                                                             d
     Theorem 2 (with Theorems 1(a), (b)) implies Theorem 1(c): take f ∈ F[x], ∂ =                              ,
                                                                                                            dx
and project the equality (∂f )p−1 = −∂ p−1 f p−1 (which holds if char F = p) onto A.
     Theorem 2 may be reformulated as a congruence of symmetric polynomials, in the
following way.
     Theorem 3. In Z[t1 , . . . , tp−1 ],
       X
               tσ(1) (tσ(1) + tσ(2) ) . . . (tσ(1) + . . . + tσ(p−1) ) ≡ (t1 + . . . + tp−1 )p−1 mod p,
      σ∈Sp−1


                                                         2
where p, as usual, is a prime.
       (No minus sign is this congruence, it is not a misprint!)
       Obviously, if
                                                                    X                               k
                       t1 (t1 + t2 ) . . . (t1 + . . . + tp−1 ) =       nk1 ...kp−1 tk11 . . . tp−1
                                                                                                 p−1
                                                                                                     ,

then                                                     X                   (k1 )        (k     )

                                                                                              p−1
                                                                                                  .

       Similarly, if
                                                           X                               k

                                                                                         p−1
                                                                                             ,

then                                                   X                   (k1 )         (k     )
                            ∂ p−1 (f1 . . . fp−1 ) =        mk1 ...kp−1 f1         . . . fp−1
                                                                                            p−1
                                                                                                .

Hence, the congruence in Theorem 3 is equivalent to
                       X
                              ∂fσ(p−1) ∂fσ(p−2) . . . ∂fσ(1) ≡ ∂ p−1 (f1 . . . fp−1 ) mod p
                  σ∈Sp−1


which becomes, after substituting f1 = . . . = fp−1 = f ,

                                       (p − 1)!(∂f )p−1 ≡ ∂ p−1 f p−1 mod p

(the last two congruences are, actually, equivalent.) Since (p − 1)! ≡ −1 mod p, the last
congruence is that of Theorem 2. Thus, Theorems 2 and 3 are equivalent.
       Our last combinatorial theorem concerns a certain function on Young diagrams. To
avoid drawing, we use the term Young diagram for a finite sequence (j1 , . . . , jm ) of integers
with j1 ≥ . . . ≥ jm > 0. The sequence may be empty (m = 0). For a Young diagram J =
(j1 , . . . , jm ), we put N (J) = j1 + . . . + jm , m(J) = m, and nk (J) = #{s | js = k}. Define
a function d on Young diagrams recursively: d(∅) = 1, and if J = (j1 , . . . , jm ), N (J) = N ,
and d(K) has been already defined for all Young diagrams K with N (K) = N − 1, then
                           X
             d(J) =                  (N − js + 1)njs (J)d(j1 , . . . , js−1 , js − 1, js+1 , . . . , jm ).
                        s,js >js+1


(Here we put jm+1 = 0 and if s = m and js = 1, then js − 1 is zero, and we simply delete
this zero.)
       Theorem 4. If N (J) = p − 1 (where p is prime), then

                                                   d(J) ≡ 1 mod p.

               d(4) = 1 · 1 · d(3) = 1.

     We see that if N (J) = 2, then d(J) = 4, 1 ≡ 1 mod 3, and if N (J) = 4, then
d(J) = 576, 196, 66, 26, 1 ≡ 1 mod 5.
     Theorem 4 is equivalent to Theorem 2 restricted to the case, when f is a monic
polynomial of degree p − 1 (this case of Theorem 2 is sufficient for proving Theorem 1(c)).
     Indeed, let f (x) = (x−α1 ) . . . (x−αp−1 ) (where α1 , . . . , αp−1 ∈ F). We put x−αi = ui ;
thus, f = u1 . . . up−1 and ∂ui = 1. Let n ≤ p−1. Then (∂f )n = ∂f ∂f . . . ∂f is a symmetric
polynomial in u1 , . . . , up−1 of total degree n(p − 2) and of degree ≤ p − 1 with respect to
each variable ui . Let J = (j1 , . . . , jm ) be a Young diagram with N (J) = n. Then an
obvious induction based on the equality (∂f )n = ∂(u1 . . . up−1 (∂f )n−1 ) shows that the
coefficient at
                                   u1n−j1 . . . um
                                                 n−jm n
                                                     um+1 . . . unp−1
in the polynomial (∂f )n is d(J).
     On the other hand, the coefficient at the same monomial in the polynomial ∂ n (f n ) is

                     Ym
           n!                                                n!           n!              n!
                         n(n − 1) . . . (n − ji + 1) =                            ...

                                                                                         n         n
                                                                                  = n!       ...     .
                                                                                         j1       jm

                               p−1
Since (p − 1)! ≡ −1 mod p and        ≡ (−1)j mod p, the last quantity for n = p − 1 is
                                j
                                    
                        p−1        p−1
              (p − 1)!        ...        ≡ (−1) · (−1)j1 · . . . · (−1)jm mod p,
                         j1         jm

and (−1) · (−1)j1 · . . . · (−1)jm = (−1)p = −1 (if p is odd; if p = 2, then −1 ≡ 1 mod p).
Thus, Theorem 2 with f = ui . . . up−1 is equivalent to Theorem 4.
     We conclude this section with three remarks concerning Theorem 4. First, we will
never mention this theorem again; certainly, it follows from the other theorems of this
section, but we do not have any direct proof for it. Still we think that it deserves to be
stated as one of the results of this paper. Second, this Theorem may have some meaning

                                                    4
in the representation theory of symmetric groups, but this meaning evades us. Third, it
is not hard to deduce from Theorem 4 that the congruence d(J) ≡ 1 mod p holds also if
N (J) = p−2 (check this for p = 3 and 5 using the example after the statement of Theorem
4). We leave this to the reader as an exercise.
     4. Proofs. We will prove Theorem 3 (using its relations to propositions similar to
Theorems 1 and 2). As we know, this will imply all the other theorems of this paper.
         f = Der F[x]. This is an infinite dimensional restricted Lie algebra. Elements of
     Let W
f are “vector fields” f ∂, f ∈ F[x]. The p-th power of a derivation f ∂ is also a derivation:
W
(f ∂)p = F ∂, F ∈ F[x]. Raising f ∂ to the power p, we get

                                   F1 ∂ + F2 ∂ 2 + . . . + Fp ∂ p = F ∂

(where F1 = f · (∂(f ∂(. . . (f ∂f ) . . .))), Fp = f p ). Applying both sides of this equality to
(x − a)k , where 1 < k < p and a ∈ F, and then setting x = a, we get

                                               Fk (a) · k! = 0,

which shows that F2 = . . . = Fp−1 = 0. Since ∂ p = 0 on F[x], we see that

                            F = F1 = f g, g = (∂f )p−1 = ∂f ∂f . . . ∂f.

But [(f ∂)[p] , f ∂] = 0; hence, [f g∂, f ∂] = (f gf ′ − f f ′ g − f 2 g ′ )∂ = −f 2 g ′ ∂ = 0, that is,
g ′ = 0 (for f 6= 0, and therefore for any f ). (Actually, this means that g is a polynomial
in xp , but we will not need this.)
     Consider differential expression

                              g(f ) = ∂∂f ∂f . . . ∂f (p ∂ ′ s, p − 1 f ′ s).

Polarize the restriction of the form f 7→ (g(f ))(a), a ∈ F of degree p − 1 to the vector space
of polynomials of degree < p. We get a symmetric (p − 1)-linear form
                                               X
                    G(f1 , . . . , fp−1 ) =            (∂∂fσ(1)∂fσ(2) . . . ∂fσ(p−1) )(a)
                                              σ∈Sp−1


which is equal to 0, since g ′ (f ) = 0. As a differential expression, the right hand side of the
                                                             (j ) (j )    (jp−1 )
last equality is a linear combination of monomials f1 1 f2 2 . . . fp−1           (a) with j1 + j2 +
                                                   i1                    ip−1
. . . + jp−1 = p, but plugging f1 = (x − a) , . . . , fp−1 = (x − a)           with all i1 , . . . , ip−1
between 0 and p − 1 and equating the results to 0, we see that all the monomials with
j1 < p, . . . , jp−1 < p have zero coefficients in F (that is, they are 0 modulo p). Since the
                              (p)
coefficient at f1 . . . fs−1 fs fs+1 . . . fp−1 is obviously (p − 2)! ≡ 1 mod p, we arrive at the
conclusion:
                                                   p−1
               X                                   X
                      ∂∂fσ(1) . . . ∂fσ(p−1) ≡           f1 . . . fs−1 fs(p) fs+1 . . . fp−1 mod p,
             σ∈Sp−1                                s=1


                                                         5
which may be rewritten as
 X
         tσ(1) (tσ(1) + tσ(2) ) . . . (tσ(1) + . . . + tσ(p−1) )(t1 + . . . + tp−1 ) ≡ tp1 + . . . + tpp−1 mod p
σ∈Sp−1


(the last factor in the left hand side of the last formula arises from the first ∂ in the left
hand side of the previous formula). But tp1 +. . .+tpp−1 ≡ (t1 +. . .+tp−1 )p mod p. Canceling
t1 + . . . + tp−1 , we obtain the congruence of Theorem 3.
