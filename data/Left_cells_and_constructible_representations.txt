                                                    Abstract. We consider the partition of a finite Coxeter group W into left
                                                    cells with respect to a weight function L. In the equal parameter case, Lusztig
                                                    has shown that the representations carried by the left cells are precisely the
                                                    so-called constructible ones. We show that this holds for general L, assuming
                                                    that the conjectural properties (P1)–(P15) in Lusztig’s book on Hecke alge-
                                                    bras with unequal parameters hold for W, L. Our proofs use the idea (Gyoja,
                                                    Rouquier) that left cell representations are projective in the sense of modular
                                                    representation theory. This also gives partly new proofs for Lusztig’s result in
                                                    the equal parameter case.




                                                                                1. Introduction
                                               Let W be a finite Coxeter group and L be a weight function on W , as in [26].
                                            Thus, L is a function L : W → Z such that L(ww′ ) = L(w) + L(w′ ) whenever
                                            l(ww′ ) = l(w)+l(w′ ) where l is the length function on W . We assume that L(w) > 0
                                            for all w 6= 1. The choice of such an L gives rise to a partition of W into left cells;
                                            each left cell naturally carries a representation of W . These representations play an
                                            important role, for example, in the representation theory of reductive groups over
                                            finite or p-adic fields; see [23], [26, Chap. 0]. In the case where L = al for some
                                            a > 0, the representations carried by the left cells are explicitly known: by Lusztig
                                            [24], they are precisely the constructible representations which were defined (and
                                            determined) in [22].
                                               Let us now consider a general weight function L and let us assume that the
                                            conjectural properties (P1)–(P15) in [26, Chap. 14] hold; we recall these properties
                                            and some of their consequences in Section 2. The purpose of this paper is to prove
                                            that, in this setting, the left cell representations are again the constructible ones,
                                            as conjectured by Lusztig [26, 22.29]. Our arguments also cover the case of equal
                                            parameters, so that we obtain partly new proofs for Lusztig’s results in [24].
                                               The main theme of this paper is to use a generalization of a result of Rouquier [29]
                                            which shows that left cell representations can be interpreted as projective indecom-
                                            posable representations in the sense of modular representation theory. Rouquier’s
                                            original result was concerned with the equal parameter case. The proof of its gen-
                                            eralisation to arbitrary weight functions relies on (P1)–(P15); see Section 3. In this
                                            context, a crucial role is played by a general result from [15] which shows that the
                                            columns of the “decomposition matrix” are linearly independent; see (3.9). This
                                            result yields, for example, the fact that the representations carried by the various
                                            left cells of W are linearly independent in the appropriate Grothendieck group; see
                                            Remark 3.12.

   See Gyoja [17] where the connection between left cells and modular representa-
tions first appeared.
   Further general results on left cells, constructible representations and families
will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5.
   In order to deal with type Bm (Section 6), we need a purely combinatorial
identity about the constructible representations; see Proposition 6.2. We shall give
here an elementary proof of that identity which uses the fact that the constructible
representations can be identified with the canonical basis of a certain irreducible
representation of the Lie algebra sln+1 (C), as shown by Leclerc–Miyachi [20]. (I
wish to thank Bernard Leclerc for his help with the proof of Proposition 6.2.)
   Our methods provide new proofs for type Dm and Bm with equal parameters.
   Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the computation of left cell representations in
groups of exceptional type. For groups of type E6 , E7 , E8 and F4 with equal
parameters, we show that Lusztig’s proof in [24], which partly relies on deep results
about representations of reductive groups over finite fields [23], can be replaced by
arguments which only rely on (P1)–(P15) and some explicit computations with the
character tables in [14].

                            2. Lusztig’s conjectures
   Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system where W is finite; let L : W → Z be a weight
function such that L(s) > 0 for all s ∈ S. Let A = Z[v, v −1 ] where v is an
indeterminate. We set vw = v L(w) for all w ∈ W . Let H be the generic Iwahori–
Hecke algebra corresponding to (W, S) with parameters {vs | s ∈ S}. Thus, H has
an A-basis {Tw | w ∈ W } and the multiplication is given by the rule
                     
                               Tsw             if l(sw) = l(w) + 1,
             Ts Tw =
                       Tsw + (vs − vs−1 )Tw    if l(sw) = l(w) − 1,
where s ∈ S and w ∈ W . Let {cw |Pw ∈ W } be the “new” basis of H defined in [26,
Theorem 5.2]. We have cw = Tw + y py,w Ty where py,w ∈ v −1 Z[v −1 ] and pyw = 0
unless y < w in the Bruhat–Chevalley order. Given x, y ∈ W , we can write
                            X
                    cx cy =    hx,y,z cz   where hx,y,z ∈ A.
                             z∈W

We usually work with the elements c†w obtained by applying the unique A-algebra
involution H → H, h 7→ h† such that Ts† = −Ts−1 for any s ∈ S; see [26, 3.5].
   We refer to [26, Chap. 8] for the definition of the preorders 6L , 6R , 6LR and the
corresponding equivalence relations ∼L , ∼R , ∼LR . (See also Remark 2.4 below.)
The equivalence classes with respect to these relations are called left, right and
two-sided cells, respectively.
   Let Γ be a left cell of W . As in [26, 21.1], the A-submodule
                                             X
                                    [Γ]A :=      Ac†y
                                           y∈Γ

of H can be regarded as an H-module by the rule c†x · c†y = z∈Γ hx,y,z c†z where
                                                                  P
x ∈ W , y ∈ Γ. By change of scalars (v 7→ 1) this gives rise to an C[W ]-module which
we simply denote by [Γ]. The representation [Γ] is called a left cell representation
of W .

Conjecture 2.1 (Lusztig [26, 22.29]). Let Γ be a left cell of W . Then [Γ] is a
constructible representation in the sense of [26, 22.1]. Furthermore, all constructible
representations arise in this way.

   We recall the definition of constructible representations in (4.1). Conjecture 2.1
is already known to be true if L = al for some a > 0, see [24] (for W a finite Weyl
group) and [1] (for W of type H4 ).
   We will show in Sections 6 and 7 that Conjecture 2.1 is true, if the general
conjectural properties (P1)–(P15) formulated by Lusztig in [26, Chap. 14] hold.
This also yields a partly new proof for finite Weyl groups and L = al for some
a > 0 (where (P1)–(P15) are known to hold; see [26, Chap. 15].) Assuming (P1)–
(P15), we already know that every constructible representation is of the form [Γ] for
some left cell Γ; see [26, Lemma 22.2]. So it remains to show that [Γ] is constructible
for every left cell Γ.
   To state (P1)–(P15), we have to introduce some further notation.
   For z ∈ W , there is a unique integer a(z) > 0 such that

                     hx,y,z ∈ v a(z) Z[v −1 ]              for all x, y ∈ W ,
                                                  −1
                     hx,y,z 6∈ v   a(z)−1
                                            Z[v        ]   for some x, y ∈ W ;

see [26, 13.6]. Given x, y, z ∈ W , we define γx,y,z−1 ∈ Z by the condition

                 hx,y,z = γx,y,z−1 v a(z) + strictly smaller powers of v.

Finally, for z ∈ W , we define an integer ∆(z) > 0 and a non-zero integer nz ∈ Z by
the condition

           p1,z = nz v −∆(z) + strictly smaller powers of v;              see [26, 14.1].

Conjecture 2.2 (Lusztig [26, 14.2]). Let D = {z ∈ W | a(z) = ∆(z)}. Then the
following properties hold.
   P1.   For any z ∈ W we have a(z) 6 ∆(z).
   P2.   If d ∈ D and x, y ∈ W satisfy γx,y,d 6= 0, then x = y −1 .
   P3.   If y ∈ W , there exists a unique d ∈ D such that γy−1 ,y,d 6= 0.
   P4.   If z ′ 6LR z then a(z ′ ) > a(z). Hence, if z ′ ∼LR z, then a(z) = a(z ′ ).
   P5.   If d ∈ D, y ∈ W , γy−1 ,y,d 6= 0, then γy−1 ,y,d = nd = ±1.
   P6.   If d ∈ D, then d2 = 1.
   P7.   For any x, y, z ∈ W , we have γx,y,z = γy,z,x .
   P8.   Let x, y, z ∈ W be such that γx,y,z 6= 0. Then x ∼L y −1 , y ∼L z −1 ,
         z ∼L x−1 .
  P9.    If z ′ 6L z and a(z ′ ) = a(z), then z ′ ∼L z.
 P10.    If z ′ 6R z and a(z ′ ) = a(z), then z ′ ∼R z.
 P11.    If z ′ 6LR z and a(z ′ ) = a(z), then z ′ ∼LR z.
 P12.    Let I ⊂ S. If y ∈ WI , then a(y) computed in terms of WI is equal to a(y)
         computed in terms of W .
 P13.    Any left cell Γ of W contains a unique element d ∈ D. We have γx−1 ,x,d 6= 0
         for all x ∈ Γ.
 P14.    For any z ∈ W , we have z ∼LR z −1 .
 P15.    Let v ′ be a second indeterminate and let h′x,y,z ∈ Z[v ′ , v ′−1 ] be obtained from
         hx,y,z by the substitution v 7→ v ′ . If x, x′ , y, w ∈ W satisfy a(w) = a(y),
4                                       MEINOLF GECK


        then
                      X                               X
                              h′w,x′ ,y′ hx,y′ ,y =            hx,w,y′ h′y′ ,x′ ,y .
                     y ′ ∈W                           y ′ ∈W

   By [26, Chap. 15], the above conjectures hold if L = al for some a > 0. We shall
assume from now on that the above conjectures hold for W, L. Then we can define
a new algebra J over Z as in [26, Chap. 18]. As a Z-module, J is free with a basis
{tw | w ∈ W }. The multiplication is defined by
                                      X
                              tx ty =     γx,y,z tz−1 .
                                               z∈W

This
P multiplication is associative and we have an identity element given by 1J =
  d∈D nd td . Furthermore, we have a homomorphism of A-algebras φ : H → JA =
A ⊗Z J given by
                               X
                     φ(c†w ) =       hw,d,z n̂z tz (w ∈ W ),
                                   z∈W,d∈D
                                   a(z)=a(d)



where n̂z is defined as follows. For any z ∈ W , we set n̂z = nd where d is the unique
element of D such that d ∼L z −1 and nd = ±1; see (P5).

Remark 2.3. Let w, z ∈ W and assume that there exists some d ∈ D such that
a(z) = a(d) and hw,d,z 6= 0. Then we have z 6L d. So (P9) implies that z ∼L d.
But then (P13) shows that d is the unique element of D in the same left cell as z.
Thus, we have in fact
                                      X
                            φ(c†w ) =   n̂z hw,dz ,z tz
                                               z∈W

where, for any z ∈ W , we denote by dz the unique element of D in the same left
cell as z. We have

                 ±v e det(φ) ∈ 1 + vZ[v]
                                                     P
                                          where e = w a(w).

Indeed, let w ∈ W . Then, by (P2), (P4), (P5) and (P12), we have

    v a(w) φ(c†w ) = ±tw + vZ[v]-combination of elements tz where a(z) = a(w)
                        + A-combination of elements tx where a(x) > a(w).

Hence we see that the matrix of φ has a block triangular shape, when we order the
elements of W according to increasing value of a. Furthermore, inside a diagonal
block, the coefficients have leading term ±v a(w) on the diagonal and strictly smaller
leading term off the diagonal.

Remark 2.4. Using J, the relations ∼L , ∼R , ∼LR can be characterized as follows
(see [26, Prop. 18.4]):
     • We have x ∼L y if and only if tx ty−1 6= 0.
     • We have x ∼R y if and only if tx−1 ty 6= 0.
     • We have x ∼LR y if and only if tx tw ty 6= 0 for some w ∈ W .

                           3. Cells and idempotents
   The purpose of this section is to generalize the main result of Rouquier [29] to
the unequal parameter case, assuming that (P1)–(P15) hold.
   Let B0 be the set of two-sided cells in W . We set
                                X
                          tc =        n d td   for c ∈ B0 .
                               d∈D∩c

Lemma 3.1. We have 1J = c∈B0 tc . Furthermore, tc tc′ = δcc′ tc for any c, c′ ∈
                              P
B0 . Thus, {tc | c ∈ B0 } is a set of mutually orthogonal, central idempotents in J.
Proof. For c L ∈ B0 , let Jc = htw | w ∈ ciZ . By (P8), Jc is a two-sided
                                                                     P ideal in J;
we have J = c∈B0 Jc . This yields a unique decomposition 1J = c∈B0 ec where
ec ∈ Jc . Here, {ec | c ∈ B0 } Pis a set of mutually orthogonal, central idempotents.
                                                                           P
For c ∈ B0 , let us write ec = w∈c ac,w tw where ac,w ∈ Z. Since 1J = d∈D nd td ,
we conclude that ac,w = nw for w ∈ D ∩ c, and 0 otherwise. Thus, we have ec = tc
as required.                                                                       

Lemma 3.2. Let Γ be a left cell and let D ∩ Γ = {d}. Then we have nd tw td = tw
for any w ∈ Γ. Furthermore, we have
                  Jtd = hty | y ∈ ΓiZ    and     (nd td )2 = nd td .
Proof. Let y ∈ W . We have ty td = x∈W γy,d,x tx−1 where γy,d,x ∈ Z. If x = y −1
                                     P
and y ∈ Γ, then γy,d,x = γx,y,d = nd = ±1 by (P5), (P7), (P12). Now consider any
x ∈ W and assume that γy,d,x 6= 0. We must show that x = y −1 and y ∈ Γ. Now,
by (P7), we have γx,y,d = γy,d,x 6= 0. By (P2) and (P8), this implies x = y −1 and
y ∈ Γ, as required.                                                              

   We shall see that each nd td actually is a primitive idempotent in J. In fact, this
will even work when we extend scalars from Z to suitable larger rings. In order
to describe the required conditions on such a larger ring, we recall the following
constructions.
3.3. The simple JC -modules. Upon substituting v 7→ 1, the algebra H specialises
to Z[W ]. Hence, extending scalars from Z to C, we obtain an isomorphism of C-
algebras
                    φ1 : C[W ] → JC ,   where JC = C ⊗Z J;
see [26, 20.1]. Since C[W ] is split semisimple, we can now conclude that JC also is
split semisimple.
   Let Irr(W ) be the set of simple C[W ]-modules up to isomorphism. For any C[W ]-
module E, we denote the corresponding JC -module by E♠ . Thus, E♠ coincides with
E as an C-vectorspace and the action of a ∈ JR on E♠ is the same as the action of
φ−1
 1 (a) on E; see [26, 20.2]. Then we have

                           Irr(JC ) = {E♠ | E ∈ Irr(W )},
where Irr(JC ) is the set of simple JC -modules up to isomorphism. We shall also
need the fact that JC is a symmetric algebra, with trace form τ : JC → C given
by τ (tz ) = nz if z ∈ D and τ (tz ) = 0 otherwise. We have τ (tx ty ) = δxy,1 for any
x, y ∈ W ; see [26, 20.1]. By general results on split semisimple symmetric algebras
6                                         MEINOLF GECK


(see [14, Chap. 7]), we have
                            X              1
                 τ (tw ) =                   tr(tw , E♠ )       for all w ∈ W ,
                                          fE
                             E∈Irr(W )

where 0 6= fE ∈ C for all E ∈ Irr(W ). By [26, Lemma 20.13], we have in fact
                                  fE ∈ R          and       fE > 0.
3.4. The simple HK -modules. Let us extend scalars from A to K = C(v). Then
we obtain an isomorphism of K-algebras
           φK : HK → JK               where HK = K ⊗A H and JK = K ⊗Z J;
see [26, 20.1]. Given a C[W ]-module E, the JC -module structure on E♠ extends
in a natural way to a JK -module structure on Ev := K ⊗C E♠ . Then we can also
regard Ev as an HK -module via φK . We have
                                 Irr(HK ) = {Ev | E ∈ Irr(W )},
where Irr(HK ) is the set of simple HK -modules up to isomorphism. We have
tr(Tw , Ev ) ∈ C[v, v −1 ] for all w ∈ W and every C[W ]-module E. This yields the
following direct relation between E and Ev (see [26, 20.3]):
                   tr(w, E) = tr(Tw , Ev ) |v=1               for all w ∈ W .
The above direct relation between Irr(W ) and Irr(HK ) can also be established
without reference to the algebra J and (P1)–(P15); see [14, 8.1.7 and 9.3.5].
  Let E ∈ Irr(W ). As in [26, Prop. 20.6], define an integer aE > 0 by the condition
                         v aE tr(Tw , Ev ) ∈ C[v]        for all w ∈ W ,
                        aE −1
                    v           tr(Tw , Ev ) 6∈ C[v]     for some w ∈ W .
Note that aE depends on the choice of L. Now let
                      1   X
             cE :=            tr(Tw , Ev ) tr(Tw−1 , Ev ) ∈ C[v, v −1 ].
                   dim E
                                   w∈W

In [14], this is called the Schur element associated to E. Then, by [26, Cor. 20.11],
we have
                  cE = fE v −2aE + combination of higher powers of v,
where fE is the positive real number introduced in (3.3).
Definition 3.5. By Lemma 3.1, we have a partition
                                    a
                         Irr(W ) =      Irr(W, c)
                                                  c∈B0

where Irr(W, c) = {E ∈ Irr(W ) | tc E♠ 6= 0}. The sets Irr(W, c) may be called the
“blocks” of Irr(W ). Now fix c ∈ B0 and let R ⊆ C(v) be a notherian subring. We
say that R is c-adapted if the following condition holds:
                             n X         nE        o
(∗c )                  R∩                     nE ∈ Z ⊆ Z.
                                         fE
                                     E∈Irr(W,c)
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                         7


Example 3.6. Here are some examples of c-adapted rings R.
  (a) The subring Z ⊆ C(v) clearly satisfies (∗c ) for any c ∈ B0 .
  (b) Following Rouquier [29], let I+ = {1 + vf | f ∈ Z[v]} and O = {f /g ∈ C(v) |
f ∈ A, g ∈ I+ }. Then O is a principal ideal domain; see [29, p. 1040]. It is easily
checked that O satisfies (∗c ) for any c ∈ B0 .
  (c) Let c ∈ B0 and assume that there is a prime number p such that fE is a
power of p for any E ∈ Irr(W, c). Let Ap = {f /g ∈ C(v) | f, g ∈ A, g 6∈ pA}. Then
Ap is a noetherian local ring whose maximal ideal is the principal ideal generated
by p. It is readily checked that (∗c ) holds for Ap . Rings of this type have been used
by Gyoja [17] in the study of left cells in the equal parameter case.
Theorem 3.7 (See Rouquier [29] in the equal parameter case). Let c ∈ B0 and
R ⊆ C(v) be a c-adapted subring. By extension of scalars, we obtain an R-algebra
JR = R ⊗Z J. Then the following hold.
   (a) Let d ∈ D ∩ c. Then nd td is a primitive idempotent in JR .
   (b) tc is a primitive idempotent in the center of JR .
Proof. Let K = C(v) and consider JR as a subalgebra of JK = K ⊗Z J. Now, for
any E ∈ Irr(W ), we can extend the JC -module structure on E♠ in a natural way
to a JK -module structure on K ⊗C E♠ . The trace form τ also extends to a trace
form on JK which we denote by the same symbol. Thus, we have
                       X      1
             τ (h) =            tr(h, K ⊗C E♠ )    for any h ∈ JK .
                             fE
                      E∈Irr(W )

   (a) We begin with the following general remark. Let e ∈ JR be any primitive
idempotent such that e = etc . We regard e as an element of JK . Now, for E ∈
Irr(W ), we have eE♠ = 0 unless E ∈ Irr(W, c). Furthermore, the term tr(e, K ⊗C
E♠ ) is a non-negative integer which is less than or equal to dim E. Since e = etc ,
there is at least one E ∈ Irr(W, c) such that tr(e, K ⊗C E♠ ) > 0. Now recall from the
discussion in (3.3) that fE is a positive real number for all E ∈ Irr(W ). Combining
all these pieces of information, the above formula shows that τ (e) is a positive real
number.
   On the other hand, the defining formula for τ and the fact that e lies in JR show
that τ (e) ∈ R. Hence, using (∗c ), we conclude that
                                          n X          nE        o
              τ (e) > 0 and τ (e) ∈ R ∩                     nE ∈ Z ⊆ Z.
                                                       fE
                                           E∈Irr(W,c)

In particular, this proves that τ (e) > 1 for any primitive idempotent e ∈ JR such
that e = etc . Now let d ∈ D. By Lemma 3.2, nd td is an idempotent; furthermore,
we have τ (nd td ) = 1. Let us write nd td = e1 + · · · + en where ei are orthogonal
primitive idempotents in JR . (This is possible since R is noetherian.) Since d ∈ c,
we have ei tc = ei for all i. The above discussion shows that 1 = τ (nd td ) =
τ (e1 ) + · · · + τ (en ) > n. Thus, we must have n = 1 and so nd td is primitive.
    (b) Let c ∈ B0 and take some d ∈ D ∩ c. We consider a decomposition 1J =
e1 + · · ·+ er , where the ei are mutually orthogonal, central primitive
                                                                       Pidempotents in
JR . (This exists since R is noetherian.) We have nd td = nd td 1J = i nd td ei . Since
nd td is a primitive idempotent, there exists a unique j such that nd td ej = nd td and
nd td ei = 0 for i 6= j. Thus, we have
                         td ∈ JR ej     where      td ej 6= 0.
8                                    MEINOLF GECK


Now consider any element d′ ∈ D ∩ c. The fact that d, d′ lie in the same two-sided
cell means that there exists some w ∈ W such that td tw td′ 6= 0; see Remark 2.4.
Since td tw td′ ∈ JR ej , we also have td tw td′ ej 6= 0 and so td′ ej 6= 0. By the previous
argument, this implies td′ ∈ JR ej .
   Thus, we have shown that td′ ∈ JR ej for all d′ ∈ D ∩ c and so tc ∈ JR ej . Since
ej is a primitive idempotent, we conclude that tc = ej , as required.                     

P Recall †that, given a left cell Γ of W , we have a corresponding H-module [Γ]A =
   y∈Γ Acy . If R is any (commutative) ring containing A, let HR = R ⊗A H.
Then the H-module P   structure on [Γ]A extends in a natural way to an HR -module
structure on [Γ]R := y∈Γ Rc†y .
Corollary 3.8. Let R ⊆ C(v) be a noetherian subring such that O ⊆ R. Let Γ be a
left cell of W . Then [Γ]R is a projective HR -module. Furthermore, if Γ is contained
in c ∈ B0 and R is c-adapted, then [Γ]R is indecomposable.
Proof. By extension of scalars, we obtain a homomorphism φR : HR → JR of R-
algebras. By Remark 2.3, det(φ) is invertible in O ⊆ R; hence φR is an isomorphism.
Now let D ∩ Γ = {d}. By Lemma 3.2, we have
                                  JR td = hty | y ∈ ΓiR .
Now, since nd td is an idempotent, JR td is a projective JR -module. Using φR , we
may also regard JR td as an HR -module. Thus, the action of h ∈ HR on JR td
is given by h ∗ ty := φ(h)ty (y ∈ Γ). Since φR is an isomorphism, the resulting
HR -module is projective. Finally, consider the R-linear bijection
                            θ : JR td → [Γ]R ,     ty 7→ n̂y c†y .
By a computation analogous to that in [26, 18.10], we obtain
                                   X
        c†w ∗ ty = φ(c†w )ty = n̂y   hw,y,u n̂u tu for any w ∈ W , y ∈ Γ.
                                   u∈Γ

Applying θ yields       ∗ ty ) = c†w · θ(ty ). Thus, θ is an HR -module isomorphism.
                    θ(c†w
Consequently, [Γ]R is a projective HR -module.
  If Γ ⊆ c and R is c-adapted, then nd td is a primitive idempotent by Theorem 3.7
and so [Γ]R is seen to be indecomposable.                                         

   Note that the statement of Corollary 3.8 only involves the notion of a left cell
of W . The ring J and the properties (P1)–(P15) are needed in the proof. It would
be very interesting to find a more elementary proof.
3.9. Left cells and decomposition numbers. Assume that we have a discrete
valuation ring R ⊆ C(v) such that O ⊆ R, where O is the ring in Example 3.6(b).
Assume, furthermore, that
(0)       HF = F ⊗R HR is split semisimple and Hk = k ⊗R HR is split,
where F is the field of fractions of R and k is the residue field of R. As pointed
out in [16, §3], these assumptions imply that the Krull–Schmidt Theorem holds for
HR -modules which are finitely generated and free over R; furthermore, idempotents
can be lifted from Hk to HR . (That is, we don’t have to pass to a completion of
R as is usually done in the modular representation theory of finite groups and
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                         9


associative algebras.) Now we are in the general setting of [14, §7.5]. The canonical
map R → k induces a decomposition map
                               dR : R0 (HF ) → R0 (Hk )
between the Grothendieck groups of finite-dimensional representations of HF and
Hk , respectively. Let DR be the corresponding decomposition matrix. Thus, DR
has rows labelled by Irr(HF ) and columns labelled by Irr(Hk ). Note that the
                                                                                 ∼
extension of scalars from F to K = C(v) induces a natural bijection Irr(HF ) →
Irr(HK ) (since HF is assumed to be split semisimple). Thus, as in (3.4), we also
                           ∼
have a bijection Irr(HF ) → Irr(W ).
   Now the entries of DR are given as follows. Consider the projective indecom-
posable HR -modules (PIM’s for short). Every PIM has a unique simple quotient,
which is a simple Hk -module. In fact, associating to each PIM its simple quotient
defines a bijection between isomorphism classes of PIM’s and Irr(Hk ). For each
V ∈ Irr(Hk ), choose a PIM PV with simple quotient V . Thus, {PV | V ∈ Irr(Hk )}
is the set of all PIM’s of HR , up to isomorphism. By Brauer reciprocity (see [14,
Theorem 7.5.2]), the coefficients in a fixed column of DR give the expansion of the
corresponding PIM (viewed as an HF -module by extension of scalars from R to F )
in terms of the irreducible ones. Thus, we have
                                         
(1)                     DR = [Ev : PV ]
                                           E∈Irr(W ),V ∈Irr(Hk )

where Irr(W ) indexes the rows and Irr(Hk ) indexes the columns. Here, we denote
by [Ev : PV ] the multiplicity of Ev ∈ Irr(HK ) as a simple component of PV (viewed
as an HK -module by extension of scalars). Now, since H is a symmetric algebra
with a “reduction-stable” center in the sense of [14, Def. 7.5.5], we know by a
general argument (due to Rouquier and the author, see [14, Theorem 7.5.6]) that
(2)             the columns of DR are linearly independant over Q.
Now assume, moreover, that R is c-adapted for every two-sided cell c. By Corol-
lary 3.8, [Γ]R is a PIM. Since W is the union of all left cells, we obtain all PIM’s in
this way. For each V ∈ Irr(Hk ), choose a left cell ΓV such that [ΓV ]R has simple
quotient V . Thus, {[ΓV ]R | V ∈ Irr(Hk )} is the set of all PIM’s of HR , up to
isomorphism. Thus, we finally obtain
                                        
(3)                     DR = [E : [ΓV ]]                       .
                                           E∈Irr(W ),V ∈Irr(Hk )

Here, we denote by [E : [Γ]] the multiplicity of E as a simple component of [Γ];
note that [Ev : [Γ]K ]] = [E : [Γ]] for any E ∈ Irr(W ) and any left cell Γ (see, for
example, the argument in [26, 20.5]).
  The above discussion also shows that, given any left cell Γ, there exists a unique
V ∈ Irr(Hk ) such that [Γ]R ∼  = [ΓV ]R . Thus, we also have [Γ] ∼= [ΓV ] as C[W ]-
modules.
  The above idea of relating left cells and decomposition matrices has already been
considered by Gyoja [17] in the case of equal parameters.
3.10. Construction of (F, R, k). We now give a general construction of a discrete
valuation ring R ⊇ O satisfying the hypotheses in (3.9)(0), where k has character-
istic p > 0.
10                                        MEINOLF GECK


   Let F0 be a finite extension of Q; let R0 be the ring of algebraic integers in
F0 . Let p be a prime ideal such that p ∈ p. Then k = R0 /p is a finite field of
characteristic p. Now we may choose F0 large enough so that k0 ⊗Z J is split.
(This is clearly possible.) Then Jk = k ⊗Z J also is split where k = k0 (v). Now
φk : Hk → Jk is an isomorphism (see Remark 2.3). So we conclude that Hk is split.
On the other hand, HF is split semisimple where F = F0 (v) (see [14, 9.3.5]). We
now take the ring
                R = {f /g | f, g ∈ R0 [v, v −1 ], g 6∈ p[v, v −1 ]} ⊇ Ap ⊇ O.
Then R is a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions F and residue field k.
The hypotheses in (3.9)(0) are satisfied and we have a decomposition matrix DR .
Corollary 3.11. Assume that there exists a discrete valuation R as in (3.9) which
is c-adapted for every c ∈ B0 . Then the set
             n X                                        o
                       [E : [Γ]] E  Γ any left cell of W ⊆ Q[Irr(W )]
                                   
                E∈Irr(W )

is linearly independent.
Proof. This is just another way of saying that the columns of the decomposition
matrix DR are linearly independent.                                           

Remark 3.12. If W is of classical type, then R = A2 satisfies the above hypothesis;
see Section 6. For groups of exceptional type, a ring R satisfying the hypothesis
of Corollary 3.11 no longer exists. However, one can just check by an explicit
computation (using the results in Section 7) that the above statement holds. Thus,
the statement in Corollary 3.11 is seen to hold for any W, L (assuming (P1)–(P15)).

                4. Constructible representations and families
   We preserve the set-up of the previous sections. Now we turn to constructible
representations and families. The definition relies on Lusztig’s notion of truncated
induction.
   First recall the definition of the invariants aE for any E ∈ Irr(W ); see (3.4).
Now, given any C[W ]-module E ′ , we can write uniquely E ′ ∼ = E0′ ⊕ E1′ ⊕ E2′ ⊕ · · ·
where, for any integer i, we define
                M
        Ea′ :=     [E : E ′ ] E (sum over all E ∈ Irr(W ) such that aE = i);
                 E

here, [E : E ] denotes the multiplicity of E as a simple component of E ′ . Now let
            ′

I ⊂ S and consider the parabolic subgroup WI ⊂ W . Let E ′ be any C[WI ]-module
and denote by IndSI (E ′ ) the corresponding C[W ]-module obtained by induction.
Then, as above, we can write uniquely
            IndSI (E ′ ) ∼
                         = E0 ⊕ E1 ⊕ E2 ⊕ · · · ,            where E = IndSI (E ′ ).
It is shown in [26, 20.15] that if E ′ = Ea′ 6= {0} for some a, then we have
            IndSI (E ′ ) ∼
                         = Ea ⊕ Ea+1 ⊕ Ea+2 ⊕ · · · ,                 where Ea 6= {0}.
In this case, we set   JSI (E ′ )   := Ea . Thus,   JSI (E ′ )   is a C[W ]-module such that
                            IndSI (E ′ ) ∼
                                         = JSI (E ′ ) ⊕ higher terms,
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                         11


where “higher terms” means a direct sum of simple W -modules with a-invariant
strictly bigger than a. This is precisely Lusztig’s truncated induction in [26, 20.15].

4.1. Constructible representations and families. Following Lusztig [26, 22.1],
we define the set Con(W ) of constructible representations of W (with respect to
the fixed weight function L). This is done by induction on |W |. If W = {1}, then
Con(W ) consists of the unit representation. If W 6= {1}, then Con(W ) consists of
the C[W ]-modules of the form JSI (E ′ ) or JSI (E ′ ) ⊗ sgn, for various subsets I $ S
and various E ′ ∈ Con(WI ).
   We define a corresponding “decomposition matrix” D as follows. The rows are
labelled by Irr(W ) and the columns are labelled by Con(W ); the coefficients in a
fixed column of D give the expansion of the corresponding constructible represen-
tation in terms of the irreducible ones.
   The matrix D has been computed explicitly (for all W, L) by Lusztig [22], [26,
Chap. 22] and Alvis–Lusztig [2] (type H4 ).
   Following Lusztig [26, 23.1], we define a graph GW as follows. The vertices of
GW are labelled by Irr(W ). Given E 6= E ′ in Irr(W ), the corresponding vertices
in GW are joined if E, E ′ both appear as simple components of some constructible
representation of W . We say that E, E ′ ∈ Irr(W ) belong to the same family if the
corresponding vertices are in the same connected component of GW .
   The partition of Irr(W ) and Con(W ) according to families gives rise to a block
diagonal shape of D, with one block on the diagonal for each family.

Remark 4.2. One may also consider the following set Con′ (W ) of representations
of W (with respect to the fixed weight function L). The definition of Con′ (W )
appears, in a slightly refined form, in Malle–Rouquier [27, §2].
   Again, we proceed by induction on |W |. If W = {1}, then Con′ (W ) consists of
the unit representation. If W 6= {1}, then Con′ (W ) consists of all C[W ]-modules of
the form Ei , where E = IndSI (E ′ ), for various subsets I ⊆ S such that |I| = |S| − 1,
various E ′ ∈ Con′ (WI ) and various i ∈ Z. It is clear that
                                Con(W ) ⊆ Con′ (W ).
Note that we certainly do not have Con(W ) = Con′ (W ) in general. For example,
for W of type E7 , we have 2 · (512a ⊕ 512′a) ∈ Con′ (W ) \ Con(W ) (see the discussion
in (7.6) below). In Remark 5.4, we shall see that Con′ (W ) ⊆ N[Con(W )]

Theorem 4.3 (Lusztig, Rouquier). Let O ⊆ C(v) be the subring defined in Exam-
ple 3.6(b). Assume that (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. Let E, E ′ ∈ Irr(W ). Then the
following conditions are equivalent.
    (a) E, E ′ belong to the same family, in the sense of (4.1).
    (b) E, E ′ belong to the same two-sided cell, that is, there exists some c ∈ B0
                                     ′
        such that tc E♠ 6= 0 and tc E♠ 6= 0; see [26, 20.2].
             ′
    (c) E, E belong to the same block of HO , that is, there exists a primitive idem-
        potent e in the center of HO such that eEv 6= 0 and eEv′ 6= 0.
Furthermore, if E, E ′ belong to the same family, then aE = aE ′ .

Proof. For the equivalence of (a) and (b), see the argument in the proof of [26,
Prop. 23.3]. The equivalence of (b) and (c) is an immediate consequence of Theo-
rem 3.7(b). For the statement concerning aE and aE ′ ; see [26, Prop.20.6(c)]. 
12                                 MEINOLF GECK


   The equivalence of (a) and (b) was first proved by Barbasch and Vogan in the
equal parameter case; see [23, Theorem 5.25]. The equivalence of (b) and (c) has
been established by Rouquier [29] in the equal parameter case. The important
point about that equivalence is that the statement in (c) is independent of the
Kazhdan–Lusztig basis {cw } of H. As such, it applies to a wider class of algebras;
see Broué–Kim [7] and Malle–Rouquier [27].
   We now establish some results which will be helpful for the computation of
the left cell representations. The discussion mainly follows [26]. Note that the
statements in Lemmas 4.4 and 4.6 (and the corollaries following them) do not
involve the properties (P1)–(P15): these are only implicit in the proofs. It would
be very interesting to prove any of those statements by elementary methods.
Lemma 4.4. Let Γ be a left cell of W . Then all simple components of [Γ] belong to
a fixed family of Irr(W ). In particular, all simple components of [Γ] have the same
a-invariant.
Proof. Let D ∩ Γ = {d}. If E, E ′ are simple components of [Γ], then td acts
                              ′
non-trivially on E♠ and on E♠   ; see [26, Prop. 21.4]. Consequently, we also have
tc E♠ 6= 0 and tc E♠ 6= 0, where c is the two-sided cell containing d. Thus, E, E ′
                   ′

belong to the same two-sided cell. Now the assertion follows from Theorem 4.3. 
Lemma 4.5. Let Γ be a left cell of W . Then Γw0 also is a left cell of W , where w0
is the unique element of maximal length of W . We have [Γw0 ] ∼  = [Γ] ⊗ sgn where
sgn is the sign representation of W .
Proof. See [26, Cor. 11.7] and [26, Prop. 21.5]. Here, (P1)–(P15) are not needed. 
   The following result is an extremely strong condition on the expansion of a left
cell representation in terms of the irreducible ones.
Lemma 4.6. Let Γ be a left cell of W . Then we have
                                  X      1
                          1=               [E : [Γ]].
                                        fE
                                  E∈Irr(W )

Here, [E : [Γ]] denotes the multiplicity of E as a simple component of [Γ].
Proof. Let Γ ∩ D = {d} and nd = ±1. By [26, 19.2 and 20.1(b)], we have
                                     X     1
                      nd = τ (td ) =          tr(td , E♠ ).
                                          fE
                                      E∈Irr(W )

On the other hand, by [26, Prop. 21.4], we have nd tr(td , E♠ ) = [E : [Γ]] for every
E ∈ Irr(W ). This yields the desired assertion.                                    
Corollary 4.7. Let Γ be a left cell of W . Assume that there exists some E ∈ Irr(W )
such that [E : [Γ]] 6= 0 and fE = 1. Then [Γ] ∼= E ∈ Irr(W ) and [Γ] is constructible.
Proof. Let Irr(W ) = {E1 , . . . , Er } where E1 = E. We write [Γ] ∼
                                                                          Lr
                                                                       =     i=1 ni Ei
where ni ∈ Z>0 . Then, by Lemma 4.6, we have
                               r                r
                              X   1            X   1
                         1=          ni = n1 +        ni .
                                 f
                              i=1 Ei
                                                  f
                                               i=2 Ei
Now note that n1 = [E : [Γ]] is a positive integer and that fEi > 0 for all i. Hence
we must have n1 = 1 and ni = 0 for all i > 1.
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                          13


   To prove that E ∼= [Γ] is constructible, we argue as follows. By [26, Prop. 22.3],
there exists some constructible representation E ′ of W which contains a simple
component isomorphic to E. By [26, Lemma 22.2], there exists a left cell Γ′ such
E′ ∼
   = [Γ′ ]. Thus, E is a simple component of [Γ′ ]. By the previous argument, we
       = [Γ′ ] and so E ∼
have E ∼                = E ′ , as desired.                                        
Corollary 4.8. Assume that fE = 1 for all E ∈ Irr(W ). Then [Γ] is irreducible
and constructible for every left cell Γ.
Proof. Immediate by Corollary 4.7.                                                     
Example 4.9. Assume that W is of type Am−1 (m > 2) with generators and
relations given by the following diagram:
                            s1        s2                      sm−1
              Am−1           t         t         q q q         t

All generators are conjugate in W . So every weight function is of the form L = al
where a > 0. We have fE = 1 for all E ∈ Irr(W ); see [26, 22.4]. Now Corollary 4.8
shows that [Γ] is irreducible and constructible for every left cell Γ. On the other
hand, by [26, 22.5], the irreducible representations are precisely the constructible
ones. The fact that [Γ] is irreducible for every left cell Γ has been already established
by Kazhdan–Lusztig [19, §5]; for a more detailed and completely elementary proof,
see Ariki [4].
Example 4.10. Let W be of type Bm (m > 2), with generators and relations given
by the following diagram:
                   t         s1        s2                     sm−1
       Bm           t        t         t         q q q         t

Let L be a weight function such that
         L(t) = b > 0      and      L(s1 ) = L(s2 ) = · · · = L(sm−1 ) = a > 0.
Assume that (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. As in [26, 22.6], we write b = ar + b′ where
r, b′ ∈ Z such that r > 0 and 0 6 b′ < a.
    Assume first that b′ > 0. Then we have fE = 1 for all E ∈ Irr(W ); see [26,
Prop. 22.14(a)]. So Corollary 4.8 shows that [Γ] ∈ Irr(W ) for all left cells Γ. On
the other hand, the constructible representations are precisely the irreducible ones
by [26, Prop. 22.25]. In particular, Conjecture 2.1 holds for W, L if b′ > 0. The
case where b′ = 0 will be considered in Section 6.
Remark 4.11. Let W be of type Bm with parameters given as above. Assume
that b/a is “large”. Then the left cells are explicitly determined by Bonnafé–
Iancu [6] (without using the assumption that (P1)–(P15) hold); the corresponding
representations are irreducible and constructible. There is some hope that similar
arguments might be found to deal with arbitrary values of a and b, as long as a
does not divide b.
   Finally,
      L we present some further conditions on the coefficients in the expansion
[Γ] ∼
    = E [E : Γ]] E for a left cell Γ. This will also be needed in the discussion of
type E8 in (7.7). The desired conditions follow from results in [15] concerning the
center of H; we shall follow the exposition in [14].

4.12. Central characters. Let Z(H) be the center of H. An element z ∈ Z(H)
acts by a scalar in every simple HK -modules Ev , where E ∈ Irr(W ); we denote
that scalar by ωE (z). For technical simplicity, let us now assume that W is a Weyl
group; then Q is a splitting field for W and Q(v) is a splitting field for H; see [14,
Thoerem 9.3.5]. Consequently, since A is integrally closed in Q(v), we have
(a)              ωE (z) ∈ A     for any E ∈ Irr(W ) and z ∈ Z(H).
Now let R ⊆ C(v) be a noetherian subring such that O ⊆ R, where O is the ring
in Example 3.6(b). Let e ∈ HR be an indempotent and consider the corresponding
projective HR -module P := HR e. Extending scalars from R to K, we obtain an
HK -module PK . We denote
       [E : P ] = [Ev : PK ] := multiplicity of Ev in PK , for any E ∈ Irr(W ).
Then the argument in the proof of [14, Theorem 7.5.3] shows that
              X        1
(b)                      [E : P ] ωE (zC ) ∈ R  for any z ∈ Z(H).
                      cE
              E∈Irr(W,c)

This yields rather restrictive conditions on the coefficients [E : P ].
   By Corollary 3.8, we can apply this, in particular, to the module P = [Γ]R for
a left cell Γ of W . Note that, for z = 1, we have ωE (1) = 1 for all E and so the
above condition bears some resemblance to that in Lemma 4.6.
   In order to be able to use the formula (b), we shall need to compute ωE (z) for
some elements z ∈ Z(H).
   Now, by [14, Cor. 8.2.5], there is a distinguished A-basis of Z(H), denoted by
{zC | C ∈ Cl(W )} where Cl(W ) is the set of conjugacy classes of W . The scalars
ωE (zC ) are determined by the following identity:
                                                            if E ∼
                                                                 = E′,
                                                    
                 X                                    cE
(c)                   vw tr(TwC , Ev ) ωE ′ (zC ) =
                                                       0    otherwise;
             C∈Cl(W )

see [14, Exc. 9.5]. Here, wC is an element of minimal length in C ∈ Cl(W ). Note
that, by [14, Cor. 8.2.6], the value tr(TwC , Ev ) does not depend on the choice of
wC . The “character tables”
                                        
                            tr(TwC , Ev )
                                         E∈Irr(W ),C∈Cl(W )

are explicitly known for all W, L; see [14]. As explained in the proof of [14,
Prop. 11.5.13], the identities (c) can be used to compute the scalars ωE (zC ).


                5. Induction and restriction of left cells
   Let I ⊆ S and consider the parabolic subgroup WI . The restriction of L to WI
is a weight function on WI . Thus, we have a partition of WI into left cells with
respect to L|WI . We shall now consider the compatibility of the corresponding left
cell representations with respect to induction and restriction. All the results that
we are going to present here were already known in the case of equal parameters.
However, new arguments are needed in the proofs for some of these results in the
unequal parameter case (most notably Lemmas 5.2, 5.5 and 5.6).
                 LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                               15


Lemma 5.1 (See Barbasch–Vogan [5, Prop. 3.11] in the equal parameter case).
Let Γ be a left cell of W and I ⊂ S. Then there exist (pairwise different) left cells
Γ′1 , . . . , Γ′r of WI and positive integers n1 , . . . , nr such that

                            ResSI ([Γ]) ∼
                                        = n1 [Γ′1 ] ⊕ · · · ⊕ nr [Γ′r ].
Proof. We follow the proof given by Roichman [28, Theorem 5.2] in the equal
parameter case.
   Recall the definition of the relation 6L on W : this is the transitive closure of
the relation “y ←L w if hs,w,y 6= 0 for some s ∈ S”; see [26, 8.1].
   We define a relation 6L,I on W as the transitive closure of the relation “y ←L,I w
if hs,w,y 6= 0 for some s ∈ I”. Let ∼L,I be the corresponding equivalence relation
on W . The restriction of 6L,I to WI gives precisely the left cells of WI with respect
to L|WI .
   Let YI be the set of all w ∈ W such that w has minimal length in the right coset
WI w. Let u, u′ ∈ WI and x, x′ ∈ YI . Now, if ux ←L,I u′ x′ , then there exists some
s ∈ I such that hs,u′ x′ ,ux 6= 0. By the formula in [26, Prop. 6.3], we have either
ux = su′ x′ > u′ x′ or ux < u′ x′ . Thus, we have the implication
                  ux 6L,I u′ x′        and l(ux) > l(u′ x′ )       ⇒       x = x′ .
Consequently, we have the implication
                                ux ∼L,I u′ x′       ⇒     x = x′ .
This shows that there exist (pairwise different) left cells Γ′1 , . . . , Γ′r of WI and subsets
R1 , . . . , Rr of YI such that
                                       [r [
                                  Γ=            Γ′i y.
                                             i=1 y∈Ri

Now consider the restriction of the H-module [Γ]A to HI . The formula in [26,
Lemma 9.10(e)] shows that, for fixed i ∈ {1, . . . , r} and y ∈ Ri , we have
                         X
            c†s · c†uy =    hs,u,u′ c†u′ y for any s ∈ I and u ∈ Γ′i .
                           u′ ∈Γ′i


Thus, as an HI -module, we have ResSI ([Γ]A ) ∼   = n1 [Γ′1 ]A ⊕ · · · ⊕ nr [Γ′r ]A , where
ni = |Ri | for all i. Upon setting v 7→ 1, we obtain the required assertion concerning
WI -modules.                                                                             

Lemma 5.2 (See Barbasch–Vogan [5, Prop. 3.15] in the equal parameter case).
Let I ⊂ S and Γ′ be a left cell of WI . Then there exist (pairwise different) left cells
Γ1 , . . . , Γr of W such that

                               IndSI ([Γ′ ]) ∼
                                             = [Γ1 ] ⊕ · · · ⊕ [Γr ].
Proof. Let XI be the set of all x ∈ W such that x has minimal length in the left
coset xWI . Then, by [11], we have XI Γ′ = Γ1 ∐ · · · ∐ Γr where Γi are left cells of
W . So we have an HA -module

                                     Ac†xu ∼
                             X X
                [XI Γ′ ]A :=               = [Γ1 ]A ⊕ · · · ⊕ [Γr ]A .
                                     x∈XI u∈Γ′
16                                        MEINOLF GECK


Here, c†w (w ∈ W ) acts by the rule c†w · c†y = z∈XI Γ′ hx,y,z c†z for any y ∈ XI Γ′ . To
                                               P
identify this module with an induced module, we set
          I := hTx c†u | x ∈ XI , u ∈ WI , u 6L,I u′ for some u′ ∈ Γ′ iA ,
          Î := hTx c†u | x ∈ XI , u ∈ WI \ {Γ′ }, u 6L,I u′ for some u′ ∈ Γ′ iA .

Then Î ⊆ I are left ideals in HA ; see [11, Lemma 2.2]. Thus, I/Î is an HA -module;
it is free as an A-module with a basis given the residue classes of the elements Tx c†u
(x ∈ XI , u ∈ Γ′ ). By the definition of IndSI (see [14, §9.1]), we have an isomorphism
of HA -modules
                                  ∼
                     IndSI ([Γ′ ]) −→ I/Î,          Tx ⊗ c†u 7→ Tx c†u + Î.
On the other hand, by [11, Prop. 3.3], we also have
           I = hc†xu | x ∈ XI , u ∈ WI , u 6L,I u′ for some u′ ∈ Γ′ iA ,
           Î = hc†xu | x ∈ XI , u ∈ WI \ {Γ′ }, u 6L,I u′ for some u′ ∈ Γ′ iA .

Thus, I/Î also has an A-basis given by the residue classes of the elements c†xu
(x ∈ XI , u ∈ Γ′ ). Hence there is an isomorphism of HA -modules
                                      ∼
                         [XI Γ′ ]A −→ I/Î,            c†xu 7→ c†xu + Î.
Upon setting v 7→ 1, we obtain IndSI ([Γ′ ]) ∼
                                             = [Γ1 ] ⊕ · · · ⊕ [Γr ] as desired.       

Remark 5.3. The proofs of Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 do not require the assump-
tion that (P1)–(P15) hold.
Remark 5.4. We can now clarify the relation between Con(W ) and the set Con′ (W )
defined in Remark 4.2. (See Malle–Rouquier [27, Prop. 2.5] for the case of equal
parameters.) Assume that Conjecture 2.1 holds for W, L and all parabolic subgroups
of W . Then we have:
    (a) Con′ (W ) ⊆ N[Con(W )] and
    (b) the regular representation of W is a sum of constructible representations.
Indeed, using the notation in Remark 4.2, let Ei ∈ Con′ (W ) where E = IndSI (E ′ )
for some E ′ ∈ Con′ (WI ) (I $ S) and some integer i > 0. By induction, E ′ is a sum
of constructible representations. Hence, by Conjecture 2.1, E ′ is a sum of left cell
representations. Using Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 5.2, we conclude that Ei is a sum
of left cell representations and, hence (via Conjecture 2.1), a sum of constructible
representations. This proves (a). Now (b) is an easy consequence: we just have to
note that the regular representation of W (which can be obtained by inducing the
regular representation of any proper parabolic subgroup) is a sum of representations
in Con′ (W ).
Lemma 5.5. Let I ⊂ S and Γ′ be a left cell of WI . Then we have
                                          JSI ([Γ′ ]) ∼
                                                      = [Γ],
where Γ is the left cell of W such that Γ′ ⊆ Γ.
Proof. See the argument in the proof of Case 1 in [26, Lemma 22.2]. Note that
this argument is much simpler than one given in [23, 5.28.1] in the case of equal
parameters, which uses results from Barbasch–Vogan [5].                        
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                           17


Lemma 5.6 (See Lusztig [24, §3] in the equal parameter case). Let F ⊆ Irr(W ) be a
family and assume that there exists a proper subset I ⊂ S and a family F ′ ⊂ Irr(WI )
                                       ∼
such that JSI defines a bijection F ′ → F .
    Let Γ be a left cell of W and assume that all simple components of [Γ] belong to
F . Then there exists a left cell Γ′ of WI such that [Γ] ∼
                                                         = JSI ([Γ′ ]). In particular, if
  ′
[Γ ] is constructible, then so is [Γ].
Proof. Let F = {E1 , . . . , Ef }. By assumption, we have F ′ = {E1′ , . . . , Ef′ } where
Ei ∼
   = JSI (Ei′ ) for all i. Using [26, Prop. 20.13], we conclude that
           ResSI (Ei ) ∼
                       = Ei′ ⊕ combination of E ′ ∈ Irr(WI ) with aE ′ < a
whereLa = aE1 = · · · = aEf . Now let Γ be a left cell belonging to F ; we have
[Γ] ∼
    = i [Ei : [Γ]] Ei . Upon restriction to WI , we obtain
                            f
          ResSI ([Γ]) ∼
                            M
                      =           [Ei : [Γ]] Ei′ ⊕ combination of E ′ with aE ′ < a.
                            i=1

On the other hand, by Lemma 5.1, we know that ResSI ([Γ]) is a sum of left cell
representations of WI . Since all simple components of a left cell representation
belong to a fixed family, we conclude that
             f
                    [Ei : [Γ]] Ei′ ∼
             M
                                   = sum of left cell representations of WI .
              i=1

Applying JSI and using Lemma 5.5, we deduce that
                    f
           [Γ] ∼          [Ei : [Γ]] Ei ∼
                    M
               =                        = sum of left cell representations of W ,
                    i=1

where each representation occuring in the sum is obtained by J-induction of a left
cell representation of WI . Thus, to complete the proof, it is sufficient to show that
only one left cell representation occurs in the above sum. But this follows from the
following general statement:
  Let Γ, Γ1 be left cells and assume that [Γ1 ] ∼
                                                = [Γ] ⊕ E ′ for some C[W ]-module E ′ .
                                  ∼
Then we automatically have [Γ] = [Γ1 ].
  Indeed, the assumption implies that [E : [Γ]] 6 [E : Γ1 ]] for any E ∈ Irr(W ).
Hence Lemma 4.6 yields
                   X       1              X       1
              1=             [E : [Γ]] 6            [E : [Γ1 ]] = 1.
                          fE                     fE
                      E∈Irr(W )                    E∈Irr(W )

Consequently, all the inequalities must be equalities and so [Γ] ∼
                                                                 = [Γ1 ].               

   Note that the proof of Lemma 5.6 which is given in [24, §3], uses the fact that
every left cell representation has a unique “special” simple component with multi-
plicity 1; see the discussion in [23, 5.25]. This argument is no longer available in the
case of unequal parameters: there are families which do not contain any reasonably
defined “special” simple module (see, for example, [12, Remark 4.11]).

5.7. Cuspidal families. Let F be a family of Irr(W ). Then F ⊗ sgn = {E ⊗ sgn |
E ∈ F } also is a family. (This is clear by the definitions in (4.1).) As in [23,
8.1], we say that F is cuspidal if neither F nor F ⊗ sgn satisfies the hypothesis of
Lemma 5.6 for any proper subset I ⊂ S and any family F ′ of Irr(WI ).
   Suppose now we want to show that [Γ] is constructible for every left cell Γ of W .
Proceeding by induction on |S|, we may assume that [Γ′ ] is constructible for every
left cell Γ′ of a proper parabolic subgroup of W . Then, as explained in [24], it will
be enough to consider only those left cells Γ for which [Γ] belongs to a cuspidal
family of Irr(W ).
   Indeed, let Γ be a left cell such that all simple components of [Γ] belong to
a family F which is not cuspidal. Then either F itself or F ⊗ sgn satisfies the
hypothesis of Lemma 5.6 for some proper subset I ⊂ S and some family F ′ of
Irr(WI ). Assume first that F itself satisfies that hypothesis. Then there exists
a left cell Γ′ of WI such that [Γ] ∼ = JSI ([Γ′ ]). By induction, [Γ′ ] is constructible,
hence [Γ] is construcible. Now assume that F ⊗ sgn satisfies that hypothesis. Then
consider the left cell Γw0 . By Lemma 4.5, all simple components of [Γw0 ] ∼  = [Γ]⊗sgn
belong to F ⊗ sgn. Hence, as before, we may conclude that [Γw0 ] is constructible.
Consequently, [Γ] also is constructible.

                                  6. Types Bm and Dm
   We are now going to prove Conjecture 2.1 for groups of type Bm and Dm , under
the hypothesis that (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. A special case in type Bm has been
already considered in Example 4.10. (For type Am−1 , see Example 4.9.) As far as
type Dm and Bm with equal parameters are concerned, our proof is different from
the one given by Lusztig [24].
6.1. A decomposition matrix in type Bm . Let W be of type Bm (m > 2),
with generators and relations given by the following diagram:
                   t         s1        s2                        sm−1
       Bm           t        t         t         q q q            t

Let L be a weight function such that
            L(t) = r > 0      and     L(s1 ) = L(s2 ) = · · · = L(sm−1 ) = 1.
Here, we explicitly allow the case where r = 0, which is related to type Dm ; see
(6.5). The definition of left cells and constructible representations still makes sense
in this case; see [26]. Let us assume that (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. It is known
that this is the case if r = 1 (equal parameters); see [26, Chap. 15]. In Lemma 6.5,
we shall show that this also holds if r = 0.
   Recall that we have a natural parametrisation of Irr(W ) by the set Pm of all
pairs of partitions (α, β) such that |α| + |β| = m. Let us write
                           Irr(W ) = {E (α,β) | (α, β) ∈ Pm }.
By [26, Prop. 22.14], fE is a power of 2 for all E ∈ Irr(W ). So let us consider
the subring R = A2 ⊆ C(v) defined in Example 3.6(c), where p = 2. The ring
R is local, with maximal ideal 2R, residue field k = R/2R = F2 (v) and field of
fractions F = Q(v). As explained in (3.9), the canonical map R → k induces a
decomposition map
                            dr,2 : R0 (HF ) → R0 (Hk ).
                  LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                                 19


Note that HF and Hk are split and HF is semisimple; see Dipper–James–Murphy [8,
§4, §6]. Let Dr,2 be the corresponding decomposition matrix. Since R is c-adapted
for every two-sided cell c of W , we have
                                 
              Dr,2 = [E : [ΓV ]]                  ;     see (3.9)(3).
                                        E∈Irr(W ),V ∈Irr(Hk )

Note that, by (3.9)(2), the columns of Dr,2 are linearly independent. In fact, by
Dipper–James–Murphy [8, 6.5], something stronger holds: the rows and columns
may be ordered so that Dr,2 has a lower triangular shape, with 1 on the diagonal.
   The discussion in (3.9) also showed that, given any left cell Γ, there exists a
unique V ∈ Irr(Hk ) such that [Γ] ∼
                                  = [ΓV ].
   Now consider the constructible representations of W with respect to a weight
function L as above. The set Con(W ) and the corresponding “decomposition ma-
trix” matrix D r are determined by Lusztig [26, 22.24, 22.25 and 22.26] in a purely
combinatorial way. We shall need the following result.
Proposition 6.2. Let W be of type Bm (m > 2) and L be a weight function as in
(6.1). Then there exist rational numbers nP (P ∈ Con(W )) such that the following
identity holds:
                           X
                dim E =           nP [E : P ]  for any E ∈ Irr(W ).
                           P ∈Con(W )

   The following proof is due to B. Leclerc and reproduced here with his kind
permission. It requires some standard results about highest weight modules for
the Lie algebra sln+1 (C); see [20] and the references there. (This proof replaces my
earlier proof which also used results from [20] but which was much less elementary.)
Proof. First note that the above identity simply means that the regular represen-
tation of W can be written as a rational linear combination of constructible repre-
sentations. To be precise, we have to work here in the appropriate Grothendieck
group and identify a C[W ]-module Ẽ with
                            X
                                  [E : Ẽ] E ∈ Q[Irr(W )].
                              E∈Irr(W )

To prove the above assertion, we place ourselves in the setting of Leclerc–Miyachi
[20], where the constructible representations of W are interpreted in terms of canon-
ical bases. Choose large positive integers k, n. (For example, any k > m and
n > m − 1 + k + r will do; see [20, 4.1.1].) We consider the simple Lie alge-
bra g = sln+1 (C), with Chevalley generators ej , hj , fj (1 6 j 6 n). Let V (Λ)
be the highest weight module of g with highest weight Λ = Λk + Λk+r , where
Λ1 , . . . , Λn are the fundamental weights1. There is a canonical embedding of g-
modules Φ : V (Λ) → F (Λ) where F (Λ) = V (Λk+r ) ⊗ V (Λk ). The module F (Λ) has
a standard basis
                              S(Λ) = {uS | S ∈ Sy(n, k, r)}
where Sy(n, k, r) is the set of all symbols of the form
                                                            
                               1 6 β1 < · · · < βk+r 6 n + 1
(1)                       S=                                   ;
                                 1 6 γ1 < · · · < γk 6 n + 1
    1Note that, in [20], the quantized versions of these modules are considered. For our purposes,
it is enough to work with the specialisations at 1.

see [20, 2.2]. The action of the Chevalley generator fj on a basis element uS
is explicitly given by the formulas in [20, 2.1]. One notices that these formulas
constitute a refinement of the “branching rule” (see [14, 6.1.9]), that is, we have
(2)                   ind(uS ) = f1 (uS ) + f2 (uS ) + · · · + fn (uS ),
where ind(uS ) denotes the sum of all uS ′ where S ′ is a symbol as in (1) which can
be obtained from S by increasing exactly one entry by 1. (This means: we may
replace some βi by βi + 1 if the new list of coefficients still satisfies the conditions
in (1); or we may replace some γi by γi + 1 if the new list of coefficients still satisfies
the conditions in (1).)
   Let us now turn to the module V (Λ). There is a well-defined symbol S0 such
that uS0 = Φ(vΛ ) where vΛ is a highest weight vector in V (Λ); see [20, 2.2]. Thus,
we have
        Φ(V (Λ)) = hfi1 ◦ · · · ◦ fis (uS0 ) | s > 0, 1 6 i1 , . . . , is 6 niC ⊆ F (Λ).
A symbol S as in (1) is called standard if βi 6 γi for 1 6 i 6 k. Let SSy(n, k, r)
be the set of all standard symbols in Sy(n, k, r). By [20, 2.3], this set will label
the canonical basis (or lower global basis) B(Λ) of V (Λ); see, for example, Jantzen
[18] for the general theory of canonical bases. In the present situation, we can just
accept the conditions in [20, 2.4] as a definition, and then [20, Theorem 3] provides
an explicit construction of B(Λ) = {bS | S ∈ SSy(n, k, r)}. That construction
proceeds by induction on the “principal degree” d(S) of a symbol S, which is
defined as
                                                                
                         X         X          k+1         k+r+1
(3)              d(S) =      βi +      γj −           −             .
                           i        j
                                                2             2

Given d > 0, let Sy(n, k, r, d) be the set of symbols S as in (1) such that d(S) = d.
We also write
                   SSy(n, k, r, d) := Sy(n, k, r, d) ∩ SSy(n, k, r).
The Leclerc–Miyachi construction shows that, for any S ∈ SSy(n, k, r, d), there
exists an explicitly known subset C(S) ⊆ Sy(n, k, r, d) such that
                                          X
(4)                             Φ(bS ) =       uΣ .
                                               Σ∈C(S)

Let us set Wd = W (Bd ) for d = 0, 1, 2, . . .. We bring now into play the representa-
tions of Wd . By [20, 4.1.1], we may naturally label the irreducible representations
of Wd by the set of symbols in Sy(n, k, r, d). Thus, we write
                           Irr(Wd ) = {ES | S ∈ Sy(n, k, r, d)}.
Identifying uS ↔ ES for any S, we may just consider Irr(Wd ) as a subset of F (Λ)
for any d > 0. With this convention, [20, Theorem 10] states that
(5)        Con(Wd ) = {Φ(bS ) | S ∈ SSy(n, k, r, d)}            for d = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Now we have natural embeddings {1} = W0 ⊂ W1 ⊂ W2 ⊂ · · · . Using our
identification uS ↔ ES , we see that (2) does yield the “branching rule” for the
induction of representations from Wd to Wd+1 , that is, we have
             W
         IndWdd+1 (ES ) = f1 (ES ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ fn (ES ) for any S ∈ Sy(n, k, r, d).
                    LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                    21


Hence, starting with Irr(W0 ) = {1}, we obtain
(6)      (f1 + · · · + fn )d (1) = IndW
                                      W0 (1) = regular representation of Wd .
                                       d


Under the identification uS ↔ ES , the unit representation 1 of W0 corresponds to
uS0 = Φ(vΛ ). Now, the vector (f1 + · · · + fn )d (vΛ ) lies in the principal degree d
component of V (Λ) and, hence, can be expressed as a rational linear combination
of basis elements bS with d(S) = d. Applying Φ and using (5) and (6), we can
now conclude that the regular representation of Wd is a rational linear combination
of Con(Wd ), as desired. Taking d = m (which is possible since n, k were chosen
sufficiently large) yields the desired assertion.                                   
  Note that, by Remark 4.2(b), the numbers nP are actually seen to be non-
negative integers, once we have shown that Conjecture 2.1 holds.
Proposition 6.3. Let W be of type Bm (m > 2), with generators and relations
given by the diagram in Example 4.10. Let L be a weight function such that L(t) =
b > 0 and L(si ) = a > 0 for 1 6 i 6 m − 1. Assume that b = ar for some r > 1
and that (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. Then [Γ] is constructible for every left cell Γ
and all construcible representations arise in this way. Thus, Conjecture 2.1 holds
for W, L.
Proof. It is easily shown (see, for example, [12, Remark 2.15]) that the left cell
representations and the constructible representations only depend on r. Thus, we
may assume without loss of generality that a = 1 and b = r > 1. Now recall the
description of the decomposition matrix D2,r in (6.1). The representations carried
by the left cells of W are completely determined by Dr,2 .
    Now consider the constructible representations of W . Let P ∈ Con(W ). By [26,
Lemma 22.2], there exists some left cell [Γ] such that P ∼  = [Γ] as C[W ]-modules.
So we have P ∼  =  [Γ] ∼ [Γ
                       = V  ] for a unique V ∈ Irr(H k ). Thus, there exists a subset
C ′ ⊆ Irr(Hk ) such that
(1)                                   Con(W ) = {[ΓV ] | V ∈ C ′ }.
Now, by (3.9), the modules [ΓV ]R (V ∈ Irr(Hk )) are precisely the PIM’s of HR (up
to isomorphism). So we have an isomorphism of HR -modules
                          HR ∼
                                   M
                              =          (dim V ) [ΓV ]R
                                            V ∈Irr(Hk )

where HR is regarded as an HR -module via left multiplication. Extending scalars
from R to K and considering the multiplicities of simple modules, we find
                                              X
        dim E = [E : C[W ]] = [Ev : HK ] =           (dim V ) [Ev : [ΓV ]K ]
                                                          V ∈Irr(Hk )
                           X
                    =                 (dim V ) [E : [Γ]] for any E ∈ Irr(W ).
                        V ∈Irr(Hk )

Using now (1) and Proposition 6.2, we obtain the identity
        X                            X
(2)           (dim V ) [E : [ΓV ]] =   nV [E : [ΓV ]] for any E ∈ Irr(W ),
      V ∈Irr(Hk )                              V ∈C ′

where nV are certain rational numbers. By (6.1), the coefficients [E : [ΓV ]] occur-
ring in the above identity are the entries of Dr,2 . Now, by (3.9)(2), the columns of
Dr,2 are linearly independent over Q. Thus, we can compare coefficients in (2). In

particular, every summand on the left hand side must also occur on the right hand
side and so C ′ = Irr(Hk ). This shows that all representations carried by the left
cells are constructible, as desired.                                             
Remark 6.4. Let W be of type Bm and L be a weight function as in Proposition 6.3,
that is, we have b = ra for some r > 1.
   (a) The above result shows that the decomposition matrix Dr,2 in (6.1) coincides
(up to a permutation of the columns) with the “decomposition matrix” D r giving
the expansion of the constructible representations in terms of the irreducible ones.
Thus, we obtain a new proof of [20, Theorem 16], assuming that (P1)–(P15) hold.
The proof in [loc. cit.] uses the deep results of Ariki [3].
   (b) Table II in [21, p. 35] shows that L arises (in the sense explained by Lusztig
[26, Chap. 0]) in the representation theory of finite classical groups. Hence, there
is some hope that the geometric realization of H in [26, Chap. 27] will lead to a
proof of (P1)–(P15) in this case.
6.5. Type Dm . Let W1 be a Coxeter group of type Dm (m > 3) with generators
and relations given by the following diagram:
                 u  t
                    ❍
                       ❍❍ s2            s3                      sm−1
        Dm                  ❍
                            ✟ t          t        q  q q          t
                       ✟✟
                s1 ✟t
Let ω : W1 → W1 be the automorphism such that ω(u) = s1 , ω(s1 ) = u and
ω(si ) = si for i > 1. Then the semidirect product W = W1 ⋊ hωi can be naturally
identified with a Coxeter group of type Bm , with generators {ω, s1 , s2 , . . . , sm−1 }.
Regarding ω as an element of W , we have the relation ωw = ω(w)ω for all w ∈ W1 .
In particular, we have u = ωs1 ω.
   Given any C[W1 ]-module E, we can define a new C[W1 ]-module structure on E
by composing the original action with the automorphism ω. We denote that new
C[W1 ]-module by ω E.
   Recall that Irr(W ) = {E (α,β) | (α, β) ∈ Pm } see (6.1). For (α, β) ∈ Pm , we
denote by E [α,β] the restriction of E (α,β) to W1 . Then we have
                        E [α,β] ∼
                                = E [β,α] ∈ Irr(W1 )     if α 6= β,
                          E [α,α] ∼
                                  = E [α,+] ⊕ E [α,−]            if α = β,
where E  [α,±]
              ∈ Irr(W1 ) and E        [α,+]
                                              6∼
                                               = E   [α,−]   ∼
                                                             =   ω
                                                                     E [α,+] . This yields (see [14,
Chap. 5] for more details):
                     Irr(W1 ) = {E [α,β] | α 6= β} ∪ {E [α,±] | 2|α| = m}.
Let L : W → Z be the weight function such that
             L(ω) = 0         and       L(s1 ) = L(s2 ) = · · · = L(sm−1 ) = 1.
Let L1 be the restriction of L to W1 . Then L1 is just the usual length function on
W1 ; see, for example, [14, Lemma 1.4.12].
  Let H be the Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with W, L. Let H1 be the A-
subspace of H spanned by all Tw1 with w1 ∈ W1 . Then H1 is nothing but the
Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with W1 , L1 . Note Tω2 = T1 since L(ω) = 0. We
have
            Tw1 Tω = Tw1 ω and Tω Tw1 = Tω(w1 ) Tω for any w1 ∈ W1 .
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                          23


In the following discussion, it will be understood that a left cell of W1 is defined
with respect to L1 and a left cell of W is defined with respect to L.
Lemma 6.6. In the setting of (6.5), (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. Let Γ1 be a left
cell of W1 . Then ω(Γ1 ) also a left cell of W1 and
                                   Γ := Γ1 ∪ ω(Γ1 )ω
is a left cell of W . Furthermore, we have isomorphisms of C[W ]-modules
                             ∼ [Γ1 ] ⊕ [ω(Γ1 )] and [ω(Γ1 )] ∼
                  ResW ([Γ]) =                               = ω [Γ1 ].
                    W1

Proof. We consider the Kazhdan–Lusztig basis {cw | w ∈ W } of H (defined with
respect to W, L). Note that the construction of that basis in [26, Chap. 5] works
for weightP  functions with arbitrary integer values (even negative ones). We have
cw = Tw + y<w py,w Ty , where py,w ∈ v −1 Z[v −1 ]. Let y, w ∈ W and write y = y1 ω i ,
w = w1 ω j where y1 , w1 ∈ W1 and i, j ∈ {0, 1}. Then we have py,w = 0 if i 6= j
and py,w = py1 ,w1 if i = j, where py1 ,w1 is the polynomial defined with respect
to W1 , L1 ; see the remarks in [25, §3] and [9, §2]. Thus, {cw1 | w1 ∈ W1 } is the
Kazhdan–Lusztig basis of H1 (with respect to L1 ). We have cω = Tω and
             cw1 cω = cw1 ω    and cω cw1 = cω(w1 ) cω    for any w1 ∈ W1 .
Furthermore, let a(z) (z ∈ W ) be defined with respect to L, and let a1 (z1 ) (z1 ∈ W1 )
be defined with respect to L1 . Then we have
                   a(w1 ω) = a(w1 ) = a1 (w)        for any w1 ∈ W .
Now (P1)–(P15) hold for W1 , L1 ; see [26, Chap. 15]. The above relations imply
that (P1)–(P15) also hold for W, L; see [25, §3] where this is worked out explicitly.
The above relations also show that
(1)                   D = D1 = {z ∈ W | a(z) = ∆(z)} ⊆ W1 .
Let J be the Z-algebra with basis {tw | w ∈ W } defined with respect to W, L. Then
we have t2ω = t1 and
(2)           tw1 tω = tw1 ω   and tω tw1 = tω(w1 ) tω    for all w1 ∈ W1 .
Let J1 be the Z-submodule of J spanned by all elements tw1 for w1 ∈ W1 . Then
J1 is nothing but the Z-algebra defined with respect to W1 , L1 . Furthermore, the
A-algebra homomorphism φ : H → JA restricts to the homomorphism φ1 : H1 →
(J1 )A defined with respect to W1 , L1 . These remarks allow us to switch back and
forth between left cells of W1 and left cells of W . For example, the characterisation
of ∼L in Remark 2.4 shows that
(3a)            every left cell of W1 is contained in a left cell of W ;
(3b)            if Γ1 is a left cell of W1 , then so is ω(Γ1 ).
Now let Γ1 be a left cell of W1 . By (3b), we know that ω(Γ1 ) is a left cell of W1 . By
(3a), we have Γ1 ⊆ Γ where Γ is a left cell of W . First we claim that Γ ∩ W1 = Γ1 .
To see this, let us fix an element z ∈ Γ1 . Now let y ∈ Γ ∩ W1 . Since z, y ∈ Γ, we
have ty tz−1 6= 0 inside J, by Remark 2.4. Since z, y ∈ W1 , we also have ty tz−1 6= 0
inside J1 and so y ∈ Γ1 (again using Remark 2.4). Thus, the above claim is proved.
Now let y ∈ Γ and assume that y 6∈ W1 . Let us write y = y1 ω where y1 ∈ W1 . Since
y ∈ Γ, we have tz ty−1 6= 0 inside J. Using (2), we also have tz tω(y1 )−1 6= 0 inside
J1 and so ω(y1 ) ∈ Γ1 . Thus, we have shown that Γ = Γ1 ∪ ω(Γ1 )ω, as desired.

   Finally, consider the statement concerning the left cell representations. Let JCΓ :=
hty | y ∈ ΓiC ⊆ JC . By Lemma 3.2, we have JCΓ = JC td where D ∩ Γ = {d}. By [26,
Lemma 21.2], we have
                             ∼ [Γ]♠
                          JΓ =          (as C[W ]-modules).
                           C

A similar statement holds for Γ1 ⊆ W1 . Hence, we can translate the desired asser-
tion about the restriction of [Γ] from W to W1 to a statement about the restriction
of JCΓ from JC to (J1 )C . Now, the decomposition Γ = Γ1 ∪ ω(Γ1 )ω yields that
                                          ω(Γ )
                 (JCΓ ) ∼
                        = (J1 )ΓC1 ⊕ (J1 )C 1     (as C-vectorspaces).
But then (2) shows that this is an isomorphism of (J1 )C -modules. Furthermore, for
                                            ω(Γ )
any w ∈ W1 , the action of any tw on (J1 )C 1 will be the same as the action of
tω(w) = tω tw tω on (J1 )ΓC1 , as required.                                      
Proposition 6.7. Let W1 be of type Dm , as in (6.5), and let L1 be the weight
function on W1 given by the length. By [26, Chap. 15], (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L1 .
Then [Γ1 ] is constructible for every left cell [Γ1 ], and all constructible representa-
tions arise in this way. Thus, Conjecture 2.1 holds for W1 , L1 .
Proof. By [26, Lemma 22.2], we already know that every constructible representa-
tion is of the form [Γ1 ] for some left cell Γ1 . Conversely, let Γ1 be a left cell of W1 .
We must show that [Γ1 ] is constructible. For this purpose, we place ourselves in
the setting of Lemma 6.6.
   Assume first that [Γ1 ] has a simple component E1 with fE1 = 1. Then Corol-
lary 4.8 shows that [Γ1 ] is irreducible and constructible. Now assume that [Γ1 ] has
no simple component E1 with fE1 = 1. Using the formulas for fE in [26, 22.14],
we see that all simple components of [Γ1 ] must be of the form E [α,β] with α 6= β.
Thus, by Lemma 6.6, we have [ω(Γ1 )] ∼    = ω [Γ1 ] ∼
                                                    = [Γ1 ] and so
                                  Res ([Γ]) ∼
                                      W
                                       W1       = 2[Γ1 ].
Now, the argument in the proof of Proposition 6.3 also works in the present sit-
uation, where L(ω) = 0 and L(si ) = 1 for all i. Hence, [Γ] is a constructible
representation of W . Now [26, 22.26] (see also Leclerc–Miyachi [20, Theorem 13])
shows that ResWW1 ([Γ]) is twice a constructible representation of W1 . Hence [Γ1 ] is
constructible as desired.                                                           

                                7. Exceptional types
   We are now going to indicate proofs of Conjecture 2.1 for groups of exceptional
type. If W is of type E6 , E7 , E8 and F4 with equal parameters, Lusztig’s proof
[24] requires some sophisticated results from the representation theory of reductive
groups over finite field, see [23, Chap. 12]. We will show here that these arguments
can be replaced by more elementary ones, involving some explicit computations
with the character tables in [14].
7.1. Type I2 (m). Let W be of type I2 (m) (m > 3), that is, we have W = hs1 , s2 i
where s21 = s22 = (s1 s2 )m = 1. A weight function L is specified by L(s1 ) = a > 0
and L(s2 ) = b > 0 where a = b if m is odd.
   The irreducible representations of W are given as follows. We have the unit
representation 1W and sgn. If m is even, there are two further 1-dimensional rep-
resentations, which we denote by sgn1 and sgn2 . They are characterised by the
                    LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                                     25


condition that s1 acts as −1 in sgn2 and s2 acts as −1 in sgn. All other irre-
ducible representations have dimension 2; see [14, 5.3.4] for an explicit description
of these representations. We denote by τ the direct sum of all the 2-dimensional
representations.
   For any k > 0, write 1k = s1 s2 s1 · · · (k factors) and 2k = s2 s1 s2 · · · (k factors).
Then the following hold:
     (i) If m is odd, then the left cells are
           {10 },     {2m },     {21 , 12 , 23 , . . . , 1m−1 },   {11 , 22 , 13 , . . . , 2m−1 }.
         The left cell representations are 1W , sgn, τ , τ , respectively.
    (ii) If m is even and a = b, then the left cells are
           {10 },     {2m },     {21 , 12 , 23 , . . . , 2m−1 },   {11 , 22 , 13 , . . . , 1m−1 }.
         The representations are 1W , sgn, sgn1 ⊕ τ , sgn2 ⊕ τ , respectively.
   (iii) If m is even and b > a, then the left cells are
                           {10 },        {11 },         {2m−1 },         {2m },
                      {21 , 12 , 23 , . . . , 2m−2 },   {22 , 13 , 24 , . . . , 1m−1 }.
        The representations are 1W , sgn2 , sgn1 , sgn, τ , τ , respectively.
The left cells in all of the above cases are determined in [26, Chap. 8] (see also
[14, Exc. 11.4] for the case a 6= b). These computations do not require any of
the conditions (P1)–(P15). The representations carried by the left cells are easily
determined by an explicit computation; see [10, §6] for case (iii). The constructible
representations are listed in [22, §12] (a = b) and [10, §6] (b > a). In each case, the
representations carried by the left cells are precisely the constructible ones. Thus,
Conjecture 2.1 holds for W and any weight function L.
Example 7.2. Let W be of type H3 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
                         s1 5 s2       s3
                  H3      t     t       t
All generators of W are conjugate so every weight function on W is of the form
L = al for some a > 0. We have |W | = 120. Using CHEVIE [13], one can explicitly
compute the basis {cw } and all polynomials hx,y,z . By inspection, one sees that
                        pyw ∈ N[v −1 ]            and       hx,y,z ∈ N[v, v −1 ]
for all x, y, z, w ∈ W . Thus, the arguments in [26, Chap. 15] show that (P1)–(P15)
hold for W, L.
   By [26, Lemma 22.2], we already know that each constructible representation
is of the form [Γ] where Γ is a left cell of W . The constructible representations
are listed in [22, §12]. This yields the partition of Irr(W ) into families. Using the
tables for the J-induction in [14, Table D.1], it is readily checked that there are no
cuspidal families. We can now use the argument in (5.7) to conclude that all left
cell representations of W are constructible. (Of course, having computed all py,w
and all hx,y,z , one could also directly compute the left cells and the corresponding
representations.) Thus, Conjecture 2.1 holds for W .
7.3. Type H4 . Let W be of type H4 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
26                                        MEINOLF GECK

                                     s1   5
                                              s2       s3       s4
                       H4             t        t        t        t

All generators of W are conjugate so every weight function on W is of the form
L = al for some a > 0. The constructible representations are determined by Alvis–
Lusztig [2]. On the other hand, the left cells and the corresponding representations
have been explicitly computed by Alvis [1]. By inspection, one sees that the rep-
resentations carried by the left cells are precisely the constructible ones; see [1,
Prop. 3.5]. Thus, Conjecture 2.1 holds for W .
7.4. Type F4 . Let W be of type F4 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
                           s1    s2      s3    s4
                  F4        t     t > t         t

A weight function L on W is specified by two positive integers a := L(s1 ) = L(s2 ) >
0 and b := L(s3 ) = L(s4 ) > 0; we shall write L = La,b . In [12], the partition of
W into left cells has been determined for all values of a, b. Let L = La,b and
L′ = La′ ,b′ be two weight functions on W such that b > a > 0 and b′ > a′ > 0.
Then L, L′ define the same partition of W into left cells if and only if L, L′ ∈ Li
for i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, where Li are defined as follows:
                             L0 = {(c, c, c, c)     | c > 0},
                             L1 = {(c, c, 2c, 2c) | c > 0},
                             L2 = {(c, c, d, d)     | 2c > d > c > 0},
                             L3 = {(c, c, d, d)     | d > 2c > 0}.
Furthermore, if L, L′ ∈ Li , then the left cells give rise to the same representations
of W . On the other hand, the constructible representations are determined in [26,
22.27]2. By inspection, one sees that the left cell representations are precisely the
constructible ones. Thus, Conjecture 2.1 holds for W and all weight functions L.
   Note that, by Table II in [21, p. 35], only the weight functions L such that b = a,
b = 2a or b = 4a arise in the representation theory of finite reductive groups.
   For the case of equal parameters, let us indicate an argument which does not
require the explicit computation of all left cells. This will also be a model for the
discussion of groups of type E6 , E7 and E8 . So let us assume that L = al for some
a > 0. By [26, Chap. 15], the properties (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L. Hence, by [26,
Lemma 22.2], we already know that every constructible representation is carried
by a left cell of W . To prove the converse, it will now be enough to consider only
those left cells which belong to a cuspidal family of Irr(W ); see (5.7).
   By [23, 8.1], there is a unique cuspidal family F0 of Irr(W ), the one containing
the representation 121 , where we use the notation of [23, 4.10] or [14, Table C.3].
To deal with this family, we consider the parabolic subgroup WI of type B3 , where
I = S \ {s4 }. By Proposition 6.3, the left cell representations of WI are precisely
the constructible ones, and these are explicitly given in [26, 22.24].
   Now let Γ be a left cell of W belonging to F0 . Then, as in the proof of Lemma 5.2,
there exists a unique left cell Γ′ of WI such that Γ ⊆ XI Γ′ . Then [Γ] is a direct

    2As pointed out in [12, Remark 4.10], there is an error in the list of constructible representations
in [26, 22.27, Case 1], where b = 2a > 0: the representations denoted 13 ⊕ 21 and 12 ⊕ 22 have to
be removed from that list.

summand of IndSI ([Γ′ ]). Let us write

       IndSI ([Γ′ ]) ∼
                        M
                     =       mE E ⊕ combination of E ′ ∈ Irr(W ) \ {F0 },
                       E∈F0

where mE are non-negative integers. Thus, we can conclude that
           [Γ] ∼
                 M
               =     nE E      where 0 6 nE 6 mE for all E ∈ F0 .
                    E∈F0

Now the idea is to look for arithmetical conditions on the numbers nE so that
the only remaining possibilities satisfying these conditions correspond to the ex-
pansion of the constructible representations in F0 . One such condition is given by
Lemma 4.6: the numbers nE must satisfy
                                  X 1
(♦)                                        nE = 1.
                                       fE
                                   E∈F0

Inducing all constructible representations from WI to W , we can explicitly deter-
mine (using CHEVIE [13]) all possible non-zero vectors (mE )E∈F0 as above. They
are given by the columns labelled by P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 in Table
                                                                 P 1. Now, if the vector
(mE )E∈F0 is given by one of the above columns, we see that E mE /fE = 1. Thus,
(♦) shows that we must have nE = mE for all E. So [Γ] is given by one of the
above five columns. Comparison with the table of constructible respresentations in
[22, p. 223] shows that [Γ] is constructible.
7.5. Type E6 . Let W be of type E6 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
                       s1     s3     s4     s5     s6
                        t      t      t      t      t
               E6
                                           t s2

All generators of W are conjugate so every weight function on W is of the form
L = al for some a > 0. By [26, Chap. 15], the properties (P1)–(P15) hold for W, L.

Hence, by [26, Lemma 22.2], we already know that every constructible representa-
tion is carried by a left cell of W . To prove the converse, it will now be enough to
consider only those left cells which belong to a cuspidal family of Irr(W ); see (5.7).
We shall argue as in (7.4).
   By [23, 8.1], there is a unique cuspidal family F0 of Irr(W ), the one containing
the representation 80s , where we use the notation of [23, 4.11] or [14, Table C.4].
To deal with this family, we consider the parabolic subgroup WI of type D5 , where
I = S \ {s6 }. By Proposition 6.7, the left cell representations of WI are precisely
the constructible ones, and these are explicitly given in [26, 22.26]. The possibilities
for all non-zero vectors (mE )E∈F0 obtained (as above) by inducing all constructible
representations of WI are given by the following table:
                                E       fE    P1    P2   P3
                               10s       3    1      .    .
                               20s       6     .    1     .
                               60s       2    1      .   1
                               80s       6    1     1    1
                               90s       3     .    2    1
Checking (♦), we find that (nE )E∈F0 must be equal to one of the vectors (mE )E∈F0 .
So [Γ] is given by one of the above three columns. Comparison with the table of
constructible respresentations in [22, p. 223] shows that [Γ] is constructible. Thus,
Conjecture 7.5 holds for W .
7.6. Type E7 . Let W be of type E7 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
                     s1     s3    s4      s5    s6     s7
                      t      t      t      t     t      t
             E7
                                             t s2
In order to prove Conjecture 2.1, we argue as in (7.5). It remains to consider the
cuspidal families. By [23, 8.1], there is a unique cuspidal family F0 of Irr(W ), the
one containing the representation 512′a , where we use the notation of [23, 4.12] or
[14, Table C.5]. To deal with this family, we consider the parabolic subgroup WI of
type E6 . The possibilities for all non-zero vectors (mE )E∈F0 obtained by inducing
all constructible representations from WI are given by the following table:
                                E       fE     P1   P2   P3
                               512a      2     1    2    3
                               512′a     2     1    2    3
Now let Γ be a left cell belonging to F0 . Checking (♦), we find the following
possibilities for the expansion of [Γ]: 512a ⊕ 512′a, 2 · 512a or 2 · 512′a . The first
is constructible by the table in [22, p. 223]. We must show that the other two
possibilities do not occur. This can be seen as follows. By Theorem 4.1, the family
F0 corresponds to a two-sided cell c of W . Since fE = 2 for all E ∈ Irr(F0 ), we
consider the ring A2 as in Example 3.6. In fact, since we do not yet know if H is split
over the residue field of A2 (which is just F2 (v)), we work with a ring R ⊇ A2 as in
(3.10). It is readily checked that R is c-adapted. So Theorem 3.7 shows that ec =
φ−1
  R (tc ) is a primitive idempotent in the center of HR . Consider the decomposition
                LEFT CELLS AND CONSTRUCTIBLE REPRESENTATIONS                           29


matrix Dc of the block HR ec . That matrix has only two rows, corresponding to
512a and 512′a. The columns correspond to the projective indecomposable modules
in that block. Now we already know that 512a ⊕ 512′a is constructible and, hence, is
carried by some left cell contained in c. Hence 512a ⊕ 512′a gives one column of Dc ;
see Corollary 3.8. If [Γ] ∼
                          = 2 · 512a or 2 · 512′a , then this would give another column
                  ′ ∼
of Dc . Since 512a = 512a ⊗ sgn, we would conclude that actually both 2 · 512a and
2 · 512′a correspond to columns of Dc . Thus, we would deduce that Dc has at least
three columns and, hence, does not have full rank. Consequently, DR (which is a
block diagonal matrix where one block is given by Dc ) would not have full rank
either, contradicting (3.9)(2). This completes the proof of Conjecture 2.1 for W .

7.7. Type E8 . Let W be of type E8 , with generators and relations given by the
following diagram:
                    s1     s3    s4      s5    s6     s7     s8

In order to prove Conjecture 2.1, we argue as in (7.5). It remains to consider the
cuspidal families. By [23, 8.1], there is a unique cuspidal family F0 of Irr(W ), the
one containing the representation 4480y , where we use the notation of [23, 4.13] or
[14, Table C.6]. To deal with this family, we use the parabolic subgroup WI of type
E7 . The possibilities for all non-zero vectors (mE )E∈F0 cobtained by inducing all
30                                         MEINOLF GECK


constructible representations from WI are given by the columns labelled P1 , . . . , P8
in Table 2.
   Checking (♦) yields that P1 , . . . , P7 already give the expansion of a left cell
representation in terms of the irreducible ones; furthermore, the table in [22, p. 224]
shows that all these columns give constructible representations of W .
   Hence, it remains to consider the case where Γ is a left cell such that [Γ] is
a direct summand of the column labelled P8 in Table 2. We must show that the
vector (nE )E∈F0 giving the expansion of [Γ] is obtained by dividing all coefficients in
that column by 2. Now there are many more possibilities for (nE )E∈F0 satisfying
(♦). So we have to look for further arithmetical conditions on these numbers.
Another such condition is given by (4.12)(b), where we work over the ring A2 as in
Example 3.6. The remaining possibilities for the vector (nE )E∈F0 are listed in the
6 rightmost columns of Table 2. (The central characters in (4.12) can be computed
using the programs contained in the file hecbloc.g in the contributions directory
on the CHEVIE homepage [13].)
   Now we can argue as follows. Consider a ring R ⊇ A2 as in (3.10). Then, by
(3.9)(2), the columns of the decomposition matrix of HR are linearly independent.
Assume now, if possible, that [Γ] is given by one of the 6 rightmost columns in
Table 2. The HR -module [Γ]R is projective (see Corollary 3.8), hence it can be
written as a direct sum of projective indecomposable HR -modules. (Note that R
is not c-adapted, where c is the two-sided cell containing Γ; so we don’t know if
[Γ]R is indecomposable.) Now we already know that there is a left cell Γ7 whose
expansion in terms of irreducible representations is given by P7 , and [Γ7 ]R is a pro-
jective HR -module (Corollary 3.8). Since P8 = 2P7 , we conclude (using the linear
independence of the columns of the decomposition matrix of HR ) that [Γ]R must be
a sum of projective indecomposable HR -modules which occur in the decomposition
of [Γ7 ]R as a sum of projective indecomposable HR -modules. We don’t know that
decomposition of [Γ7 ]R but we can just compute all possible decompositions which
satisfy the conditions in (4.12)(b). It turns out that the possibilities are precisely
those given by the table with heading (S5 , S3 × S2 ) (p = 2) of Gyoja [17, p. 321].
Thus, at least one of the 6 rightmost columns in Table 2 should be expressible as a
sum of the columns in Gyoja’s table. One easily checks that this impossible. This
contradiction shows that Conjecture 2.1 holds for W .
