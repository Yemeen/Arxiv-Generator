Introduction Let G be simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over complex
numbers C. The universal central extension of G ⊗ C[t±1           ±1
                                                     1 , · · · , tn ] are called
toroidal Lie algebras. For n = 1 they are precisely the affine Kac-Moody
Lie-algebras so that toroidal Lie-algebras are generalisations of affine Kac-
Moody Lie-algebras. The major difference in the toroidal case is that the
centre is infinite dimensional unlike the affine case where the centre is one
dimensional. This poses a major difficulty in studying representation theory
of toroidal Lie algebras. The toroidal Lie-algebras are naturally Zn −graded
and there is an infinite dimensional centre with non-zero degree. Generally in
an irreducible representation the non-zero degree central operator does not
act as scalars but acts as a invertible central operators. The main purpose of
this paper is to prove that the study of irreducible representation for toroidal
Lie-algebra is reduced to the study of irreducible representation where the
infinite centre acts as scalars.
   We now give a more details of the paper. We fix an integer n ≥ 2. Let
An = C[t±1           ±1
        1 , · · · , tn ] be a Laurent polynomial in n commuting variables. We
consider the universal central extension of G ⊗ An and add degree derivations
D = {d1 , · · · , dn } which we call the toroidal Lie-algebra τ . (see section 1).
Let V be irreducible representation for the toroidal Lie-algebra with finite
dimensional weight spaces. We prove in section 1 that such a representation
is actually a representation for Gaff ⊗ An−1 up to an automorphism of τ (see
1.12).
   In the process we prove an important result which is independent interest.
Let τ be the quotient of τ by non-zero degree central elements. Then τ does
not admit representations with finite dimensional weight spaces where some
zero degree central operator acts non-trivially (Corollary (1.11)). See [BC],
[MJT] and [F] where representations for τ are studied.
   We prove in section 2 that the above irreducible representation admits
an irreducible quotient V1 for Gaff ⊗ An−1 ⊕ Cdn (Theorem (2.5)). Note that


                                        2
the quotient is only graded by dn which comes from the gradation of Gaff . In
this quotient the central operators act by scalars (Lemma (3.1)).
   In the last section we give a Gaff ⊗An−1 ⊕D module structure on V1 ⊗An−1
and prove complete reducibility in Proposition (3.8). In Theorem (3.9) we
prove that the original module V is isomorphic to a component of V1 ⊗ An−1 .
In fact all components are isomorphic up to a grade shift. Thus we conclude
that the study of irreducible representations for τ with finite dimensional
weight spaces is reduced to the study of irreducible representation for Gaff ⊗
An−1 ⊕ Cdn with finite dimensional weight spaces where the centre acts as
scalars.
   It may be appropriate to mention that irreducible integrable representa-
tions for τ with finite dimensional weight spaces are classified by the author
in [E3] and [E4]. See also [Y]. The integrable modules are not completely
reducible. Indecomposable modules which are not necessarily irreducible has
been studied by [CT]. Further vertex representations are constructed and
studied in [MEY], [EM], [E1], [JMT] and [CO].

Section 1 Let G be simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over complex
numbers C. Let (,) be G-invariant non-degenerate symmetric billinear form.
Fix a positive integer n ≥ 2. Let A = An = C[t±1           ±1
                                              1 , · · · , tn ] be a Laurent
polynomial ring in n commuting variables. For m = (m1 , · · · , mn ) ∈ Zn ,
let tm = tm        mn
          1 · · · tn
           1
                      ∈ A. For any vector space V , let VA = V ⊗ A. Let
v(m) = v ⊗ tm . Let Z = ΩA /dA be the module of differentials. That is Z is
spanned by vectors tm Ki , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, m ∈ Zn with a relation.

               mi tm Ki = 0.

   Let τ = G ⊗ A ⊕ Z ⊕ D where D is spanned by d1 , · · · , dn . We will now
define a Lie algebra structure on τ .

Proposition (3.1) ([MY], [K]). G ⊗A⊕Z is the universal central extension
of G ⊗ A.

(1.4) Let h be a Cartan subalgebra of G. Let h̃ be the span of h, K1 , · · · Kn
and d1 , · · · , dn . We call h̃ a Cartan subalgebra of τ . Let δ1 , · · · , δn be in h̃∗
defined by δi (h) = 0, δi (Kj ) = 0 and δi (dj ) = δij . For r ∈ Zn , δr =

                          τ0       = h̃

Then clearly τ = ⊕α∈△ τα is a root space decomposition of τ .

(1.5) Let G = GL(n, Z) be the set of n × n matrices with entries in Z
whose determinant is ±1. For every B in G we define an automorphism of τ
again denoted by B. Let r, s ∈ Zn and let mT = Br T and nT = BsT . Define

                                BX(r) = X(m), X ∈ G

                                   Bd(tr )ts = d(tm )tn

Let (d11 , · · · , d1n )T = A−1 (d1 , · · · dn )T . Define Bdi = d1i . It is easy to check
that B is an automorphism of τ .

                                              4
(1.6) We recall some simple results from [E4].
     Let V be irreducible weight module for τ with finite dimensional weight
spaces with respect to h̃. the following is proved in [E4].

Lemma (1.7) (Lemma (4.3) and (4.4) of [E4]). Let z be in Z of degree m.
     (1)   Suppose zv 6= 0 for some v in V . Then zv 6= 0 for all non-zero v in
V.
     (2)    Suppose z 6= 0. Then there exists a central operator T on V such
that zT = T z = Id.
     Let L = {r, −r | tr Ki 6= 0 on V for some i}.
     Let T be the Z linear span of L. Clearly T is a subgroup of Zn . Let k be
the rank of T . Clearly k is invariant under the automorphism defined above.
Now by standard basis theorem there exists a Z basis m1 , · · · , mn of Zn such
that k1 m1 , · · · , kk mk is a basis of T for some non-zero integers k1 , · · · kk . It is
a standard fact that there exists a B in G such that Bmi = (0, · · · 1, 0 · · · 0)
(1 in the ith place). Thus up to automorphism, we can assume that there
exists non-zero central operator z1 , · · · zk on V such that their degree are
(k1 , 0 · · · 0) · · · (0, · · · kk , 0 · · · 0). We have the following:

Proposition 1.8                  (Theorem (4.5) of [E4]). Let V be irreducible module
for τ with finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to h̃. Then up to
automorphism the following is true on V .

  (1) There exists non-zero central operators z1 , · · · , zk of degree
       (k1 , 0 · · · 0) · · · (0 · · · kk , 0 · · · 0).

  (2) k < n

  (3) tr Ki = 0 for all i and for all r such that for some j, k+1 ≤ j ≤ n, rj 6= 0.

  (4) tr Ki = 0 1 ≤ i ≤ k, ∀r ∈ Zn .


                                                          5
  (5) There exists a proper submodule W of G ⊗ A ⊕ Z ⊕ Dk (where Dk is
        spanned by dk+1 , · · · dn ) such that V /W has finite dimensional weight
                                       P
        spaces with respect to h ⊕ CKi ⊕ Dk .

Theorem (1.9) Let V be an irreducible τ -module with finite dimensional
weight spaces with respect to h̃. Let k be as defined above. Suppose some
central operator is non-zero. Then k = n − 1.
     Before we prove the theorem, we prove an important proposition which
is also of independent interest.
     Let H be a finite dimensional vector space over C with a non-degenerate
billinear form <, >. Consider the Lie-algebra H̃ = H ⊗ C[t±1   ±1
                                                          1 , t2 ] ⊕ CC1 ⊕
CC2 ⊕ Cd1 ⊕ Cd2 with the following Lie bracket

  (1) [h1 ⊗ tr11 tr22 , h2 ⊗ ts11 ts22 ] = (h1 , h2 )δr1 +s1 ,0 δr2 +s2 ,0 (r1 C1 + r2 C2 ).

  (2) C1 , C2 are central

  (3) [di , h1 tr11 tr22 ] = ri h1 tr11 tr22 , [di , dj ] = 0.

     Let h = H ⊕ CC1 ⊕ CC2 ⊕ Cd1 ⊕ Cd2 .

Proposition (1.10) Let W be a h-weight module for H̃ with finite dimen-
sional weight spaces. Suppose, at least on Ci acts non trivially. Then such a
W does not exists.

Proof The proof is inspired by Futorny’s work [F].
     First note that GL(2, Z) acts on H̃ as automorphism. Now twisting by
automorphism we can assume that both central elements act non trivially on
W.
     Let W = ⊕n∈Z2 Wn be the weight space decomposition. Let htr11 tr22 =
h ⊗ tr11 tr22 .


                                                       6
   Choose h ∈ H such that (h, h) = 1. Let e = ht1 ht−1              −1
                                                    1 and f = ht2 ht2 .
Then e and f leaves each finite dimensional space Wn invariant.
   Fix n ∈ Z2 such that Wn 6= 0. Let v be in Wn such that, v is a common
eigen vector for e and f . Let v be a submodule of W generated by v. Let Vm =
V ∩ Wm . We call a vector of the form h1 tr111 tr221 · · · hn tr1n1 tr2n2 v a monomial.
Note that each monomial is a eigen vector for e and f . Conversely any eigen
vector of e or f is a linear combination of monomials with same eigenvalue.
From Futorny’s work (Lemma (4.2) of [F]) it follows that the eigen values of
e and f are of the form m1 C1 and m2 C2 for some mi ∈ Z. Choose a eigen
vector w in Vn of eigenvalue m2 C2 for f such that the absolute value of m2
is maximal.
   Suppose m2 > 0. From the above observations we can assume w is a
monomial. Suppose ew = mw.

Claim 1 Suppose m > 0. Then htℓ1 tk2 w = 0 for all k ≥ 2 and for all
ℓ > 0. Suppose htℓ1 tk2 w 6= 0 for some k ≥ 2 and for some ℓ > 0. Con-
sider ht2 ht−1  ℓ k              ℓ k
            2 ht1 t2 w = m2 C2 ht1 t2 w. We are using the fact that k ≥ 2
so that f commutes with htℓ1 tk2 . This proves that ht−1  ℓ k
                                                      2 ht1 t2 w 6= 0. Let
ws = (ht−1 s ℓ k
        2 ) ht1 t2 w. We prove by induction on s that ws 6= 0. Consider
ht2 ws+1 = f ws = (s + m2 )ws . By induction ws 6= 0 and we know s + m2 > 0.
This proves ws+1 6= 0. In particular wk 6= 0.

Sub-claim (ht−1 ℓ                        −1
             1 ) wk 6= 0. Consider ht1 ht1 wk = mwk . Since m 6= 0, this
proves ht−1                          −1 s
         1 wk 6= 0. Consider vs = (ht1 ) wk . We prove by induction on s
that vs 6= 0. Consider ht1 vs+1 = evs = (s+m)vs . By induction vs 6= 0 and we
know that s+m > 0. This proves vs+1 6= 0. In particular vℓ = (ht−1 ℓ
                                                                1 ) wk 6= 0.
But f vℓ = (k + m2 )vℓ , vℓ ∈ Vn . This is a contradiction to the maximality of
m2 . This proves the claim 1.




                                          7
Claim 2. suppose m ≤ 0. Then htℓ1 tk2 w = 0 for all k ≥ 2 and for all ℓ < 0.
Consider ht1−1 ht1 w = ht1 · ht−1
                               1 w − C1 w


                                = (m − 1)C1 w

.
    Note that m − 1 < 0. By arguing as in the claim 1 we prove that

                              (ht−1 k ℓ k
                                 2 ) ht1 t2 w 6= 0.


Now we claim that

                        b = (ht1 )−ℓ (ht−1 k ℓ k
                                        2 ) ht1 t2 w 6= 0.


This can be established by arguing as in the claim 1. Now using ht−1
                                                                  1 ht1 in-
stead of ht1 ht−1
               1 , noting m−1 < 0. Now f b = (m2 + k)b. It is a contradiction
to the maximality to m2 .

Claim 3 htℓ1 t−k
              2 w 6= 0 for all k ≥ 2 and for all ℓ > 0 or for all ℓ < 0 such
that ℓC1 ± kC2 6= 0. This follows from claim 1 and 2 by applying ht−ℓ k
                                                                   1 t2 on

the above vector.

Case 1 Assume htℓ1 t−k
                    2 w 6= 0 for all k ≥ 2 and all ℓ ≥ 1. Suppose
ht−ℓ −k
  1 t2 w 6= 0 for some k ≥ 2 and for all ℓ > 0 such that ℓC + 1 ± kC2 6= 0.
Then we claim that

                      {ht−ℓ −k ℓ −k
                         1 t2 ht1 t2 w, ℓC1 ± kC2 6= 0}


is linearly independent. Suppose the claim is true. Then Vn+(0,2k) is infinite
dimension a contradiction. This prove the proposition.
    Suppose
                         X
                             aℓi ht1−ℓi t−k  ℓi −k
                                         2 ht1 t2 w = 0.



                                        8
Apply ht1−ℓ1 tk2 to the above sum. It commutes with the first term. Thus we
get
                             aℓ1 ht1−ℓ1 t−k
                                         2 (ℓC1 − kC2 )w.

This forces from our assumptions that aℓ1 = 0. Similarly aℓi = 0. Thus the
above set is linearly independent. Now suppose ht−ℓ −k
                                                 1 t2 w = 0 for all k ≥ 2

and for some ℓ > 0 ∋ ℓC1 ± kC2 6= 0. Then it follows that htℓ1 tk2 w 6= 0. Now
consider the set
                          {htℓ1 tk2 htℓ1 t−k
                                          2 w, ℓC1 ± kC2 6= 0}

which can be shown to be linearly independent.
      This contradicts the finite dimensionality of the weight space.

Case 2 htℓ1 t−k
             2 w 6= 0 for all k ≥ 2 and for all ℓ < 0. This case can be dealt
with as in the Case 1.
      We are now left with the case m2 ≤ 0. Consider

                           ht−1              −1
                             2 ht2 w = ht2 ht2 w − C2 w


                                  = (m2 − 1)C2 w.
Now we have m2 − 1 < 0. Now the above proof works with ht−1
                                                         2 ht2 instead
of ht2 ht−1
         2 .                                                                   [QED]
                                                                      P        P
We first deduce an interesting corollary. Let τ = G ⊗ A ⊕                 CKi ⊕ Cdi
be a Lie-algebra defined by
                                                                  X
               [X(r), Y (s)] = [X, Y ](r + s) + (X, Y )δr+s,0         r i Ki

Ki are central.
                         [di , X(r)] = ri X(r), [di , dj ] = 0.

Corollary (1.11) Let V be a weight module for τ , n ≥ 2 generated by a
weight vector with finite dimensional weight spaces. Assume at least one Ki
acts non trivially on the generator. Then such a V does not exist.

sition (1.8) (4).        Let us say i = k + 1.                   Then k + 2 ≤ n.             Consider

0 unless r1 + r2 = 0 and s1 + s2 = 0 from Proposition (1.8) (3). Now by
restriction the module to the above sub algebra, we get a contradiction to
Proposition (1.10).

Case 2 Assume tm Ki is non zero on V . Then by Proposition (1.8) (3),
i ≥ k + 1. Further mk+1 = 0 · · · = mn . Let us say i = k + 1. Consider the
subalgebra generated by
(1) htm trk tsk+1 , s > 0 or s = 0 but r > 0,
(2) htrk tsk+1 , s < 0 or s = 0, r < 0
(3) htm .
    Consider in the above sub algebra,

                                    [h1 tm trk1 tsk+1
                                                   1
                                                      , h2 trk2 tsk+1
                                                                   2
                                                                      ]

                   = (h1 , h2 )δr1 +s1 ,0 δr2 +s2 ,0 (r1 tm Kk+1 + r2 tm Kk+2 ).

All other brackets of the above sub algebra are zero. This is due to the
Proposition (1.8). It is easy to see that the above sub algebra is isomorphic
to H̃ defined earlier to Proposition (1.10). By abuse of notation we call the
above sub algebra H̃. Now we can not appeal to Proposition (1.10) as the
central operator tm Kk+1 has a non zero degree. But now by Proposition
(1.8) (5), there exists a proper submodule W for G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA ⊕ Dk such

                                                   10
                                                                   P
that V /W has finite dimensional weight space for h ⊕                  CKi ⊕ Dk . Now in
this new module the central operator tm Ki has zero degree and leaves finite
dimensional weight space invariant. We now claim that tm Kk+1 is non zero
on V /W . Suppose it is zero. Then tm Kk+1 V ⊆ W . But V = tm Kk+1 V ⊆ W
a contradiction as W is proper. Thus the H̃ module generated by any tm Kk+1
invariant vector in V /W has all the properties of the Proposition 1.10. So
such a module does not exist. This proves k = n − 1.

(1.12)     Let V be an irreducible τ -module with finite dimensional weight
spaces. After twisting the module by an automorphism we can assume that
the following central operators are zero.
                         tm Ki = 0       1≤i≤n−1

It is easy to check that ϕ defines a Lie algebra homomorphism. ¿From
the above observation it follows that on an irreducible module for τ with
finite dimensional weight spaces, the Ker ϕ vanishes after twisting by an
automorphism.
   Thus we can assume V is actually a module for Gaff ⊗ An−1 ⊕ D. Thus
we study only such module.

                                        11
Section 2.
(2.1) We will first introduce some notation
                                                            ±1         ±1
    Let J = Gaff ⊗ An−1 where Gaff = G ⊗ C[t±1
                                            n ] and An = C[t1 , · · · tn−1 ].
Let Dk be the linear span of dk+1, · · · dn . Let hk = h ⊕ Ckn ⊕ Dk so that
hk−1 = hk ⊕ Cdk and h0 = h ⊕ Ckn ⊕ D.
    We start with an irreducible J ⊕ D-module V with finite dimensional
weight spaces with respect to h0 . We further assume that there exists non-
zero central operators z1 , · · · , zn−1 with degree (k1 , 0 · · · 0), · · · (0, · · · 0, kn−1 , 0)
without loss of generality we can assume that each ki is a positive integer.
Our aim is this section is to prove that a maximal J ⊕ Cdn -sub module W1
exists such that V /W1 is an irreducible J ⊕dn - module with finite dimensional
weight spaces with respect to hn−1 .
    We will first produce an irreducible quotient of V for the Lie-algebra
J ⊕ D1 with finite dimensional weight space with respect to h1 .

(2.2)       First notice that {z1 v − v | v ∈ V } is a J ⊕ D1 proper submodule
of V . Thus V is reducible as J ⊕ D1 -module. So let W be a non-zero proper
J ⊕ D1 submodule of V . Let µ be a weight of V with respect to h0 . Let
µ = µ | h1 . Let w ∈ W be any µ−weight vector.
               X
   Let w =          wi , wi ∈ Vµ+ki δi where k1 < k2 < · · · < km . Note that
                1≤i≤m
m ≥ 2 as W can not contain h0 -weight vectors. If it contains then it will
not be proper. Define d(W ) = kℓ − k1 . A vector w in W is called minimal if
d(W ) is minimal for all the µ-weight vector. Now one can prove, that d(W )
depends on W but not on w. The proof is same as given in Lemma (3.8)
of [E2]. (In the proof of the Lemma one has to assume kn − k1 + ℓ1 ≤ ℓm
to conclude d(Xw − v) < ℓm − ℓ1 . The rest of the proofs works as it is ).
As in the proof of Lemma (3.9) of [E2], we can prove that V /W has finite
dimensional weight space for h1 . We can further prove, as in Proposition


                                               12
(3.11) of [E2]. V has a maximal J ⊕ D1 -submodule so that the quotient is
irreducible. Thus we have proved the following:

(2.3) Proposition Let V be as defined in 2.1. Then there exists a maximal
J ⊕ D1 submodule W1 of V such that V /W is irreducible and has finite
dimensional weight spaces with respect to h1 .

(2.4) Let V /W1 as above. Consider {z2 v − v | v ∈ V /W1 }. This is a
J ⊕ D2 non-zero submodule of V /W1 and vectors are not d2 invariant. But
V /W1 contains d2 -invariant vector. Thus {Z2 v − v | v ∈ V /W1 } is a non-zero
proper submodule of V /W1 . In particular V /W1 is J ⊕ D2 reducible. Now by
repeating the above process. We get an irreducible quotient of V /W1 which
J ⊕ D2 - module with finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to h2 . By
repeating the process n − 1 times we have the following theorem.

(2.5) Theorem Let V be as defined in (2.1). Then there exists a maximal
J ⊕ Dn−1 submodule W of V so that V /W is an irreducible J ⊕ Dn−1 -module
and has finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to hn−1 . Further we
can choose W such that W contains {zi v − v | v ∈ V, i = 1, · · · n − 1}.


Section 3
Let V be irreducible J ⊕ D-module with finite dimensional weight spaces
with respect to h0 . Assume that there exists non-zero central operators
z1 , z2 , · · · , zn−1 of degree k 1 = (k1 , 0 · · · 0) · · · kn−1 = (0, · · · (0, · · · kn−1 , 0).
Let W be a maximal J ⊕ Dn−1 submodule of V so that V /W is irreducible
J ⊕ Dn−1 -module with finite dimensional weight space with respect to hn−1 .
Let V1 = V /W .




                                                13
(3.1) Lemma Each z in Z acts as scalar on V1 . Further each z in Z which
acts as non-zero on V acts as non-zero scale on V1 .

Proof First note that for any z that acts non trivially on V is of degree
(∗, · · · ∗, 0). Such a z leaves each finite dimensional weight space of V1 invari-
ant. Thus z has a eigen vector with eigen value ℓ. Since V1 is irreducible
z acts by the same scalar on the full module V1 . Suppose z is non-zero on
V . Then we claim ℓ 6= 0. Suppose ℓ = 0 then it follows that zV ⊆ W . But
V = zV ⊆ W which contradicts the fact that W is proper. So ℓ 6= 0. This
proves the Lemma.

(3.2) Let V1 be as above. We now define J ⊕ D module structure on
V1 ⊗ An−1 . Recall J = Gaff ⊗ An−1 . Let m = (m1 , · · · mn−1 ) ∈ Zn−1 . Let
                                               m
X(m) = X ⊗ tm , X ∈ Gaff , tm = tm         n−1
                                 1 · · · tn−1
                                  1
                                               ∈ An−1 . Define a module
structure π(α) on V1 ⊗ An−1 where α = (α1 , · · · αn−1 ) ∈ Cn−1 .

              π(α) · X(m)v(n) = (X(m)v)(m + n)
              dn v(n)             = (dn v)(n)
              di v(n)             = (αi + ni )v(n), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1

The aim of this section is to prove that (V1 ⊗ An−1 , π(α)) is completely
reducible and V is isomorphic to some component of V1 ⊗ An−1 for a suitable
α. First consider the J ⊕ Dn−1 map S from V1 ⊗ An−1 → V1 given by

                                  S(v(n)) = v.

(3.3) Lemma Let W be any non-zero J ⊕ D-submodule of V1 ⊗ An−1 .
(1)   S(W ) = V1
(2) If λ is a weight of V1 then λ + δm is a weight of W for some m.




                                        14
Proof Since V1 is irreducible, it is sufficient to prove that S(W ) is non-zero.
But W is h0 weight module and hence contains vectors of the form v(m).
Then S(v(m) = v 6= 0.
   (2) Let w ∈ V1 be a weight vector of weight λ. Then there exists v ∈ W
                                     P
such that S(w) = v. Now write w =       wm . Since w is a weight module it
follows that wm ∈ W . Thus (2) follows.

(3.4) Suppose zi acts by ℓi on V1 and we know that ℓi 6= 0.
   Consider zi v(m) = ℓi v(m + k i ). Clearly zi is central operator and invert-
ible on V1 ⊗ An−1 . Let

                    Γ = k1 Z ⊕ k2 Z ⊕ · · · ⊕ kn−1 Z ⊆ Zn−1 .

It is easy to see that for each m ∈ Γ there exists a central operator zm on
V1 ⊗ An−1 which is invertible.
   Let W be a submodule of V1 ⊗ An−1 .
   We claim then dim Wλ = dim Wλ + δm for all m ∈ Γ. Note that zm Wλ ⊆
Wλ+δm and equality holds as zm is invertible. Thus the claim follows. let λ
                                      X
be a fixed weight of V1 . Let K(W ) =         dim (Wλ+δm ).
                                        0≤mi <ki
   Now from Lemma 3.3 (2) and the above claim it follows that K(W ) 6= 0.

(3.5) Proposition V1 ⊗ An−1 contains an irreducible submodule.

Proof We will prove that for any non-zero submodule W of V1 ⊗ An−1
either W contains an irreducible submodule or W contains a module W1 ∋
K(W1 ) < K(W ). Fix a non-zero submodule W of V1 ⊗ An−1 . Consider
S = ⊕m∈Zn−1 Wλ+δm . Let W̃ be a submodule of W generated by S. Then
clearly K(W̃ ) = K(W ). Suppose W̃ has a proper submodule W1 .




                                       15
Claim K(W1 ) < K(W̃ ). Suppose the claim is false. Consider

(∗)                 W1 ∩ (V1 ⊗ An−1 )λ+δm ⊆ W̃ ∩ (V1 ⊗ An−1 )λ+δm .

Now K(W1 ) = K(W̃ ) implies that equality holds for all m ∋ 0 ≤ mi < ki .
Now by the claim in (3.4) it follows that equally holds in * for all m in
Zn−1 . This proves W1 contain S and hence contain W̃ . This contradicts
the fact that W1 is proper in W̃ . Hence the claim. Now by repeating the
above process we get an irreducible submodule of V1 ⊗ An−1 . We now prove
complete reducibility of V1 ⊗ An−1 .

(3.6)       Let W be an irreducible submodule of V1 ⊗ An−1 . We have fixed
a weight λ of V1 . By Lemma 3.3 (b) there exists a weight vector v in V of
weight λ such that v(r) ∈ W .
      Let U be the universal enveloping algebra of J ⊕ D. Write

                                   U = ⊗m∈Zn−1 U m

                     U m = {X ∈ U | [di , X] = ri X, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}

Clearly Uv(r) = W where Uv(r) is the J ⊕ D-module generated by v(r)

(3.7)     Lemma (1) Uv(s) is irreducible J ⊕ D-module for any s ∈ Zn−1 .
          X
      (2)     U v(s) = V1 ⊗ An−1 .
         0≤si <ki


Proof Consider the map ϕ : U v(r) → Uv(s) given by ϕ(w(k)) = w(k +
s − r). It is a J ⊕ Dn−1 module map. But need not be J ⊕ D- module map.
Nevertheless it is an isomorphism. It is easy to see that U v(s) is irreducible.

             X
Claim               U v(s) = V1 ⊗ An−1 . Let w(s) ∈ V1 ⊗ An−1 , w ∈ V1 . Since V1 is
           s∈Zn−1
                                                             P
irreducible there exists X ∈ U ∋ Xv = w. Write X =               Xr where Xr ∈ U r .

                                           16
   Consider
                   X                      X
                       Xr · v(s − r) =          (Xr v)(s) = w(s).

This proves the claim. Now recall that there exists a non-zero central oper-
ator zm for any m ∈ Γ. Further zm is invertible.
   Thus zm U v(r) = U(r + m). From this it follows that
                           X                   X
                                   U v(s) =              Uv(s).
                          s∈Zn−1              0≤si <ki


(3.8) Proposition V1 ⊗ An−1 is completely reducible as J ⊕ D-module.

                                          X
Proof We have already seen that                     Uv(s) = V1 ⊗ An−1 . The sum is
                                         0≤si <ki
                                                                  X
finite. Let T = {s | 0 ≤ si < ki }. Suppose U v(s) ∩                    U v(s) 6= 0. Since
                                                                  r∈T
                                                      r6=s
                                             X
Uv(s) is irreducible it follows that Uv(s) ⊆  U v(r). Thus we have reduced
                                                    r∈T
                                                    s6=r                      P
the finite sum by 1. Repeating this process we can replace the                    by direct
sum with fewer terms.
   Let U = ⊕η∈h∗0 U η , U η = {X ∈ U | [h, X] = η(h)X∀h ∈ h0 }. Let U be the
universal enveloping algebra of J ⊕ Dn . Let U = ⊕η∈hη∈h∗ Uη , Uη = {X ∈
                                                                        n−1

U | [h, X] = η(h)X ∀ ∈ hn1 }

(3.9) Theorem V is isomorphic to a component of V1 ⊗ An−1 as J ⊕ D-
module.

Proof It can be proved similar to the techniques of 3.13, 3.14, 3.15 and
3.16 of [E2]. The U and U is taken as defined by us. The d in [E2] is taken as
the space spanned by d1 , · · · dn−1 . We do not need the condition (2.2) of [E2].
In stead we have non-zero central operators z1 , · · · , zn−1 which are invertible
in V as well as V1 ⊗ An−1 .

(3.10) Remark The study of irreducible τ -modules with finite dimensional
weight space where some part of the center acts non-trivially is now reduced
to the study of irreducible modules of J ⊕ Dn with finite dimensional weight
spaces. The advantage of the later modules is that the infinite dimensional
center acts as scalars.
