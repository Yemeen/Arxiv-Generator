                                                                                        Abstract
                                                      We study the properties of tilting modules in the context of properly stratified
                                                  algebras. In particular, we answer the question when the Ringel dual of a properly
                                                  stratified algebra is properly stratified itself, and show that the class of properly
                                                  stratified algebras for which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules coincide
                                                  is closed under taking the Ringel dual. Studying stratified algebras, whose Ringel
                                                  dual is properly stratified, we discover a new Ringel-type duality for such algebras,
                                                  which we call the two-step duality. This duality arises from the existence of a new
                                                  (generalized) tilting module for stratified algebras with properly stratified Ringel
                                                  dual. We show that this new tilting module has a lot of interesting properties, for
                                                  instance, its projective dimension equals the projectively defined finitistic dimension
                                                  of the original algebra, it guarantees that the category of modules of finite projective
                                                  dimension is contravariantly finite, and, finally, it allows one to compute the fini-
                                                  tistic dimension of the original algebra in terms of the projective dimension of the
                                                  characteristic tilting module.


                                             1    Introduction
                                             The concept of Ringel duality for quasi-hereditary algebras, introduced in [Ri], has been
                                             shown to be a very important and useful tool for the study of different situations in which
                                             quasi-hereditary algebras arise in a natural way, for example, for the study of the cate-
                                             gory O, Schur algebras and algebraic groups. The list of natural generalizations of quasi-
                                             hereditary algebras starts with the so-called standardly stratified algebras, introduced in
                                             [CPS2], and the so-called properly stratified algebras, introduced in [Dl]. The study of
                                             the Ringel duality for stratified algebras was originated in [AHLU1], where the results,
                                             analogous to those of Ringel, were obtained. Alternative approach to the study of tilting
                                             modules for stratified algebras was developed in [PR, Xi].
                                                 The class of properly stratified algebras is a proper subclass of the class of standardly
                                             stratified algebras. In particular, the results of [AHLU1] perfectly apply to properly strati-
                                             fied algebras. However, the very definition of the properly stratified algebras suggests that
                                             such algebras must posses much more symmetric properties, for example, because of the
                                             left-right symmetry of the class of such algebras. The principle motivation for the present
                                             paper was the question whether one can obtain any nice new properties for the Ringel
                                             duals of properly stratified algebras.

                                                                                             1
    Our first (relatively unexpected) observation is that the Ringel dual of a properly
stratified algebra does not have to be properly stratified, see the example in Subsection 9.2.
This leads to the following natural question: when the Ringel dual of a stratified algebra
is properly stratified? We answer this question in Section 3 in terms of the existence of
special filtrations on tilting modules. In Section 4 we show that a natural class of properly
stratified algebras is closed with respect to taking of the Ringel dual. This is the class
of properly stratified algebras for which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules
coincide. This class appears naturally in [MO] during the study of the finitistic dimension
of stratified algebras and contains, in particular, all quasi-hereditary algebras.
    Assume now that A is a stratified algebra, whose Ringel dual R is properly stratified.
As a properly stratified algebra, the algebra R has both tilting and cotilting modules. The
classical Ringel duality identifies the characteristic cotilting R-module with the injective
cogenerator of A−mod, whereas the characteristic tilting R-module is identified with a
possibly different A-module, which we call H. It happens that this module H carries a
lot of very important information about the algebra A and the major part of our paper is
devoted to the study of the properties of H. In particular, in Sections 5 and 6 we obtain
the following:
 (i) the module H is a (generalized) tilting module;

 (ii) the module H is relatively injective with respect to the subcategory of A-modules of
      finite projective dimension;

(iii) the projective dimension of H equals the finitistic dimension of A;

(iv) existence of H guarantees that the category of A-modules of finite projective dimen-
     sion is contravariantly finite in A−mod;

 (v) if the algebra A has a simple preserving duality, then the existence of H guaran-
     tees that the finitistic dimension of A equals twice the projective dimension of the
     characteristic tilting R-module.
    The classical tilting theory (see for example [Ha]) motivates the study of the endomor-
phism algebra of a (generalized) tilting module, whenever one has such a module. Hence in
Section 8 we consider the opposite of the endomorphism algebra B of the module H. We
show that this algebra is standardly stratified and that its Ringel dual is properly strati-
fied. This allows us to consider the corresponding module H (B) . It happens that H (B) can
be naturally identified with the injective cogenerator for Aopp −mod, which leads to a new
covariant Ringel-type duality for stratified algebras having properly stratified Ringel dual.
    We show that this duality induces an equivalence between the category of all A-modules
of finite projective dimension and the category of all B-modules of finite injective dimen-
sion. It is not surprising that this duality was not discovered in the theory of quasi-
hereditary algebras for in that case, and, more generally, in the case of properly stratified
algebras for which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules coincide, it degenerates
to the identity functor. In particular, in such case we always have B = A.

                                              2
   We finish the paper with various examples illustrating the new duality, which include,
in particular, certain categories of Harish-Chandra bimodules over complex semi-simple
Lie algebras, and tensor products of quasi-hereditary and local algebras.


2     Notation
2.1    General conventions
Let A be a finite dimensional associative algebra with identity over a field k. For simplic-
ity we assume that k is algebraically closed. However, slightly modifying the dimension
arguments, one easily extends all the results to the case of an arbitrary field. Denote by Λ
an index set for the isomorphism classes of simple A-modules, which we denote by L(λ),
λ ∈ Λ. We write P (λ) for the projective cover and I(λ) for the injective hull of L(λ).
    Throughout the paper a module means a left module. Our main object will be some
associative algebra A (satisfying certain conditions, which we will specify later). Since we
will consider more than one algebra, to avoid confusion we adopt the following convention:
A-modules will be written without any additional notation, for example M; modules over
any other algebra, B say, will be written as M (B) or B M. By A−mod we denote the
category of all finite-dimensional left A-modules.
    Let C be a subclass of objects from A−mod. Define F (C) as the full subcategory
of A−mod, which consists of all modules M having a filtration, whose subquotients are
isomorphic to modules from C. Given an A-module, M, we define add(M) to be the full
subcategory of A−mod containing all modules, which are isomorphic to direct summands
of M k for some k ≥ 0. Let M and N be two A-modules. We define the trace TrM (N) of
M in N as the sum of images of all A-homomorphisms from M to N.
    We denote by D the usual duality functor D(− ) = Homk (− , k). Recall also that an
algebra, A, has a simple preserving duality if there exists an exact contravariant and
involutive equivalence ◦ : A-mod → A-mod, which preserves the isomorphism classes of
simple A-modules.
    For an algebra, A, we denote by P(A)<∞ the full subcategory of A-mod, consisting
of all A-modules of finite projective dimension; and by I(A)<∞ the full subcategory of
A-mod, consisting of all A-modules of finite injective dimension. We also denote by D(A)
the derived category of A−mod, by D b (A) its full subcategory consisting of all bounded
complexes, and by D − (A) its full subcategory consisting of all right bounded complexes.
By K(A-mod) we denote the homotopy category of the category of all complexes of A-
modules, by Kb (A-mod) its full subcategory consisting of all bounded complexes, and by
K− (A-mod) its full subcategory consisting of all right bounded complexes.
    Let X • be a complex in K(A-mod) and j ∈ Z. We define the truncated complex tj X •
to be the complex
                                          dj−2      dj−1
                  tj X • :    · · · → Xj−2 −→ Xj−1 −→ Xj → 0 → 0 . . . ,

where we keep the differentials di , i < j. A complex, X • = {Xi : i ∈ Z}, is called positive

                                             3
or negative provided that Xi = 0 for all i < 0 or i > 0 respectively. For an A-module, M,
we denote by M • the corresponding complex in Kb (A-mod), concentrated in degree zero.

2.2    Stratified algebras and quasi-hereditary algebras
Let ≤ be a linear order on Λ. For λ, µ ∈ Λ we will write λ < µ provided that λ ≤ µ and
λ 6= µ. For λ ∈ Λ set P >λ = ⊕µ>λ P (µ) and I >λ = ⊕µ>λ I(µ). For each λ ∈ Λ we define
the standard module
                              ∆(λ) = P (λ)/ TrP >λ (P (λ)),
and the proper standard module

                                 ∆(λ) = ∆(λ)/P f Imf ,
                                                   
where the sum is taken over all f ∈ rad EndA ∆(λ) . Dually, we define the costandard
module                                    \
                                ∇(λ) =          Kerf,
                                           f :I(λ)→I >λ

and the proper costandard module
                                               \
                                      ∇(λ) =           Kerf,
                                                   f
                                                                              
where the intersection is taken over all homomorphisms f ∈ rad EndA ∇(λ) .
   We can now define different classes of algebras which we will consider in this paper.
The pair (A, ≤) is called a strongly standardly stratified algebra or simply an SSS-algebra
if
(SS) the kernel of the canonical epimorphism P (λ) ։ ∆(λ) has a filtration, whose sub-
     quotients are ∆(µ) with λ < µ.
In several papers, see for example [AHLU1, ADL2], the authors used the name standardly
stratified algebras for the algebras defined above. This gives rise to a confusion with a more
general original definition from [CPS2], where standardly stratified algebras were defined
with respect to a partial pre-order on Λ. Since in the present paper we will work with
linear orders, we decided to use a different name.
    The SSS-algebra (A, ≤) is said to be properly stratified (see [Dl]) if the following con-
dition is satisfied:
(PS) for each λ ∈ Λ the module ∆(λ) has a filtration, whose subquotients are isomorphic
     to ∆(λ).
Since the order ≤ will be fixed throughout the paper, we will usually omit it in the notation.
It is easy to see (consult [Dl]) that an SSS-algebra, A, is properly stratified if and only
if Aopp is an SSS-algebra as well (with respect to the same order ≤). In particular, the
algebra A is properly stratified if and only if Aopp is.

                                               4
    The smallest class of algebras we will treat is the class of quasi-hereditary algebras,
defined in the following way: the SSS-algebra (A, ≤) is called quasi-hereditary (see [CPS1])
if the following condition is satisfied:

(QH) for each λ ∈ Λ we have ∆(λ) = ∆(λ).

    If A is standardly (properly) stratified then we denote by F (∆) the category F (C),
where C = {∆(λ)|λ ∈ Λ}, and define F (∆), F (∇) and F (∇) similarly.
    Let A be an SSS-algebra. It was shown in [AHLU1] that the category F (∆) ∩ F (∇) is
closed under taking direct summands, and that the indecomposable modules in this cate-
gory are indexed by λ ∈ Λ in a natural way. The objects of F (∆) ∩ F (∇) are called tilting
modules. For λ ∈ Λ we denote by T (λ) the (unique up to isomorphism) indecomposable
object in F (∆) ∩ F (∇) for which there exists an exact sequence,

                             0 → ∆(λ) → T (λ) → Coker → 0,

such that Coker ∈ F (∆) (see [AHLU1, Lemma 2.5]). For T = ⊕λ∈Λ T (λ) we have F (∆) ∩
F (∇) = add(T ). The module T is usually called the characteristic tilting module.
    It also follows from [AHLU1] that, in the case when A is properly stratified, the category
F (∆) ∩ F (∇) is closed under taking direct summands, and that the indecomposable mod-
ules in this category are indexed by λ ∈ Λ in a natural way. The objects of F (∆) ∩ F (∇)
are called cotilting modules. For λ ∈ Λ we denote by C(λ) the (unique up to isomorphism)
indecomposable object in F (∆) ∩ F (∇) for which there exists an exact sequence,

                              0 → Ker → C(λ) → ∇(λ) → 0,

such that Ker ∈ F (∇). For C = ⊕λ∈Λ C(λ) we have F (∆) ∩ F (∇) = add(C). The module
C is usually called the characteristic cotilting module.
     We would like to point out that the name (co)tilting module introduced above is slightly
confusing. In the terminology of the classical tilting theory the (co)tilting modules as
defined above are only partial (co)tilting modules. On the other hand, A−mod usually
contains many other modules, which are (co)tilting in the classical sense but are not related
to the stratified structure and thus to the (co)tilting modules defined above. However, we
will keep the above name since it is now standard and commonly accepted in the theory
of quasi-hereditary and stratified algebras. Later on, in Subsection 6.1 we will recall the
definition of a (generalized) tilting modules from the classical tilting theory. A tilting
module as defined above is a (generalized) tilting module in the classical sense if and only
if it contains a direct summand, which is isomorphic to the characteristic tilting module.
     We set L = ⊕λ∈Λ L(λ), ∆ = ⊕λ∈Λ ∆(λ), ∇ = ⊕λ∈Λ ∇(λ), ∆ = ⊕λ∈Λ ∆(λ), ∇ =
⊕λ∈Λ ∇(λ), I = ⊕λ∈Λ I(λ), and P = ⊕λ∈Λ P (λ).
     Throughout the paper we will multiply the maps from the left to the right, for instance
the composition g ◦ f of the map f : X → Y and the map g : Y → Z is denoted by f g.




                                              5
2.3    Ringel dual for standardly stratified algebras
Let (A, ≤) be an SSS-algebra. Following [AHLU1] we define the Ringel dual R = R(A)
of A as the algebra R = EndA (T ). This algebra comes together with the Ringel duality
functor

             F = F A : A-mod → R-mod,       defined by    F (− ) = HomA (T, − ).        (1)

    Due to [AHLU1, Theorem 2.6] the algebra Ropp is an SSS-algebra with the same indexing
set Λ, but with respect to the order ≤R , which is opposite to the original order ≤. The
Ringel duality asserts that the algebra Aopp is Morita equivalent to the Ringel dual of the
                                                        (R)
algebra Ropp . Moreover, the functor F sends ∇ to ∆         (the latter being defined with
                                                                     (R)
respect to ≤R ) and induces an equivalence between F (∇) and F (∆ ).


3     When is the Ringel dual properly stratified?
Let (A, ≤) be an SSS-algebra. First of all we would like to determine when the Ringel dual
R of A is properly stratified.
    For λ ∈ Λ set T <λ = ⊕µ<λ T (µ). Define further S(λ) = TrT <λ (T (λ)) and put N(λ) =
T (λ)/S(λ) giving the following short exact sequence:

                             0 → S(λ) → T (λ) → N(λ) → 0.                               (2)

Finally, set N = ⊕λ∈Λ N(λ) and F (N) = F (C), where C = {N(λ)|λ ∈ Λ}. We start with
another description of S(λ).

Lemma 1. For every λ ∈ Λ the module S(λ) is the unique submodule M of T (λ) which is
characterized by the following properties:

(a) M ∈ F ({∇(µ)|µ < λ}).

(b) T (λ)/M ∈ F ({∇(λ)}).

Proof. Let
                              0 = T0 ⊂ T1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Tk = T (λ)
be a proper costandard filtration of T (λ). Using

                      Ext1A ∇(µ1 ), ∇(µ2 ) = 0
                                            
                                                    for all µ1 < µ2 ,

we can assume that there exists 0 ≤ l < k such that Ti /Ti−1 ∼  = ∇(µ) with µ < λ for all
i ≤ l, and Ti /Ti−1 ∼
                    = ∇(λ) for all i > l. For µ < λ we apply the functor HomA (T (µ), − ) to
the short exact sequence
                               0 → Tl → T (λ) → Coker → 0,



                                             6
and obtain

             0 → HomA (T (µ), Tl ) → HomA (T (µ), T (λ)) → HomA (T (µ), Coker).

As Coker ∈ F ({∇(λ)}), T (µ) ∈ F (∆) and [T (µ) : ∆(λ)] = 0 we get HomA (T (µ), Coker) =
0. This implies that HomA (T (µ), Tl ) = HomA (T (µ), T (λ)) and thus the image of any map
f : T (µ) → T (λ) belongs to Tl . In particular, S(λ) ⊂ Tl .
    To prove that S(λ) = Tl we show by induction on i that for every 0 ≤ i ≤ l the module
Ti is a quotient of some T (i) ∈ add (⊕ν<λ T (ν)). The statement is obvious for i = 0, and
thus we have to prove only the induction step i =⇒ i + 1. Consider the short exact
sequence
                                0 → Ti → Ti+1 → ∇(ν) → 0,
where ν < λ. Then we have the map T (i) ։ Ti → Ti+1 , and an epimorphism, T (ν) ։ ∇(ν).
Since Ti , Ti+1 , ∇(ν) ∈ F (∇), and T (ν) ∈ F (∆), the epimorphism T (ν) ։ ∇(ν) can be
lifted to a map, T (ν) → Ti+1 , giving an epimorphism, T (i) ⊕ T (ν) ։ Ti+1 . Therefore
we finally obtain S(λ) = Tl . In particular, we see that S(λ) satisfies both (a) and (b),
moreover, it is unique by construction. This completes the proof.
   From the proof of Lemma 1 we also obtain the following information:

Corollary 2. (1) For each λ ∈ Λ the module N(λ) has a filtration, whose subquotients
   are isomorphic to ∇(λ).

(2) If µ < λ then HomA (T (µ), N(λ)) = 0.

  Now we are ready to formulate and prove a characterization of those SSS-algebras,
whose Ringel dual is properly stratified.

Theorem 3. Let (A, ≤) be an SSS-algebra. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

  (I) The Ringel dual (R, ≤R ) is properly stratified.

 (II) For each λ ∈ Λ we have S(λ) ∈ F (N).

(III) For each λ ∈ Λ we have T (λ) ∈ F (N).

Proof. The equivalence of the conditions (II) and (III) follows from (2).
                                                                          (R)
   Since the functor F induces an exact equivalence from F (∇) to F (∆ ), the short
exact sequence (2) gives the short exact sequence

                        0 → F (S(λ)) → F (T (λ)) → F (N(λ)) → 0.                       (3)

Moreover, F (T (λ)) = P (R) (λ) by definition.
    (II) =⇒ (I). The algebra Ropp is an SSS-algebra by [AHLU1], hence it is enough to
prove that so is R. We start with the following useful statement, which we will also use
later on.

                                             7
Lemma 4. Let (A, ≤) be an SSS-algebra. Then F (N(λ)) ∼
                                                     = ∆(R) (λ).
                                                                          (R)
Proof. Using Lemma 1, the exactness of F on F (∇), and F (∇(ν)) = ∆ (ν) for all ν ∈ Λ
                                                                (R)
we obtain that F (S(λ)) has a filtration with subquotients ∆ (µ), µ < λ. This implies
that F (S(λ)) includes into the trace of ⊕ν>R λ F (T (ν)) in F (T (λ)). On the other hand,
from Corollary 2(2) it follows that the latter inclusion is in fact the equality. Now the
statement follows from the definition of a standard module.
   Exactness of F on F (∇) and Lemma 4 imply that P (R) ∈ F ({F (N(λ))|λ ∈ Λ}). This
means that R is an SSS-algebra, and hence is properly stratified, completing the proof of
the implication (II) =⇒ (I).
   (I) =⇒ (II). Assume that R is properly stratified, in particular is an SSS-algebra. For
every λ ∈ Λ consider the short exact sequence

                         0 → K (R) (λ) → P (R) (λ) → ∆(R) (λ) → 0.
                                                            (R)                      (R)
Conditions (SS) and (PS) ensure that P (R) (λ) ∈ F (∆ ), ∆(R) (λ) ∈ F ({∆ (λ)}),
                 (R)                                                          (R)
K (R) (λ) ∈ F ({∆ (µ)|µ >R λ}). Now we can apply F −1 , which is exact on F (∆ ),
and obtain the exact sequence

                    0 → F −1 K (R) (λ) → T (λ) → F −1 ∆(R) (λ) → 0,
                                                             


moreover, F −1 ∆(R) (λ) ∈ F ({∇(λ)}), and F −1 K (R) (λ) ∈ F ({∇(µ)|µ < λ}).
                                                        
                                       −1   (R)                    −1   (R)
                                                                              From
Lemma 1 we obtain that S(λ) = F           K (λ) and N(λ) = F         ∆ (λ) . Using
K (R) (λ) ∈ F (∆(R) ) we get S(λ) ∈ F −1 F (∆(R) ) = F (N). This proves the implication
(I) =⇒ (II) and thus the proof is complete.


4    The Ringel dual of a properly stratified algebras
In general the Ringel dual of a properly stratified algebra does not need to be properly
stratified, see the example in Subsection 9.2. In this section we show that for one natural
class of properly stratified algebras this can always be guaranteed (in fact, we prove even
more, namely, that this class is closed under taking the Ringel dual). The class consists
of all properly stratified algebras for which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules
coincide. This class appeared in [MO] where it was shown that the finitistic dimension of
an algebra with duality from this class is twice the projective dimension of the character-
istic tilting module (we will extend this result in Subsection 6.4). This class contains, in
particular, all quasi-hereditary algebras.

Theorem 5. Assume that (A, ≤) is a properly stratified algebra for which the characteristic
tilting and cotilting modules coincide. Then the Ringel dual (R, ≤R ) is properly stratified,
moreover, the characteristic tilting and cotilting R-modules coincide as well.


                                              8
Proof. Let (A, ≤) be a properly stratified algebra. By Theorem 3, to show that (R, ≤R )
is properly stratified it is enough to show that S(λ) ∈ F (N) for each λ ∈ Λ. Recall that
T (λ) = C(λ) by our assumption. This gives us the following short exact sequence:

                              0 → Ker → T (λ) → ∇(λ) → 0,

where Ker has a filtration by ∇(µ), µ < λ. Since A is properly stratified, filtrations by
costandard modules extend to filtrations by the corresponding proper costandard modules.
Hence we can use Lemma 1 to obtain S(λ) = Ker and N(λ) = ∇(λ). This implies that
(R, ≤R ) is properly stratified.
    It is left to show that T (R) = C (R) . By [AHLU1, Theorem 2.6(vi)], F (I) is the charac-
teristic cotilting R-module, and, since R is properly stratified, we need only to show that
F (I) ∈ F (∆(R) ). However, since A is properly stratified, we have I ∈ F (∇) = F (N), F
is exact on F (∇), and F (N) = ∆(R) by Lemma 4. This implies that F (I) ∈ F (∆(R) ) and
completes the proof.


5    Module H: definition and basic properties
Now we can make the principal assumption until the end of the paper: we assume that
(A, ≤) is an SSS-algebra such that the Ringel dual (R, ≤R ) is properly stratified.
    There are two possibilities. The first one is the case when T (R) = C (R) . In this case
Theorem 5 says that the algebra A itself is properly stratified and, moreover, that T = C.
Hence the behavior of the Ringel duality in this case is completely similar to the classical
case of quasi-hereditary algebras (which is in fact a special case of this situation).
    The second case is when T (R) 6∼  = C (R) . In this case it is possible that the algebras
EndR (T (R) ) and EndR (C (R) ) are quite different (see the example in Subsection 9.2). Later
on in the paper we will show that this situation leads to a new Ringel type duality, which
we call the two-step duality, on a subclass of SSS-algebras. In the special case of quasi-
hereditary algebras, and even in the more general situation of properly stratified algebras
for which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules coincide, the two-step duality
degenerates to the identity functor.
                                                                                          (R)
    Since the Ringel duality functor F induces an equivalence between F (∇) and F (∆ ),
                                          (R)
we can take the module T (R) (λ) ∈ F (∆ ) and define H(λ) = F −1 T (R) (λ) for all λ ∈ Λ.
                                                                               

Set H = ⊕λ∈Λ H(λ). The module H will be the main object of our interest in the sequel.
We start with some basic properties of the modules N and H.
Proposition 6. (i) All tilting modules belong to F (N) and are exactly the relatively
    (ext-)projective modules in F (N), that is for M ∈ F (N) the module M is tilting if
    and only if ExtiA (M, N) = 0 for all i > 0.

 (ii) add(H) ⊂ F (N) and the modules from add(H) are exactly the relatively (ext-)injec-
      tive modules in F (N), that is for M ∈ F (N) we have M ∈ add(H) if and only if
      ExtiA (N, M) = 0 for all i > 0.

                                              9
Proof. We start with (i). That all tilting modules belong to F (N) follows from Theo-
rem 3(III). Assume that M is a tilting module. Then ExtiA (M, N) = 0 for all i > 0 by
[AHLU1, Lemma 1.2] since M ∈ F (∆) and N ∈ F (∇). To prove the opposite statement,
assume that M ∈ F (N) and ExtiA (M, N) = 0, for all i > 0. Since M ∈ F (N) ⊂ F (∇), we
only need to prove that M ∈ F (∆).
   Let λ ∈ Λ and X be a submodule of N(λ) such that we have the following short exact
sequence:
                            0 → X → N(λ) → ∇(λ) → 0,
where X has a filtration with subquotients ∇(λ). Applying HomA (M, − ) to this short
exact sequence we get the following fragment in the long exact sequence
   · · · → ExtiA (M, N(λ)) → ExtiA (M, ∇(λ)) → Exti+1           i+1
                                                  A (M, X) → ExtA (M, N(λ)) . . . .

The condition ExtiA (M, N(λ)) = 0, i > 0, gives us a dimension shift between the spaces
ExtiA (M, ∇(λ)) and Exti+1
                        A (M, X).
   To proceed we need the following statement:
Lemma 7. The module N has finite projective dimension.
Proof. We prove that p.d.(N(λ)) < ∞ by induction on λ ∈ Λ. Suppose λ is minimal.
Then N(λ) ∼ = T (λ) and hence p.d.(N(λ)) < ∞. Now assume by induction that for all
µ < λ we have p.d.(N(µ)) < ∞. Since S(λ) is filtered by N(µ), µ < λ, it follows that
p.d.(S(λ)) < ∞. The exact sequence (2) and p.d.(T (λ)) < ∞ now implies p.d.(N(λ)) < ∞
and completes the proof.
    Since M ∈ F (N), Lemma 7 implies that p.d.(M) < ∞. This forces the equality
ExtiA (M, ∇(λ)) = 0 for all i big enough. Thus, the dimension shift and the fact that X
is filtered by ∇(λ), guarantees that ExtiA (M, ∇(λ)) = 0 for all i > 0. From [AHLU1,
Theorem 1.6] we now obtain M ∈ F (∆), which completes the proof of (i).
                                                   (R)
    Now let us prove (ii). Since F : F (∇) → F (∆ ) is an equivalence with F (∇) = {X ∈
A−mod|Ext>0  A (T, M) = 0} and F (N) ⊂ F (∇), we obtain that for all i ≥ 0 and for all
M1 , M2 ∈ F (N) we have
                          ExtiA (M1 , M2 ) ∼
                                           = ExtiR F M1 , F M2 .
                                                                
                                                                                     (4)
Put M1 = N and M2 = H. By Lemma 4 we have F N = ∆(R) and by the definition we
                                                            

have F H = T (R) . Therefore H ∈ F (N) and (4) guarantees
                            ExtiA (N, H) ∼= ExtiR ∆(R) , T (R) = 0,
                                                              

              (R)
as T (R) ∈ F (∇ ). This proves that H is relatively injective in F (N).
    To prove the opposite statement, we assume thatM ∈ F (N) and ExtiA (N, M) = 0for
all i > 0. Using (4) we get that ExtiR ∆(R) , F M = 0, which implies that F M ∈
      (R)
F (∇ ) by [AHLU1, Theorem 1.6]. Moreover, F M ∈ F (∆(R) ) since M ∈ F (N),
                                                        

F (N) = ∆(R) , and F is exact on F (N) ⊂ F (∇). Hence F M is a tilting R-module
                                                                   

and thus M ∈ add(H) by the definition of H. This completes the proof.

                                          10
Proposition 8. Let λ ∈ Λ. Then there exist the following exact sequences:

                             0 → ∇(λ) → H(λ) → Coker1 → 0,                                  (5)
                             0 → N(λ) → H(λ) → Coker2 → 0,                                  (6)

where Coker1 has a filtration with subquotients ∇(µ), µ ≥ λ and Coker2 has a filtration
with subquotients N(µ), µ > λ.
Proof. Applying F −1 to the exact sequence
                                                               (R)
                                                      ^2
                           0 → ∆(R) (λ) → T (R) (λ) → Coker          → 0,                   (7)
            (R)
      ^ 2 ∈ F (∆(R) ) (see [AHLU1, Lemma 2.5(iv)]), gives (6).
where Coker
   Since R is properly stratified, all standard modules have proper standard filtrations
and hence (7) gives rise to the exact sequence
                                                               (R)

                                                          ^1
                                        (λ) → T (R) (λ) → Coker      → 0,                   (8)
            (R)
      ^1
where Coker
                       (R)
                  ∈ F (∆     ). Applying F −1 to (8) gives (5). This completes the proof.


6     Module H: advanced properties
6.1    H is a (generalized) tilting module
Recall that a module, M, over an associative algebra A is called a (generalized) tilting
module (see for example [Ha, Chapter III]) if the following three conditions are satisfied:
 (i) ExtiA (M, M) = 0, i > 0;

 (ii) p.d.(M) < ∞;

(iii) there is an exact sequence 0 → A A → M0 → M1 → · · · → Mk → 0, where k ≥ 0 and
      Mi ∈ add(M).
We would like to emphasize once more that a tilting module, M, over an SSS-algebra is a
(generalized) tilting module in the above sense if and only if M contains a direct summand,
which is isomorphic to the characteristic tilting module, see Subsection 2.2. Now we can
state the following:
Proposition 9. The module H is a (generalized) tilting module.
Proof. We split the proof into a sequence of lemmas.
Lemma 10.
                               Exti (H, H) = 0        for all i > 0.

                                                 11
Proof. This follows directly from the second statement of Proposition 6.
Lemma 11. The module H has finite projective dimension.
Proof. Since H ∈ F (N), the statement follows from Lemma 7.
Lemma 12. For every X ∈ add(T ) there exists a minimal coresolution,
                              0 → X → H0 → H1 → · · · → Hk → 0,
where Hi ∈ add(H) for all i and 0 ≤ k ≤ p.d.(T (R) ).
   Note that the length of the coresolution in Lemma 12 is estimated in terms of the
projective dimension of the tilting module over the Ringel dual R.
Proof. The module F (X) is a projective R-module and hence, by [Ha, Section III.2.2],
there exists a finite coresolution,
                                   (R)   (R)          (R)
                        0 → F X → T0 → T1 → · · · → Tk → 0,                      (9)
        (R)
where Ti ∈ add(T (R) ) for all i, of length k ≤ p.d.(T (R) ). Applying F −1 to (9) yields the
exact sequence
                                    (R)           (R)                   (R)
                 0 → X → F −1 (T0 ) → F −1 (T1 ) → · · · → F −1 (Tk ) → 0,
              (R)
where F −1 (Ti      ) ∈ add(H) for all i. This completes the proof.
Lemma 13. There is an exact sequence
                             0 → A A → H0 → H1 → · · · → Hm → 0,
where Hi ∈ add(H).
Proof. Choose a minimal tilting coresolution,
                              0 → A A → T0 → T1 → · · · → Tk → 0,
where Ti ∈ add(T ) and k = p.d.(T ), and consider the corresponding positive complex
                           · · · → 0 → T0 → T1 → · · · → Tk → 0 → . . . ,               (10)
in Kb (add(T )), whose only non-zero homology is in degree zero and equals A A. Applying
Lemma 39 to A = A, X (A) = T , Y (A) = H and the complex (10) we obtain a complex,
                          · · · → 0 → H0 → H1 → · · · → Hk ′ → 0 → . . . ,
in Kb (add(H)), which is quasi-isomorphic to (10). This completes the proof.
   The proof of Proposition 9 is now also complete.
   We remark that, since H is a (generalized) tilting module, the minimal length of the
coresolution, given by Lemma 13, is equal to p.d.(H), see for example [Ha, Chapter III].

                                                12
6.2    H and fin.dim.(A)
Recall that the (projectively defined) finitistic dimension of A is defined as follows:

                 fin.dim(A) = sup{p.d.(M)|M ∈ A-mod, p.d.(M) < ∞}.

    In [AHLU2] it was shown that the projectively defined finitistic dimension of a properly
stratified (and even SSS-) algebra is finite (and even that the injectively defined finitistic
dimension of such algebra is finite as well). In this subsection we show that the module H
can be used to effectively compute fin.dim(A).

Proposition 14. Let M ∈ A−mod and p.d.(M) < ∞. Then there exists a finite coreso-
lution,
                        0 → M → H0 → · · · → Hk → 0,
where Hi ∈ add(H) and k ≥ 0.

Proof. First we choose a minimal projective resolution,

                           0 → Pn → · · · → P1 → P0 → M → 0,

of M, and obtain the complex

                  P• :      · · · → 0 → Pn → · · · → P1 → P0 → 0 → . . . ,

where P0 stays in degree zero. The complex P • has the only non-zero homology in degree
zero, which equals M. Applying Lemma 39 to A = A, X (A) = P , Y (A) = H and the complex
P • [−n] we obtain a complex, shifting which by n in the derived category gives the complex

      H• :      · · · → 0 → H−n → · · · → H−1 → H0 → H1 → · · · → Hk → 0 → . . . ,

in Kb (add(H)), where k ≥ 0, which is quasi-isomorphic to P • . This implies that the only
non-zero homology of H• is in degree zero and equals M. Let us show that H• is quasi-
isomorphic to a positive complex from Kb (add(H)). In fact we will show by a downward
induction on l that for every 0 ≤ l ≤ n there exists a complex,

 H(l)• : · · · → 0 → H(l)−l → · · · → H(l)−1 → H(l)0 → H(l)1 → · · · → H(l)k → 0 → . . . ,

in Kb (add(H)), which is quasi-isomorphic to H• .
   For l = n the statement is obvious with H(n)• = H• . Assume that the complex H(l)• ,
0 < l ≤ n, is constructed and let us construct the complex H(l − 1)• .
   From H(l)• we obtain the short exact sequence

                     0 → H(l)−l → H(l)−l+1 → H(l)−l+1/H(l)−l → 0.                         (11)

We are going to show that H(l)−l+1/H(l)−l ∈ add(H). Since H(l)−l , H(l)−l+1 ∈ F (∇),
and F (∇) is closed with respect to taking cokernels of monomorphisms, we obtain that

                                             13
H(l)−l+1 /H(l)−l ∈ F (∇) as well. Hence we can apply the Ringel duality functor F to (11)
and obtain the exact sequence
                 0 → F (H(l)−l ) → F (H(l)−l+1) → F (H(l)−l+1 /H(l)−l ) → 0                  (12)
in R−mod. The modules F (H(l)−l ) and F (H(l)−l+1) are tilting R-modules and there-
                            (R)                                                    (R)
fore are contained in F (∇ ). Thus F (H(l)−l /H(l)−l+1) is contained in F (∇ ) as well
by the same arguments as above. Moreover, the modules F (H(l)−l ), F (H(l)−l+1 ), and
                                             (R)
F (H(l)−l /H(l)−l+1 ) are contained in F (∆ ) by the Ringel duality.
    Both F (H(l)−l ) and F (H(l)−l+1 ) have finite projective dimension and therefore the pro-
jective dimension of F (H(l)−l+1 /H(l)−l ) is also finite. To show that F (H(l)−l+1 /H(l)−l ) ∈
F (∆(R) ), we use the the following lemma:
Lemma 15. Let A be a properly stratified algebra. Then
                                 (A)
 (i) F (∆(A) ) = {M (A) ∈ F (∆ ) | p.d.(M (A) ) < ∞}, and
                                 (A)
 (ii) F (∇(A) ) = {M (A) ∈ F (∇ ) | i.d.(M (A) ) < ∞}.
Proof. We prove (i). The statement (ii) is proved by similar arguments.
                                           (A)
    The inclusion F (∆(A) ) ⊂ {M (A) ∈ F (∆ ) | p.d.(M (A) ) < ∞} can be found for example
in [PR, Proposition 1.3] or in [AHLU1, Proposition 1.8].
                                                           (A)
    Let us prove the inverse inclusion. Let M (A) ∈ F (∆ ) and λ ∈ Λ. Consider a short
exact sequence,
                                                     (A)
                            0 → X (A) → ∇(A) (λ) → ∇ (λ) → 0,                         (13)
                                                      (A)
where X (A) has a filtration with subquotients ∇ (λ). Applying HomA (M (A) , − ) to (13) we
get the long exact sequence
                                                                          (A)
  · · · → ExtiA (M (A) , X (A) ) → ExtiA (M (A) , ∇(A) (λ)) → ExtiA (M (A) , ∇ (λ)) →
                                            (A)
                                  → Exti+1
                                       A (M     , X (A) ) → Exti+1
                                                               A (M
                                                                    (A)
                                                                        , ∇(A) (λ)) → . . . . (14)
But ExtiA (M (A) , ∇(A) (λ)) = 0 for i > 0, which gives us a dimension shift between the
                         (A)
spaces ExtiA (M (A) , ∇ (λ)) and Exti+1A (M
                                            (A)
                                                , X (A) ). Since p.d.(M (A) ) is finite, we derive
                     (A)
that ExtiA (M (A) , ∇ (λ)) = 0 for all i big enough. But the dimension shift and the fact
                                                  (A)                               (A)
that X (A) has a filtration with subquotients ∇ (λ) imply that ExtiA (M (A) , ∇ (λ)) = 0 for
all i. Hence M (A) ∈ F (∆(A) ) by [AHLU1, Theorem 1.6(iii)]. This completes the proof of
Lemma 15.
    From Lemma 15 it follows that F (H(l)−l+1/H(l)−l ) has a standard filtration and thus
is a tilting module. Applying F −1 we obtain H(l)−l+1 /H(l)−l ∈ add(H). From Lemma 10
it now follows that the short exact sequence (11) splits. This means that H(l)−l is a direct
summand of H(l)−l+1 and by deleting it we construct the complex H(l − 1)• .
    This proves the existence of the complex H(0)• , which happens to be a positive complex
in Kb (add(H)) quasi-isomorphic to P • . This completes the proof.

                                                 14
Corollary 16. Let M ∈ P(A)<∞ . Then the module M belongs to add(H) if and only if
ExtiA (X, M) = 0 for all i > 0 and all X ∈ P(A)<∞ .
Proof. Let M ∈ add(H). That ExtiA (X, M) = 0 for all i > 0 and all X ∈ P(A)<∞ follows
easily from ExtiA (H, H) = 0, i > 0, and Proposition 14 by induction on the length of the
add(H)-coresolution of M.
    Let M ∈ P(A)<∞ be such that ExtiA (X, M) = 0 for all i > 0 and all X ∈ P(A)<∞ ,
and let H0 ∈ add(H) be such that M ֒→ H0 (such H0 exists by Proposition 14). Then the
cokernel of the latter embedding belongs to P(A)<∞ and hence the above condition on M
implies that M is in fact a direct summand of H0 , that is M ∈ add(H).
Theorem 17. Let A be an SSS-algebra such that the Ringel dual R of A is properly
stratified. Then
                           fin.dim(A) = p.d.(H).
Proof. If 0 → X → Y → Z → 0 is an exact sequence then the long exact sequence implies
that
                        p.d.(X) ≤ max{p.d.(Y ), p.d.(Z)}.                       (15)
Let M ∈ P(A)<∞ . Applying (15) inductively to the add(H)-coresolution of M, constructed
in Proposition 14, one obtains p.d.(M) ≤ p.d.(H). This proves the statement of the
theorem.
   Note that Theorem 17 implies, in particular, that fin.dim(A) is finite (we have never
used the corresponding result from [AHLU2]).

6.3    Existence of H guarantees that the category of modules of
       finite projective dimension is contravariantly finite
For a full subcategory, C, of A-mod, denote by Cˇ the full subcategory of A-mod, which
contains all modules M for which there is a finite exact sequence,

                            0 → M → C0 → C1 → · · · → Ck → 0,

with Ci ∈ C. The category Cˆ is defined dually.
    Recall that a full subcategory, C, of A-mod is called contravariantly finite provided that
it is closed under direct summands and isomorphisms, and for each A-module X there
exists a homomorphism f : CX → X, where CX ∈ C, such that for any homomorphism
g : C → X with C ∈ C there is a homomorphism h : C → CX such that f ◦ h = g.
    Recall also that a subcategory, B, of A-mod is called resolving if it contains all projective
modules and is closed under extensions and kernels of epimorphisms. Obviously, P(A)<∞
is a resolving category. However, P <∞ is not contravariantly finite in general, see [IST].
Our main result in this subsection is the following:
Theorem 18. Let A be an SSS-algebra, whose Ringel dual is properly stratified. Then
P <∞ is contravariantly finite in A−mod.

                                               15
                                                                     ˇ
Proof. Since H is a (generalized) tilting module, the subcategory add(H) is contravariantly
                                                                                      ˇ
finite and resolving by [AR, Section 5]. From Proposition 14 we see that P <∞ ⊂ add(H).
On the other hand, p.d.(H) < ∞ implies P     <∞        ˇ
                                                 ⊃ add(H).  This completes the proof.

6.4    H and fin.dim.(A) for algebras with duality
In this section we calculate the finitistic dimension of a properly stratified algebra A having
a simple preserving duality in terms of the projective dimension of the characteristic tilting
module. This generalizes the main result in [MO], where analogous result is obtained under
the assumption that the characteristic tilting and cotilting A-modules coincide. The main
result of the section is:

Theorem 19. Let A be a properly stratified algebra having a simple preserving duality,
whose Ringel dual R is also properly stratified. Then

                                      fin.dim(A) = 2p.d.(T (R) ).

   To prove the statement we will need several lemmas.

Lemma 20. Let A be as in Theorem 19. Then

                                         p.d.(T (R) ) ≤ p.d.(T ).

Proof. Since T is a tilting module, we can choose a minimal tilting coresolution,

                               0 → P → T0 → T1 → · · · → Ta → 0,

of P , where a = p.d.(T ). From this coresolution we obtain the complex

                          · · · → 0 → T0 → T1 → · · · → Ta → 0 → . . . ,

in which the only non-zero homology is in degree zero and equals P .
   On the other hand, the module F (H) is tilting over R, in particular, it has finite
projective dimension. Hence we can choose a minimal projective resolution,
                                (R)               (R)           (R)
                        0 → Pb        → · · · → P1      → P0          → F (H) → 0,

of F (H), where b = p.d.(T (R) ). Applying F −1 we get a minimal tilting resolution,
                        (R)                               (R)                        (R)
   0 → T(b) = F −1 (Pb ) → · · · → T(1) = F −1 (P1 ) → T(0) = F −1 (P0 ) → H → 0,          (16)

of H. Hence we also obtain the complex

                 J• :         · · · → 0 → T(b) → · · · → T(1) → T(0) → 0 → . . . ,

in which the only non-zero homology is in degree zero and equals H.

                                                     16
   If 0 → X → Y → Z → 0 is an exact sequence, then p.d.(Z) ≤ max{p.d.(X), p.d.(Y )}+
1. Applying this inequality inductively to (16) we get

                                           p.d.(H) ≤ a + b.                              (17)
              ◦
   Applying       to J • gives the complex

                   C• :                    ◦
                             · · · → 0 → T(0)     ◦
                                              → T(1)             ◦
                                                     → · · · → T(b) → 0 → ...,

where the only non-zero homology is in degree zero and equals H ◦ . Remark that the
complex C • consists of cotilting A-modules. We would like to substitute C • [b] by a negative
complex from K(add(T )). To be able to do this we need the following lemma:
Lemma 21. Let A be a properly stratified algebra. Then for each λ ∈ Λ there exists a
(possibly infinite) minimal tilting resolution of C(λ), which has the following form:

                              · · · → T1 → T (λ) ⊕ T0 → C(λ) → 0.

Proof. Let λ ∈ Λ. Since C(λ) has a proper costandard filtration, we can apply the Ringel
duality functor F and get the R-module F (C(λ)). Choose a minimal projective resolution,
                                       (R)       (R)
                              · · · → P1     → P0        → F (C(λ)) → 0,                 (18)
of F (C(λ)). Since C(λ) surjects onto ∇(λ) and ∇(λ) has a filtration with subquotients
                                                                                 (R)
∇(λ), applying F it follows that there is an epimorphism from F (C(λ)) to ∆ (λ). Hence
                                                                             (R)
we conclude that the head of F (C(λ)) contains L(R) (λ), and therefore P0 = P (R) (λ) ⊕
                                                                        (R)
P̂ (R) , where P̂ (R) is some projective R-module. Since F (C(λ)) ∈ F (∆ ) and (18) is exact,
                                                                   (R)
it follows that the kernels of all morphisms in (18) belong to F (∆ ) as well. The statement
                                                                    (R)
of the lemma now follows by applying F −1 to (18) and taking P0 = P (R) (λ) ⊕ P̂ (R) into
account.
   From Lemma 21 it follows that we can apply Lemma 40 to A = A, X (A) = C, Y (A) =
T and the complex C • [b], and obtain a negative complex in K(add(T )), which is quasi-
isomorphic to C • [b]. Shifting the latter one by −b in the derived category gives a complex,

                  T•:      · · · → T (0) → · · · → T (b − 1) → T (b) → 0 → . . . ,

in K− (add(T )) with the only non-zero homology in degree zero, which equals H ◦ . We
assume that T • is minimal that is does not contain trivial direct summands. Lemma 21
implies that T (b) = T(b) ⊕ T̂ for some tilting module T̂ .
   We have
                                             ◦ •
        Ext2b     ◦                 •                               •       •
           A (H, H ) = HomD − (A) (H [−b], (H ) [b]) = HomD − (A) (J [−b], T [b]) .

From [Ha, Chap. III, Lemma 2.1] we have

                    HomD− (A) (J • [−b], T • [b]) = HomK− (A) (J • [−b], T • [b]) .

                                                    17
Let f : T(b) ֒→ T (b) be the inclusion, defined via the isomorphism of T(b) with the first direct
summand of T (b). Denote by g : T(b) → T(b−1) and h : T (b − 1) → T (b) the differentials in
the complexes J • and T • respectively and consider the following diagram:
                                                                          F (g)                 
                                                        F T(b)                     /F   T(b−1)
                                            α                              β
                                                                  F (f )
                                      w     F (h)                    x
                            F (T (b − 1))           /   F (T (b))

The minimality of J • [−b] and T • [b] implies that the images of the morphisms F (g) and
F (h) belong to the radicals of the corresponding modules. Hence for every α and β as
depicted on the diagram the image of F (h) ◦ α + β ◦ F (g) belongs to the radical of F (T (b)).
However the image of F (f ) does not belong to the radical of F (T (b)). This means that
the morphism f induces a non-zero homomorphism from J • [−b] to T • [b] in K − (A). From
this we conclude that Ext2b       ◦
                          A (H, H ) 6= 0 and hence

                                                2b ≤ p.d.(H).                                        (19)

Combining (17) and (19) we obtain b ≤ a, which completes the proof of Lemma 20.
   The arguments above immediately imply:

Corollary 22. ExtiA (H, H ◦ ) = 0 for all i > 2p.d.(T (R) ).

   Further, we can derive the following inequality (compare with [EP, Theorem 2.2.1]):

Lemma 23. Let A be as in Theorem 19 and k = p.d.(H). Then ExtkA (H, H ◦ ) 6= 0.

Proof. Choose a minimal projective resolution,

                              0 → Pk → · · · → P1 → P0 → H → 0,

of H and let
                     P• :       · · · → 0 → Pk → · · · → P1 → P0 → 0 → . . .
be the corresponding complex in Kb (add(P )). Choose also a minimal (possibly infinite)
projective resolution,
                             · · · → Q1 → Q0 → H ◦ → 0,
of H ◦ , and construct the corresponding (possibly infinite) complex

                              Q• :        · · · → Q1 → Q0 → 0 → . . . .
           ◦
Applying       to the short exact sequence

                                     0 → ∇ → H → Coker → 0


                                                         18
given by Proposition 8, we obtain the short exact sequence

                                0 → Coker◦ → H ◦ → ∆ → 0.

It follows that the head of H ◦ contains the head of ∆, which coincides with L. Hence
Q0 = P ⊕ Q, where Q is some projective module. Using the same arguments as in the
proof of Lemma 20 we obtain HomD− (A) (P • , Q• [k]) 6= 0 and hence ExtkA (H, H ◦) 6= 0. This
completes the proof.
    Now we are ready to prove Theorem 19.
Proof of Theorem 19. Let k = p.d.(H). Using Theorem 17 we have k = fin.dim(A). From
Lemma 23 we obtain that ExtkA (H, H ◦ ) 6= 0. Certainly, ExtiA (H, H ◦ ) = 0 for all i > k. But
from the proof of Lemma 20 and from Corollary 22 we conclude k = 2b. This completes
the proof.
    To relate the finitistic dimension of A to p.d.(T ) we will need a stronger assumption.
Proposition 24. Let A be as in Theorem 19 and assume that R also has a simple pre-
serving duality. Then
                              fin.dim(A) = 2p.d.(T ).
Proof. From Lemma 20 we have p.d.(T (R) ) ≤ p.d.(T ). The existence of the duality for both
A and R implies that p.d.(T (R) ) = i.d.(C (R) ) and p.d.(T ) = i.d.(C). Applying Lemma 20
to Aopp and Ropp and using the usual duality we obtain i.d.(C) ≤ i.d.(C (R) ). Altogether
we deduce p.d.(T (R) ) = p.d.(T ) and the statement follows from Theorem 19.
   We remark that if A is as in Theorem 19, then R does not necessarily have a simple
preserving duality, see the example in Subsection 9.3.


7      Two-step duality for standardly stratified algebras
Since H is a (generalized) tilting module, the classical tilting theory suggests to study the
algebra B(A) = EndA (H). Consider the functor G : A-mod → B(A)-mod defined via

                                  G(− ) = D ◦ HomA (− , H).

From the definition it follows that G(H) is an injective cogenerator of B(A).
   Consider also the functor G′ : B(A)-mod → A-mod defined via

                                G′ (− ) = HomB(A) (G(A), − ).

    We start with establishing some necessary properties of the functor G.
Lemma 25.        1. G is exact on P(A)<∞ , and maps P(A)<∞ to I(B(A))<∞ .

    2. G is full and faithful on P(A)<∞ .

                                              19
Proof. That G is exact on P(A)<∞ follows from Corollary 16. Let M ∈ A-mod be such
that p.d.(M) < ∞. By Proposition 14 there exists a coresolution

                               0 → M → H0 → · · · → Hk → 0,                          (20)

where Hi ∈ add(H) and k ≥ 0. Applying the exact functor G gives the exact sequence

                       0 → G(M) → G(H0 ) → · · · → G(Hk ) → 0,

in B(A)-mod. Since G(Hj ) is B(A)-injective for all j, we obtain that the injective dimen-
sion of G(M) is finite. This proves the first statement.
    Let us now prove that G is full and faithful on P(A)<∞ . We start with showing that
G is full and faithful on add(H). For this we calculate the following:

 G′ ◦ G(A HB(A) ) =
          = HomB(A)− D ◦ HomA (A AA , A HB(A) ), D ◦ HomA (A HB(A) , A HB(A) ) =
                                                                              
                                                                         
             = Hom−B(A) HomA (A HB(A) , A HB(A) ), HomA (A AA , A HB(A) ) =
                                                                        
                                          = Hom−B(A) B(A), A HB(A) = A HB(A) , (21)

and

 G ◦ G′ (B(A) D(B(A)opp )) =
      = D ◦ HomA HomB(A)− D ◦ HomA (A AA , A HB(A) ), B(A) D(B(A)opp ) , A HB(A) =
                                                                               

          = D ◦ HomA Hom−B(A) B(A)B(A) , HomA (A AA , A HB(A) ) , A HB(A) =
                                                                          

                = D ◦ HomA Hom−B(A) B(A)B(A) , A HB(A) , A HB(A) =
                                                                  

                             = D ◦ HomA A HB(A) , A HB(A) = B(A) D(B(A)opp ), (22)
                                                             

which implies that G is full and faithful on add(H).
    Now the fact that G is full and faithful on P(A)<∞ follows from the existence of (20)
for all M ∈ P(A)<∞ by induction on the length of the coresolution (20). This completes
the proof.
Lemma 26.       1. The functor G maps N(λ) to ∇(B(A)) (λ) for all λ ∈ Λ.

  2. The algebra (B(A)opp , ≤) is an SSS-algebra.
Proof. For λ ∈ Λ consider the short exact sequence

                               0 → N(λ) → H(λ) → Y (λ) → 0,

where Y (λ) has a filtration with subquotients N(µ), µ > λ (see Proposition 8). Because
of the exactness of G on P(A)<∞ , see Lemma 25, and the fact that p.d.(N) < ∞, the
sequence above yields the short exact sequence

                      0 → G (N(λ)) → I (B(A)) (λ) → G (Y (λ)) → 0,

                                            20
where G (Y (λ)) has a filtration with subquotients G (N(µ)), µ > λ. Further, using the
classical Ringel duality, for λ < µ we have

                   HomA (N(λ), H(µ)) = HomR ∆(R) (λ), T (R) (µ) = 0
                                                               


(we recall that ∆(R) (λ) are defined with respect to ≤R , which is opposite to the original
order ≤). Using the fact that G is full and faithful on F (N) ⊂ P(A)<∞ we obtain

   G (N(λ)) : L(B(A)) (µ) = dimk HomB(A) G (N(λ)) , I (B(A)) (µ) =
                                                              

                                                      = dimk HomA (N(λ), H(µ)) = 0.

    So the family {G (N(λ)) |λ ∈ Λ} ⊂ B(A)-mod satisfies all the conditions, characterizing
the costandard modules for SSS-algebras (see for example [AHLU1, Lemma 1.5]). This
implies G (N(λ)) = ∇(B(A)) (λ). Exactness of G on F (N) ⊂ P(A)<∞ guarantees that the
injective cogenerator G(H) of B(A) is filtered by costandard modules. This completes the
proof of both statements of the lemma.

Lemma 27.    1. G(A) is a (generalized) cotilting module for B(A).
              (B(A)) 
  2. G(A) ∈ F ∆        .

Proof. Using Lemma 25 one easily obtains

                        ExtiB(A) G(A), G(A) = ExtiA A, A = 0
                                                       


for all i > 0. Since p.d.(A) = 0 < ∞, from Lemma 25 it also follows that i.d.(G(A)) < ∞.
Since H has finite projective dimension, we can take a minimal projective resolution,

                          0 → Pk → · · · → P1 → P0 → H → 0,

of H. Since all modules in this resolution have finite projective dimension we can apply G
and use Lemma 25 to obtain a resolution of the injective cogenerator G(H) over B(A) by
modules G(Pi ) from add(G(A)). Hence G(A) is a (generalized) cotilting module for B(A).
   Using Lemma 25 and Lemma 26 one gets

          ExtiB(A) G(A), ∇(B(A)) = ExtiB(A) (G(A), G (N)) = ExtiA (A, N) = 0,
                                  

                  (B(A)) 
implying G(A) ∈ F ∆        . This completes the proof.

Lemma 28. The functor G induces an equivalence between F (N) and F (∇(B(A)) ) with the
inverse functor G′ .

Proof. By Lemma 25 for M ∈ P(A)<∞ we have

               G′ ◦ G(M) = HomB(A) (G(A), G(M)) = HomA (A, M) = M,                    (23)

                                            21
which implies that G′ ◦ G is isomorphic to the identity functor on F (N).
    After Lemma 25 we have that G is full and faithful on F (N), and thus we have only
to prove that it is dense.
    From the second statement of Lemma 27 we obtain that G′ is exact on F (∇(B(A)) ).
(21) and (22) imply that G′ is full and faithful on add(D(B(A)opp )) that is on all B(A)-
injective modules. Since every module with a costandard filtration has a finite coresolution
by injective modules we obtain that G′ is full and faithful on F (∇(B(A)) ). But (23) implies
that G′ : F (∇(B(A)) ) → F (N) and is dense. Thus G′ is an equivalence and (23) implies
that G is inverse to G′ , hence is dense as well. This completes the proof.
   Now we can formulate the main result of this section.
Theorem 29. Let (A, ≤) be an SSS-algebra, whose Ringel dual (R, ≤R ) is properly strat-
ified. Then
 (i) The algebra B(A)opp is an SSS-algebra and is isomorphic to the opposite algebra of
     the second Ringel dual EndR (T (R) ).

 (ii) B(A)opp has the Ringel dual (Ropp , ≤R ), which is properly stratified, and the algebra
      B(B(A)opp )opp is Morita equivalent to A.
Proof. That (B(A)opp , ≤) is an SSS-algebra was proved in Lemma 26. The statement about
the second Ringel dual follows from the usual Ringel duality ([AHLU1, Theorem 2.6]) by

                         EndA (H) = EndR F H = EndR (T (R) ),
                                                 


since F H = T (R) . This proves (i).
           

    Now we prove (ii). We start with calculation of the indecomposable tilting modules in
B(A)opp . Composing the functor G with the duality D : B(A)-mod → B(A)opp -mod, we
get the contravariant functor D ◦ G : A-mod → B(A)opp -mod. Applying this functor to the
short exact sequence (2) and using the exactness of G on F (N), we get the exact sequence

                  0 → D ◦ G(N(λ)) → D ◦ G(T (λ)) → D ◦ G(S(λ)) → 0,
                                             opp
where D ◦ G(N(λ)) = D∇(B(A)) (λ) = ∆(B(A) ) (λ), and D ◦ G(S(λ)) has a filtration with
                   opp
subquotients ∆(B(A) ) (µ), µ < λ. Moreover, using Lemma 28, we have

            0 = ExtiA (T (λ), N(µ)) ∼
                                                        opp
                                    = ExtiB(A)opp ∆(B(A) ) (µ), D ◦ G T (λ)
                                                                            

                                                    (B(A)opp )
for all λ, µ and i > 0. Hence D ◦ G T (λ) ∈ F (∇

                                                               ) and we can conclude that
D ◦ G T (λ) is an indecomposable tilting module, and, moreover, that D ◦ G T (λ) =
                                                                                     

                      EndB(A)opp T (B(A) ) = EndA (T )opp = Ropp ,

   Hence we have the corresponding functor F B(A) : B(A)opp -mod → Ropp -mod. Since

where h denotes Morita equivalence. This completes the proof.
   Lemma 25 and Lemma 28 admit the following extension:
Proposition 30. The functor G induces an equivalence between P(A)<∞ and I(B(A))<∞
with the inverse functor G′ .
   To prove this we will need the following lemma:
Lemma 31. Let M (B(A)) ∈ I(B(A))<∞ . Then there exists a resolution,
                          (B(A))                  (B(A))        (B(A))
                   0 → Yk          → · · · → Y1            → Y0          → M (B(A)) → 0,
        (B(A))
where Yi         ∈ add(G(A)) for all i.
Proof. Consider an injective coresolution,
                                         (B(A))        (B(A))
                    0 → M (B(A)) → I0             → I1                     (B(A))
                                                                → · · · → Im      → 0,

of M (B(A)) and let M• be the corresponding complex in K(I (B(A)) ). Applying Lemma 39
to A = B(A)opp , X (A) = D(I (B(A)) ), Y (A) = D(G(A)) and the complex D(M• ) gives a finite
complex, the dual of which belongs to K(add(G(A))) and is quasi-isomorphic to M• . The
necessary resolution is now obtained using the projectivity of A A, properties of G given by
Lemma 25, and arguments dual to those used in Proposition 14. We omit the details.
   We are now ready to prove Proposition 30.
Proof of Proposition 30. By Lemma 25 for M ∈ P(A)<∞ we have

                  G′ ◦ G(M) = HomB(A) (G(A), G(M)) = HomA (A, M) = M,                                         (24)

which implies that G′ ◦G is isomorphic to the identity functor on P(A)<∞ . From Lemma 25
we have that G is full and faithful on P(A)<∞ and thus we are only left to prove that it
is dense. From Lemma 31, using induction on the length of the add(G(A))-resolution, we
obtain that ExtiB(A) (G(A), X) = 0 for all i > 0 and X ∈ I(B(A))<∞ , Thus G′ is exact on
I(B(A))<∞ . One now completes the proof using the same arguments as in Lemma 28.
                                                                  opp                              opp )
    After Theorem 29 we can define N ∗ = D(N (B(A) ) ) and H ∗ = D(H (B(A)                                 ). With
this notation we have the following images of the two-step duality functor G.

                                                      23
Proposition 32. For every λ ∈ Λ we have
         G(H(λ)) = I (B(A)) (λ),      G(N(λ)) = ∇(B(A)) (λ),          G(T (λ)) = C (B(A)) (λ)
                 G(∆(λ)) = (N ∗ )(B(A)) (λ),              G(P (λ)) = (H ∗ )(B(A)) (λ).
Proof. The first three equalities were proved during the proof of Theorem 29. The fourth
equality follows from the third one and the fact that G is exact on P(A)<∞ by induction
on λ, which starts from that λ for which T (λ) = ∆(λ). The fifth equality follows from the
fourth one and the fact that G is exact on P(A)<∞ by induction on λ, which starts from
that λ for which P (λ) = ∆(λ).
   We would like to end this section with the following two remarks: firstly, the Ringel and
the two-step dualities give rise to the following schematic picture of functors on module
categories of SSS-algebras:

Note that the picture above is not a commutative diagram. In particular, the two-step
duality functor G is not the composition of the Ringel dualities F and F R . Each functor on
this picture induces an equivalence of certain subcategories. However, these subcategories
are not well-coordinated with each other. A deeper understanding of the picture above
might be an interesting problem.
    Secondly, in Section 3 we have shown that the information about the proper stratifi-
cation of the Ringel dual of an SSS-algebra, A, can be derived directly from A−mod. An
interesting problem seems to be whether A−mod contains enough information to answer
directly the question about the proper stratification of the the two-step dual.


8    F(N )-filtration dimension
Recall (see for example [MO, Section 4.2]) that for an algebra, A, a family, M, of A-
modules, and an A-module, M, one says that the M-filtration codimension codimM (M)
of M equals n provided that there exists an exact sequence,
                         0 → M → M0 → M1 → · · · → Mn → 0,
where Mi ∈ M, and n is minimal with this property. In this section we study the F (N)-
filtration codimension for A-modules. We start with determining the modules for which
the notion of F (N)-filtration codimension makes sense.

                                                     24
Lemma 33. Let M ∈ A−mod. Then codimF (N ) (M) is defined and finite if and only if
p.d.(M) < ∞.

Proof. The “if” part follows from Proposition 14 and the fact that H ∈ F (N).
   To prove the “only if” part, we take a finite F (N)-coresolution,

                            0 → M → X0 → X1 → · · · → Xl → 0,                            (25)

of M. From Lemma 7 it follows that all Xi have finite projective dimension, which implies
that M has finite projective dimension as well.

Theorem 34. Let M be an A-module of finite projective dimension. Then

                              codimF (N ) (M) = codimF (∇) (M).

Proof. Since F (N) ⊂ F (∇) it follows directly that codimF (∇) (M) ≤ codimF (N ) (M). To
prove that codimF (N ) (M) ≤ codimF (∇) (M), we let (25) to be an F (N)-coresolution of M
                          •
of minimal length and NM     be the corresponding complex, whose only non-zero homology
is in degree zero and equals M. Applying Lemma 39 to A = Aopp , X (A) = D(⊕li=0 Xl ),
Y (A) = D(T ) and the complex D(NM  •                                 •
                                      [l]) gives a complex, the dual ZM of which belongs to
  b                                         •
K (add(T )) and is quasi-isomorphic to NM [l].
    From a tilting coresolution of ∆ we get the complex

                    J∆• :     · · · → 0 → Q0 → Q1 → · · · → Qr → 0 . . .

in Kb (add(T )), in which Q0 is isomorphic to the characteristic tilting module T , and whose
only non-zero homology is in degree zero and equals ∆.
                                         0                                0
   Let T (λ) be a direct summand of ZM       6= 0 and f : T ։ T (λ) ֒→ ZM    be the projection
on this direct summand. By [MO, Lemma 1] the homomorphism f gives rise to a non-zero
homomorphism in D b (A) from J∆• to ZM  •
                                           . The last implies that ExtlA (∆, M) 6= 0 and from
[MP, Lemma 1] we obtain that codimF (∇) (M) ≥ l. This completes the proof.


9     Examples
9.1    Quasi-hereditary algebras
Assume that A is quasi-hereditary (or, more generally, a properly stratified algebra, for
which the characteristic tilting and cotilting modules coincide). Then the tilting A-module
T is also cotilting and hence there is an epimorphism, T ։ ∇, whose kernel is filtered by
costandard modules. In this situation Lemma 1 implies that N = ∇ and hence H = I.
Thus, in this case we get that B(A) is Morita equivalent to A. Moreover, the two-step
duality functor G is isomorphic to the identity functor.

The dimension of B(A) is 7, while the dimension of A is 11. Since both algebras are basic,
it follows that A and B(A)opp are neither isomorphic nor Morita equivalent.

9.3    A properly stratified algebra with duality whose two-step
       dual is not properly stratified
This example presents a properly stratified algebra (A, ≤) having a simple preserving
duality, ◦ , whose Ringel dual (R, ≤R ) is properly stratified, does not have any simple
preserving duality and such that the two-step dual algebra B(A) is not properly stratified.
   Let A be the quotient of the path algebra of the following quiver
                                                                                           γ

modulo the relations γ 2 = δ 2 = γδ = δγ = αβ = 0. We set Λ = {1 < 2}. The algebra
A is isomorphic to the opposite algebra via the antiautomorphism ι : A → A, defined by
ι(ei ) = ei , i = 1, 2, ι(α) = β, ι(β) = α, ι(γ) = δ, ι(δ) = γ. Since ι stabilizes the primitive
idempotents, it induces a simple preserving duality for A.

the proper standard module ∆(λ), λ = 1, 2, look as follows:

This algebra is properly stratified with respect to the opposite order 2 <R 1 on Λ.
Further it is easy to get the following equalities: dimk Ext1R (L(R) (1), L(R) (2)) = 2 and
dimk Ext1R (L(R) (2), L(R) (1)) = 1 and hence R does not have any simple preserving duality.

One immediately sees that B(A)opp is an SSS-algebra, while B(A) is not (since the trace of
P (B(A)) (2) in P (B(A)) (1) is not a direct sum of several copies of P (B(A)) (2)). In particular,
B(A) is neither properly stratified nor has a simple preserving duality.

9.4    Stratified algebras associated with Harish-Chandra bimod-
       ules
Let g be a semi-simple finite dimensional complex Lie algebra, U(g) be its universal envelop-
ing algebra and Z(g) be the center of U(g). Denote by H the category of all Harish-Chandra
g-bimodules, that is finitely generated g-bimodules, which are direct sums of finite dimen-
sional g-modules under the adjoint action of g. Fix a positive integer n and two maximal
ideals χ and ξ of Z(g). Suppose for simplicity that χ and ξ correspond to regular central
characters and denote by χ Hξn the full subcategory in H which consists of all bimodules M
satisfying Mξ n = 0 and χm M = 0, m ≫ 0. We refer the reader to [Ja, Kapitel 6] and [So]
for details. It is well-known, see for example [So, Section 5], that χ Hξn is equivalent to the
module category of some finite dimensional associative algebra A. In [Ma, Section 5.6] it
was shown that A is properly stratified. At the same time, if rank(g) > 1 and n > 1, it is
easy to see that the cotilting modules for A have infinite projective dimension and hence
are not tilting modules.
     However, using the translation functors one can easily show that the Ringel dual of
A is properly stratified. The simple bimodules in χ Hξn are indexed by the elements of
the Weyl group W , see [Ja, Kapitel 6]. Let w0 be the longest element in W . Consider
the tilting bimodule T (w0) corresponding to w0 . Then all tilting bimodules in χ Hξn are
direct summands of F ⊗ T (w0 ) for some finite dimensional g-module F . Let us construct
the bimodules N(w), w ∈ W , inductively. Set N(w0 ) = T (w0 ), and for w ∈ W and a
simple reflection s such that the length of sw is smaller than the length of w, let N(sw)
be the cokernel of the adjunction morphism from N(w) to θs (N(w)), where θs denotes the
translation functor through the s-wall. It is easy to see that this adjunction morphism is
always injective in the situation above. Using the standard properties of the translation
functors and the fact that all tilting bimodules are obtained by translating T (w0 ), we obtain
that all tilting bimodules are filtered by N(w), w ∈ W . This implies that the Ringel dual
R of A is properly stratified.
     In fact, using Arkhipov’s functor, [Ar], one can show that R is isomorphic to A. Iter-
ating this we also obtain A ∼  = B(A). However, in this case the two-step duality functor
is quite far from being trivial, because the injective A-modules have infinite projective
dimension in general. In fact, the two-step duality functor does something remarkable,
namely, it defines a covariant equivalence between the categories of P(A)<∞ and I(A)<∞ .
That these two categories are contravariantly equivalent follows from the existence of a
simple preserving duality for A (the last comes from the equivalence of χ Hξn with a block
                                                                                <∞
of the thick category O, [So,
                             Theorem 3]). In particular, the category P(A)         happens to
                          <∞ opp
be equivalent to P(A)            . Obviously, this gives us a contravariant equivalence from
P(A)<∞ to itself, which sends P to H. In particular, from Proposition 24 it follows that
the finitistic dimension of χ Hξn equals twice the projective dimension of the characteristic
tilting module in χ Hξn .

9.5    A tensor construction for properly stratified algebras
In this section we present one general construction of properly stratified algebras using
quasi-hereditary and local algebras. In this way one obtains a huge family of stratified
algebras, moreover, there is an easy criterion when all tilting modules over such algebras
are cotilting. In fact, this happens to be the case if and only if the local algebra we start
from is self-injective. Thus this gives us a possibility of constructing series of properly
stratified algebras for which tilting and cotilting modules do not coincide, hence showing
that the two-step duality we worked out is not that rare.
    We remark that any local algebra is properly stratified with simple proper standard
and costandard modules, projective standard modules and injective costandard modules.
    Throughout this subsection we fix a quasi-hereditary algebra, (A, ≤), with Λ being
an index set for the isomorphism classes of simple A-modules. Let further B be a fixed
local algebra and consider the algebra D = A ⊗k B. Since B is local, Λ also indexes the
isomorphism classes of simple D-modules in a natural way. Note that we have the following:
               (A)                  (A)
∆(A) (λ) = ∆ (λ), ∇(A) (λ) = ∇ (λ) for all λ. Moreover, P (B) = ∆(B) , I (B) = ∇(B) ,
  (B)     (B)
∆ = ∇ = L(B) .
Proposition 35. The algebra (D, ≤) is properly stratified. Moreover, for each λ ∈ Λ we
have
              X (D) (λ) = X (A) (λ)⊗k X (B) , where X ∈ {∆, ∆, ∇, ∇}.
Proof. Let λ ∈ Λ. Then we obtain
                    P (D) (λ) = D(eλ ⊗k 1B ) = Aeλ ⊗k B1B = P (λ)⊗k P (B) ,
where the idempotent eλ ∈ A is chosen such that P (A) (λ) = Aeλ . The functor − ⊗k P (B) :
A-mod → D-mod is exact (as the tensor product over a field) and if we apply − ⊗k P (B) to
the short exact sequence
                           0 → K (A) → P (A) (λ) → ∆(A) (λ) → 0,

where K (A) has a filtration with subquotients ∆(A) (µ), µ > λ, we obtain the short exact
sequence
                    0 → K (A) ⊗k P (B) → P (D) (λ) → ∆(A) (λ)⊗k P (B) → 0,
where, using the exactness of − ⊗k P (B) , K (A) ⊗k P (B) has a filtration with subquotients
∆(A) (µ)⊗k P (B) , µ > λ. Exactness of − ⊗k P (B) , L(A) (ν)⊗k− , ν ∈ Λ, and the equality
L(D) (µ) = L(A) (µ) ⊗k L(B) also implies that [∆(A) (λ)⊗k P (B) : L(D) (µ)] = 0 for µ > λ.
Therefore we conclude that the property (SS) holds for A ⊗k B.
   To show that (PS) holds, apply the exact functor ∆(A) (λ)⊗k− : B-mod → D-mod to the
short exact sequence
                               0 → K (B) → P (B) → L(B) → 0,
where K (B) has a filtration with simple subquotients L(B) , and obtain
               0 → ∆(A) (λ)⊗k K (B) → ∆(A) (λ)⊗k P (B) → ∆(A) (λ)⊗k L(B) → 0,

                                              32
where ∆(A) (λ) ⊗ K (B) has a filtration with subquotients ∆(A) (λ)⊗k L(B) . We conclude that
property (PS) holds. By dual arguments it follows that I (D) (λ) = I (A) (λ)⊗k I (B) has a
filtration with subquotients ∇(D) = ∇(A) ⊗k ∇(B) , and ∇(D) has a filtration with subquotients
   (D)
∇ = ∇(A) ⊗k L(B) . Hence the lemma is proved.
   As an immediate corollary we obtain:

Corollary 36. The module ∆(D) is projective and the module ∇(D) is injective if viewed
as B-module.

Corollary 37. We have:

  1. T (D) (λ) = T (A) (λ)⊗k T (B) = T (A) (λ)⊗k P (B) ;

  2. C (D) (λ) = C (A) (λ)⊗k C (B) = T (A) (λ)⊗k I (B) .

Proof. Follows from Proposition 35 and exactness of the functors − ⊗k P (B) and − ⊗k I (B) .
   And, finally, we can formulate our main result in this section:

Corollary 38. The tilting modules for D are cotilting if and only if B is self-injective.

Proof. Since D is properly stratified, we have that T (D) = C (D) is equivalent to C (D) ∈
F (∆(D) ). By Lemma 15 the last is equivalent to p.d.(C (D) ) < ∞. From Corollary 36
and the fact that D is properly stratified we get that all projective D-modules are also
projective as B-modules.
   Thus p.d.(C (D) ) < ∞ implies that C (D) is a B-module of finite projective dimension,
hence projective as B is local. But from Corollary 36 it also follows that C (D) is B injective
and hence B is self-injective.
   On the other hand, Corollary 37 implies that, when B is self-injective, then

         T (D) = T (A) ⊗k T (B) = T (A) ⊗k P (B) = C (A) ⊗k I (B) = C (A) ⊗k C (B) = C (D) .

This completes the proof.


10      Appendix: Two technical lemmas
In this appendix we prove two auxiliary technical lemmas similar to [MO, Lemma 4], which
were used in the paper.

Lemma 39. Let A be a finite-dimensional associative k-algebra, X (A) be a A-module, and
Y (A) be a (generalized) (co)tilting A-module. Assume that X (A) has a finite coresolution by
modules from add(Y (A) ). Let X • be a positive complex in K(add(X (A) )). Then there is a
positive complex, Y • , in K(add(Y (A) )) such that X • is quasi-isomorphic to Y • . Moreover,
if X • ∈ Kb (add(X (A) )), then Y • ∈ Kb (add(Y (A) )).


                                                   33
Proof. Let
                                                                         (A)               (A)
                              X• :                      · · · → 0 → X0 → X1 → . . .
be a positive complex in K(add(X (A) )) and put Xj• = tj X • . We will show by induction
that for each j ≥ 0 there exist a complex, Yj• ∈ K(add(Y (A) )), and a quasi-isomorphism,
Φj : Xj• → Yj• . Moreover, we will choose the family {Yj• }j≥0 such that for all k < j we
have tk Yj• = tk Yk• .
             (A)
    Since Xi ∈ add(X (A) ) for all i we can choose by our assumptions a coresolution,
                          (A)                                 (A)
Zi• ∈ K(add(Y (A) )), of Xi , and a quasi-isomorphism, ϕi : (Xi )• → Yi• . In the case j = 0
we put Y0• = Z0• and we are done.
                                                                                •        •
    Now suppose by induction that there exists a quasi-isomorphism, Φj−1 : Xj−1     → Yj−1 .
                      (A)    (A)
The map dj−1 : Xj−1 → Xj induces the distinguished triangle
                             d•j−1            (A)
                         •
                        Xj−1 −→ (Xj )• [−j + 1] → Cone(d•j−1) → Xj−1
                                                                 •
                                                                     [1],
and we have Cone(d•j−1) = Xj• [1].
    Using ExtA (Y (A) , Y (A) ) = 0 and [Ha, Chap.III, Lemma 2.1] we can choose a representa-
            •
tive, ψj : Yj−1 → Zj• [−j + 1], in K(add(Y (A) )) of the composition ϕj [−j + 1] ◦ d•j−1 ◦ Φ−1
                                                                                            j−1
(in D b (A-mod)). This gives us a diagram in D b(A-mod), which can be completed to the
following commutative diagram:
                          d•j−1
                  •                        (A)
                 Xj−1             /   (Xj )• [−j + 1]                      /   Xj• [1]               /    •
                                                                                                         Xj−1 [1]
                  ≀ Φj−1                         ≀ ϕj [−j+1]                          Φj                         Φj−1 [1]
                             ψj
                                                                                                           
                  •
                 Yj−1                  /   Zj• [−j + 1]              /   Cone(ψj )               /        •
                                                                                                         Yj−1 [1].

Since both Φj−1 and ϕj [−j + 1] are isomorphisms the morphism Φj is an isomorphism too.
Hence we get the quasi-isomorphism Φj : Xj• → Cone(ψj )[−1], where Cone(ψj )[−1] is a
positive complex in Kb (add(Y (A) )) with the property tj−1 Cone(ψj )[−1] = tj−1Yj−1 •
                                                                                        . Set
  •
Yj = Cone(ψj )[−1] and the induction follows.
    Define the limit complex Y • ∈ K(add(Y (A) )) by tj Y • = tj Yj• for all j ≥ 0 (that for
all k < j we have tk Yj• = tk Yk• , guarantees that Y • is well-defined). Moreover, we have a
quasi-isomorphism Φ : Y • → X • . Hence the general statement is true and we see by the
construction that Y • is bounded, whenever X • is.
Lemma 40. Let A be a finite-dimensional associative algebra, X (A) be a A-module and Y (A)
be a (generalized) (co)tilting A-module. Assume that X (A) admits a (possibly infinite) resolu-
tion by modules from add(Y (A) ). Then for every negative complex X • ∈ Kb (add(X (A) )) there
exists a (possibly infinite) negative complex, Y • ∈ K(add(Y (A) )), which is quasi-isomorphic
to X • .
Proof. The statement is proved by induction analogous to that used in the previous lemma.
Moreover, since we start with a finite complex from the very beginning, no truncation is
needed. We leave the details out.

                                                                34
