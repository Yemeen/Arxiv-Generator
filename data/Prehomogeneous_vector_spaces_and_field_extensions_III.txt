Introduction
   Throughout this paper, k is a eld of characteristic zero, and k is its algebraic
closure. We rst recall the denition of prehomogeneous vector spaces.
Denition (0.1) Let G be a connected reductive group, V a representation of
G, and  a non-trivial character of G, all dened k. Then (G; V; ) is called a
prehomogeneous vector space if it satises the following properties.
(1) There exists a Zariski open orbit.
(2) There exists a polynomial (x) 2 k[V ] such that (gx) = (g)a(x) for a
certain positive integer a.
   Such  is called a relative invariant polynomial. We dene V ss = fx 2 V j
(x) 6= 0g and call it the set of semi-stable points. If (G; V; ) is an irreducible
representation, the choice of  is essentially unique and we may write (G; V ) as
well. For x 2 Vkss , let Gx be the stabilizer and G0x its connected component of 1.
   The orbit space Gk n Vkss for prehomogeneous vector spaces usually parametrizes
interesting arithmetic objects and has been considered by many people. For exam-
ple Gauss [1] considered the space of binary quadratic forms to investigate ideal
classes of quadratic elds. Igusa [3] investigated spinors of dimension up to twelve,
and these cases turned out to be special cases of prehomogeneous vector spaces.
Later Igusa [4] formulated the problem in terms of Galois cohomology, and this
formulation was used to parametrize eld extensions of degree up to ve in [11].
   Let W = k7 be the standard representation of GL(7) (i.e., the space of seven
dimensional column vectors), and e1 ;    ; e7 the standard coordinate vectors. We
use the notation eijk = ei ^ ej ^ ek , etc. We consider the natural representation of
GL(7) on ^3 W . Let
                     w = e234 + e567 + e1 ^ (e25 + e36 + e47 ) 2 ^3 W:
We dene G1 to be the set of g 2 GL(7) such that gw = c(g)w for some c(g) 2
GL(1). Then G1 becomes a closed subgroup of GL(7), and c : G1 ! GL(1) is a
character of G both dened over k.
  In this paper, we consider the following two prehomogeneous vector spaces

(2) G = G1  GL(2); V = W 
 k2 .
Denition (0.2) Exi is the set of isomorphism classes of Galois extensions of k
which are splitting elds of degree i equations.
   In x1, we recall the relation between the orbit space Gk n Vkss and Galois coho-
mology. In xx2,3, we construct a natural map V : Gk n Vkss ! Ex2 for cases (1),
(2) and prove that V is surjective. For case (2), let Te = Ker(G ! GL(V )). In
x4 (Theorems (4.4), (4.13)), we determine the ber structure of V and prove the
following theorem.
Theorem (0.3) (1) For case (1), the map V is bijective. Moreover, if x 2 Vkss
corresponds to a quadratic extension k()=k with 2 2 k, G0x    = SU(2; 1).
(2) For case (2), V 1 (k) consists of a single orbit, and if k()=k is a quadratic
extension with 2 2 k, V 1 (k())   = (Z=2Z) n k =Nk()=k (k() ) where Z=2Z acts
on k =Nk()=k (k() ) by s ! s 1 . Moreover, if x 2 V 1 (k()) corresponds
                                                                            s to
s 2 k , G0x =Te is the unitary group associated with the Hermitian matrix       1 .
   For the denition of SU (2; 1), see Denition (2.13). Note that if two non-
degenerate Hermitian matrices are scalar multiples of each other, the corresponding
unitary groups are the same. Therefore, we can conclude that case (2) parametrizes
all the two dimensional unitary groups over all the quadratic extensions of the
ground eld.
   There may be two kinds of applications of results in this paper in the future. One
is of course the zeta function theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. The above
theorem says that the zeta function for these cases is the counting function for
quadratic elds weighted with the Tamagawa number (without the normalization)
of the group SU(2; 1) for case (1) and the Tamagawa number of two dimensional
unitary groups. The other is an analogue of the Oppenheim conjecture for preho-
mogeneous vector spaces. For the zeta function theory, the reader should see [13].
For an analogue of the Oppenheim conjecture, the reader should see [12].
x1 Rational orbits and the Galois cohomology
   In this section we recall the relation between Galois cohomology and the set of
rational orbits in prehomogeneous vector spaces.
   We rst recall the denition of Galois cohomology. Let G be an algebraic group
over k, and k0 =k a nite Galois extension. A 1{cocycle is a function h = fh g
from Gal(k0 =k) to Gk0 (h is the value of h at  2 Gal(k0 =k)) satisfying the cocycle
condition h  = h h for all 1 ; 2. If h = fh g; i = fi g are 1{cocycles,
             1 2      2
                          2

they are equivalent if there exists g 2 Gk0 such that h = g 1i g for all . This
                          1



denes an equivalence relation and H1 (k0 =k; G) is the set of equivalence classes. Let
g 2 Gk0 . We use the notation g for the 1{cocycle h = fh g dened by h = g 1g
for all  2 Gal(k0 =k). The cohomology class dened by g does not depend on the
choice of g and we denote this element by 1.
   We dene H1 (k; G) to be the projective limit of H1 (k0 =k; G) for all the nite
Galois extensions k0 . An equivalent denition is to consider continuous func-
                                          2
tions fh g from Gal(k=k) to Gk satisfying the same cocycle condition. We dene
H0(k0 =k; G) = H0 (k; G) = Gk . If G is an abelian group, Hn (k0 =k; G) can be dened
for all n and has a structure of an abelian group also.
   Let
(1:1)                            1 ! G1 ! G2 ! G3 ! 1
be a short exact sequence of algebraic groups over k. This means that G1 is a
normal subgroup of G2 , the kernel of G2 ! G3 is G1 , and G2k ! G3k is surjective.
If G1 ; G2; G3 are abelian and (1.1) is exact, the usual long exact sequence holds.
   Let g 2 G3k . If k0 =k is a large enough nite Galois extension, there is an element
f 2 G2k0 which maps to g. For a cohomology class c in H1 (k; G1) dened by a 1{
cocycle h = fh g, we dene gc 2 H1(k; G1) to be the class dened by the 1{cocycle
ffh (f  ) 1 g. It is known that this denes an action of G3k on H1 (k; G1). The
following lemma is an easy consequence of Proposition 38, x5.5 and Corollaire 1,
x5.5 of [9].
Lemma (1.2) The sequence
                     1 ! G3k n H1 (k; G1) ! H1 (k; G2) ! H1(k; G3)
is exact. Moreover, if (1.1) is split, the last map is surjective.
    Note that the exactness of the sequence in (1.2) means that the inverse image of
1 2 H1 (k; G3) is G3k n H1 (k; G1).
    It is a familiar fact that both H1 (k; GL(n)) and H1 (k; SL(n)) are trivial. Let
k0 =k be a nite extension. Then as remarked in [9] (see the proof of Theoreme 1,
x2.2) one has
                               H1 (k1; G) = H1 (k; Rk =k (G))
                                                  1

for any algebraic group G over k1 , where Rk =k denotes restriction of scalars. This
                                              1
leads at once to the following.
Lemma (1.3) Let k1 =k be a nite extension, and G = GL(n)k or SL(n)k consid-
                                                                 1           1
ered as an algebraic group over k. Then H1 (k; G) = f1g.
    Let (G; V ) be an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space. For x 2 Vkss, let
gx be the stabilizer and G0x be the connected component of 1. Since Gx is an
algebraic group over k, Gx =G0x is a nite algebraic group. Let Si be the group of
permutations of f1;    ; ig. In the following we make the following assumption.
Assumption (1.4) There exists an element w 2 Vkss and i such that
(1) Gal(k=k) acts on Gw =G0w trivially,
(2) Gw =G0w  = Si ,
(3) the sequence (1.1) splits for G1 = G0w ; G2 = Gw ; G3 = Si .
    All the prehomogeneous vector spaces in [11] and [5] satisfy this assumption. For
prehomogeneous vector spaces in this paper, we prove this assumption in xx2,3.
    For the rest of this section, we assume Assumption (1.4). With this assumption,
we have the following exact sequence
(1:5)            1 ! Si n H1 (k; G0w ) ! H1 (k; Gw ) ! H1 (k; Si) ! 1:
                                          3
We denote the surjective map H1(k; Gw ) ! H1(k; Si) by V . The set H1(k; Si) can
be identied with the set of conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from Gal(k=k)
to Si. The kernel of the homomorphism determines a eld which belongs to Exi .
This denes a map H1 (k; Si) ! Exi . Let V be the composition of V and the
map H1 (k; Si) ! Exi . If i = 1; 2; 3 (i = 2 for prehomogeneous vector spaces in this
paper), H1 (k; Si) 
                   = Exi , and the maps V and V can be identied.
   If x 2 Vkss, we can choose a nite Galois extension k0 =k and g 2 Gk0 such that
x = gw. Then cx = fg 1g g determines an element of Ker(H1 (k; Gw ) ! H1 (k; G))
(which is the set of elements which map to 1 2 H1(k; G)). The following theorem
(which does not require Assumption (1.4)) is due to Igusa [4].
Theorem (1.6) (Igusa) The correspondence
                 Gk n Vxss 3 x ! cx 2 Ker(H1 (k; Gw ) ! H1 (k; G))
is bijective.
    By the above theorem, we can consider Gk n Vkss as a subset of H1 (k; Gw ). We
denote the restriction of V ; V to Gk n Vkss also by V ; V .
    Let x 2 Vkss. We choose an element gx 2 Gk so that x = gx w. Then for
each element c 2 H1 (k; Gw ) dened by a 1{cocycle fh g, we can associate an
element cgx 2 H1 (k; Gx ) dened by a 1{cocycle fgx h (gx ) 1 g. Note that since
(gx ) 1 gx 2 Gw (but may not be in G0w ),
                        gxh (gx ) 1 = gx (h (gx ) 1 gx)gx 1 2 Gxk :
It is easy to see that the map H1 (k; Gw ) 3 c ! cgx 2 H1 (k; Gx) is well dened and
does not depend on the choice of gx . Also a similar construction using gx 1 denes
a map from H1(k; Gx ) to H1 (k; Gw ). So c ! cgx is a bijective map.
   Let x 2 Vkss. By the exact sequence
(1:7)                         1 ! G0x ! Gx ! Gx =G0x ! 1
and Lemma (1.2), (Gx =G0x )k n H1(k; G0x ) can be considered as a subset of H1 (k; Gx),
which corresponds bijectively with H1 (k; Gw ). It is easy to see that c 2 H1 (k; Gw )
maps to the trivial element of H1(k; G) if and only if cgx 2 H1 (k; Gx) maps to the
trivial element of H1(k; G) by the imbedding Gx  G. So cohomology classes in
(Gx =G0x )k n H1 (k; G0x) which correspond to rational orbits are those in
                        Ker((Gx =G0x )k n H1 (k; G0x) ! H1 (k; G)):
   The proof of Lemma (1.12) [5] works for the following Lemma also and we do
not repeat the proof here. Note that k = ksep because we assumed ch k = 0. We
used the notation V here instead of V in [5] for the map Gk n Vkss ! H1 (k; Si)
because there is a slight dierence between H1(k; Si) and Exi if i  4, but that was
not the case in [5] because i = 2; 3 in [5].
Lemma (1.8) (1) If x 2 Vkss,
             V 1(V (Gk x)) 
                             = Ker((Gx =G0x )k n H1(k; G0x ) ! H1 (k; G)):
                                          4
(2) By this identication, the cohomology class fg 1g g 2 H1 (k; G0x) (g 2 Gk )
corresponds to the orbit Gk gx.
x2 The orbit space Gk n Vkss (1)
   Let G1 ; W; c, etc., be as in the introduction. In this section, we consider the
prehomogeneous vector space G = G1 ; V = W . We prove that V for this case
is a map to Ex2 and construct a subset of Gk n Vkss which maps bijectively to Ex2 .
Also for each point x in this set, we determine the stabilizer Gx .
   Let x = t (x1 ;    ; x7) be the coordinate of x 2 V with respect to fe1 ;    ; e7g.
It is known (see [8, p. 135]) that (G; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space and
(2:1)                       (x) = x21 4(x2x5 + x3 x6 + x4 x7 )
is a relative invariant polynomial. It is proved in [10] that V  can be considered
as the imaginary part of the split octonion algebra (which is also called the split
Cayley algebra). By , we can identify V with V  and we can regard  as a
function on V  . The resulting function on V  turns out to be a scalar multiplication
of the restriction of the norm form of the octonion algebra to the imaginary part.
Moreover, if ff1 ;    ; f7g is the dual basis of fe1 ;    ; e7g and y = y1f1 +    + y7 f7 ,
(y) = y12 (y2y5 + y3 y6 + y4 y7).
    If k is algebraically closed, c is set-theoretically surjective and the kernel of c is
a semi-simple group of type G2 which is connected modulo scalar matrices (for the
second part, see [8, p. 85]). So G is a connected reductive group over any ground
eld k of characteristic zero. If (gx) = (g)(x), c(tI7 ) = t3 ; (tI7 ) = t2 . Since
c;  are rational characters, so is 0 = c 1 and 0 (tI7) = t. Since G is connected
and dim G=[G; G] = 1, the group of rational characters is generated by one element.
Therefore, c = 0 3;  = 0 2.
    Let w = t ( 1 0    0 ). Then w 2 Vkss because (w) = 1 6= 0. It is proved
in [8, p. 134] that the Lie algebra of G0w is

                                                                          c2 A3 A4
for a 2 M(1; 1); b1; b2 2 M(1; 3); c1 ; c2 2 M(3; 1); A1;    ; A4 2 M(3; 3). Let
              F = fg(a; b; c; A) 2 G j a = 1; b = 0; c = 0; A2 = A3 = 0g:
Then F is clearly a closed subset of G. For A 2 SL(3), let
(2:3)                        d(A) = g(1; 0; 0; 0; 0; A; 0; tA 1 ; 0):
                                                    5
   It is easy to see that if g(a; b; c; A) 2 F , A1t A4 is a scalar matrix, say dI3 , and
det A1 = det A4 = d. This implies that det A1 = det A4 = d = 1. Therefore, we get
the following lemma.
Lemma (2.4) F = fd(A) j A 2 SL(3)g.
   The above lemma implies that SL(3) is a closed subgroup of G by the imbedding
A ! d(A). Clearly, elements of the form d(A) x the point w. Since SL(3) is
connected, SL(3)  G0w is a closed subgroup. Since they have the same Lie algebra,
G0wk = SL(3)k (see [2]). Therefore, by Lemma 2 [6, p. 8], SL(3) = G0w as algebraic
groups over k. In particular, SL(3) is a normal subgroup of Gw .
   Let
                        01                  1      01          1
(2:5)                 =@ 1                 A;  = @          A:
                                        1                 

Proposition (2.6) The subgroup Gw is generated by Gw = SL(3) and  .
                                                              0


Proof. We may assume that k is algebraically closed by Lemma 2 [6, p. 8] again.
Note that  2 = 1 and  induces an outer automorphism of SL(3) by conjugation.
This implies that conjugations by elements of the group generated by G0w and
 exhaust all the automorphisms of SL(3). Let g 2 Gw . Then by the above
observation, multiplying an element of SL(3) and  if necessary, we may assume
that g commutes with elements of SL(3).
   We dene
(2:7)               U0 = he1 i; U1 = he2 ; e3; e4 i; U2 = he5 ; e6; e7i
(h i means the span). Then U0 is the trivial representation of SL(3), U1 is the
standard representation of SL(3), and U2 is the dual of U1 . As representations of
SL(3), V = U0  U1  U2 , and U0 ; U1; U2 are inequivalent representations of SL(3).
Since g commutes with elements of G0w , g(Ui)  Ui for i = 0; 1; 2 and by Schur's
lemma, g must be of the form g(a; 0; 0; 0; 0; bI3; 0; cI3; 0). It is easy to verify that
this element xes w if and only if a = b = c = 1. This proves the proposition. 
   By the above proposition, we have a split exact sequence
(2:8)                      1 ! SL(3) ! Gw ! Z=2Z ! 1;
where  maps to the non-trivial element of Z=2Z.
   Because of the split exact sequence (2.8), H1(k; Z=2Z) = Ex2 can be considered
as a subset of H (k; Gw ).
                1


Lemma (2.9) The map Ex2 ! H1 (k; G) is trivial.
Proof. The eld k as the degree one extension of k corresponds to the trivial class of
H1(k; Z=2Z) and the lemma is trivial for this case. Let k()=k be a quadratic exten-
sion such that  2= k and 2 2 k. Let  be the non-trivial element of Gal(k()=k).

Proof. Let R be any k{algebra. Consider R() as above with the action of .
Regarding Gw  GL(7), we consider the entry-wise action of  for elements in
G0w R() also. Then
                        G0w R = fg 2 G0w R() j g = gg:
   Over R(), we can express elements of G0w R() as gd(A)g 1 where A 2
SL(3)R(). This element is in G0w R if and only if
                          gd(A)g 1 = g d(A )(g ) 1
                                      = g d(A )g 1
                                      = g d(A 1 )g 1:
This condition is satised if and only if A 2 SU (2; 1)R. Therefore, the proposition
follows from Theorem [7, p. 17]. 
x3 The orbit space Gk n Vkss (2)
   In this section, we consider case (2) in the introduction. Let G1 ; W; c, etc. be
as in the introduction, and  as in x2. We dene the prehomogeneous vector space
(2) more precisely rst.
   Let G2 = GL(2), and G = G1  G2 . Let V = W 
 k2 and we consider this space
as the set of linear forms x = M (v) in two variables v = (v1 ; v2) with entries in W .
Let W1 = v1 W be the subspace of forms x = M (v) such that M (0; v2) = 0. We
dene W2 = v2 W similarly. Then W = W1  W2 .
   We dene an action of g = (g1; g2) 2 G on x = M (v) by gx = g1M (vg2). This
denes a representation of G on V . Let fe1 ;    ; e7 g be the standard basis of W .
Considering V = v1 W  v2 W , let ei;j = vi ej for i = 1; 2; j = 1;    ; 7. Then
fei;j j i = 1; 2; j = 1;    ; 7g is a basis of V . Let x = (xi;j ) be the coordinate of
x 2 V with respect to this basis. We may also use the notation x = (x1; x2) where
xi = t ( xi;1    xi;7 ) for i = 1; 2.
   Let Te = Ker(G ! GL(V ). Then
                       Te = f(t 1I7 ; tI2) j t 2 GL(1)g 
                                                        = GL(1);
and Te is contained in the center of G.

   Let  be as in (2.1). For x = (x1; x2) 2 V , we dene

This is a binary quadratic form. It is easy to see that if g = (g1; g2) 2 G,
                                Fgx(v) = (g1 )Fx (vg2):
Therefore, the discriminant of Fx (v) is a relative invariant polynomial. Note that
Fw (v) = 4v1 v2 . So w 2 Vkss.

in x2.)
Proposition (3.5) The subgroup Gw is generated by G0w = GL(2)  Te and  .
Proof. As in x2, we may assume that k is algebraically closed. Suppose U is an
irreducible representation of GL(2). Then          two integers k; l such that the
                                        tthere0 exist
highest weight of elements of the form 0 t 1 is tk and t2 I2 acts by tl2 . Note
that k  0. Since U is determined by k; l, we say U is of type (k; l).
   Let
(3:6)               Ui;0 = hei;1i; Ui;1 = hei;2 i; Ui;2 = hei;3 ; ei;4i;
                    Ui;3 = hei;5i; Ui;4 = hei;6 ; ei;7i
for i = 1; 2.
   Suppose g = (g1; g2) 2 Gw . Then Fw (vg2) is a scalar multiple of Fw (v). Multi-
plying  if necessary, we may assume that ( 1 0 ) g2; ( 0 1 ) g2 are scalar multiples
                                              9
of ( 1 0 ) ; ( 0 1 ) respectively. This implies g2 is a diagonal element and com-
mutes with d2 (A) for any A 2 GL(2).
    Since g normalizes GL(2)  Te, the conjugation by g maps the center of GL(2)  Te
to itself. Since Te is contained in the center of G, the conjugation by g1 induces
either the identity map or the inverse on the center of GL(2)  G1 (imbedded by
d1 ) modulo Te. Since g2 commutes with d1(A) for any A 2 GL(2), g1 must induce
the identity map on the center of GL(2)  G1 modulo Te. Therefore, g commutes
with the center of GL(2)  G modulo Te.
    Since g2 is diagonal, g(W1) = W1; g(W2) = W2. Note that Te acts trvially on V .
So by the above consideration, g does not change the weights with respect to tI2
of elements in W1 . The types of U1;j for j = 0;    ; 4 are
                          (0; 2); (0; 0); (1; 3); (0; 4); (1; 1):
Therefore, g1 must be of the form
                            0a                                  1

x4 The ber structure of V
   We consider the ber structure of V for prehomogeneous vector spaces (1),
(2) in this section. In both cases, V is a map to Ex2 , there is a point w 2 Vkss
which corresponds to the trivial extension k=k, and G0w    = SL(3) or GL(2)  GL(1).
Since H (k; SL(3)) = H (k; GL(2)  GL(1)) = f1g, V (k) = Gk w in both cases by

Lemma (1.8).
   Let k()=k be a quadratic extension such that 2 2 k and  2 Gal(k()=k) is the
non-trivial element throughout this section. We proved in xx2,3 that V is surjective
and chose a point w = gw which corresponds to the eld k() in both cases. To
determine the ber over k()=k, we consider the map H1 (k; G0w ) ! H1(k; G).
   We rst consider case (1). So we use the denitions of G; V; w; d(A); ; ; g; w
in x2 in (4.1){(4.5).
   Let F1 = SU (2; 1) and F2 be the restriction of SL(3) from k() to k. For
g 2 SL(3)k() , we denote the entry-wise action of  by g . We dene g = t g . For
g 2 Fik() (i = 1; 2), let Fi ()(g) be the action of  induced from the k{structure
of Fi .
   We use the notation ik ; ik() for the natural imbeddings F1k ! F2k ; F1k() !
F2k() . We denote the natural inclusion map Fik ! Fik() by jik() for i = 1; 2.
Obviously, the following diagram is commutative.
                                 F1k       j1k()
                                           F1k()

  We can identify F1k() 
                         = SL(3)k(); F2k() 
                                             = SL(3)k()  SL(3)k(). With this
identication,
(4:1) ik() (g) = (g; tg 1 ); j1k() (g) = g; j2k()(g) = (g; g ); ik (g) = g;

For i = 1; 2, we can consider g ! g as a k{automorphism of the k{group Fi and
denote it by Fi (). Note that F ()(g1; g2) = (g2; g1) for (g1; g2) 2 F2k() .
   Let U be the k{vector space of 3  3 Hermitian matrices (with respect to the
                                       2


extension k()=k). Then F2 acts on U by H ! gH t F ()(g). We can identify
Uk() 
      = M(3; 3)k() and the action of (g1; g2) 2 F2k() is H ! g1 H t g2. The

determinant det H is a function on U dened over k. We dene X = fH 2 U j
det H = 1g.
   Since Gal(k()=k)  = Z=2Z, any element of H1 (k()=k; F1) is determined by a
single element h 2 F1k() 
                          = SL(3)k() satisfying the cocycle condition hF ()(h) =

h h  = 1. So we express such a cohomology class by fhg. Note that the cocycle
        1

condition for fhg is equivalent to h or h 1  being Hermitian.

Proposition (4.2) (1) Gk n Xk = H (k; F ).
                                     1
                                              1


(2) Any element of H1(k; F1) is represented by an element of H1 (k()=k; F1).
(3) If fhg 2 H1 (k()=k; F1), the corresponding Hermitian form is h 1 .


Proof. For H 2 Xk , we can nd an element g 2 F2k which maps  to H . Then cH =
fg 1g g2Gal(k=k) denes a cohomology class in H1 (k; F1). Note that H1 (k; F2) =
f1g. So by the argument of Igusa [4], the map Gk n Xk 3 H ! cH 2 H1 (k; F1) is
bijective. This proves (1).
   For H 2 Xk , put g1 = H  1 . Then det g1 = 1. So if we choose g = (g1; 1),
g 2 F2k() and it maps  to H . This means that cH is represented by the element
fg 1g g 2 H1 (k()=k; F1). This proves (2). Also if we express cH = fhg,


                    ik() (h) = (g1; 1) 1F ()(g1; 1)
                                          2

                              = (g1 1; g1 )
                              = (g1; g1) since H is Hermitian
                              = ik() (g1 1):




  Therefore, H = g1 = h 1 . This proves (3). 

 if necessary, we may assume that (x2; x3; x4) 6= 0. Multiplying an element of

form t ( 0 1    ). Multiplying an element of SL(3), we may assume that x3 =

Proof. By the above lemma, any orbit in Gk n Vkss is represented by a point of the
form ( 0 1 0 0 x5 0 0 ), where x5 2 k . It is easy to see that this element
                                                          13
belongs to the orbit Gk w for some  such that 2 2 k. This implies that the orbits
of w 's which we constructed in x2 exhausts all the orbits in Gk n Vkss . Therefore,
V is bijective.
   Finally, the character  is a square of the character 0 . So if x = gw and
g 2 Gk , the eld corresponding to x is k() and (x) = 0 (g)2(w). This proves
k((x) ) = k((w) ) = k(). 

   This theorem itself was easy to verify and we didn't have to consider Galois
cohomology. However, this has the following important interpretation in terms of
Galois cohomology, which we need to deal with more interesting case (2).
Corollary (4.5) The map H1 (k; SU (2; 1)) ! H1(k; G) is injective.
   Next we consider case (2). So we use the denitions of G; V; w; d(A); ; ; g; w
in x3 in (4.6){(4.16). Note that gg 1 2 Gw k . Therefore, we have a split exact
sequence
                              1 ! G0w ! Gw ! Z=2Z ! 1:
Since H1 (k; Te) is trivial, this implies
               V 1 (k()) = (Z=2Z) n Ker(H1(k; U (1; 1) ! H1 (k; G)):
   Let Yk be the set of non-degenerate 2  2 Hermitian matrices. As in Proposition
(3.3), H1 (k; U (1; 1)) is represented by elements of H1(k()=k; U (1; 1)). We ex-
press elements of H1(k()=k; U(1; 1)) as fhg where h 2 U (1; 1)k() =   GL(2)k() .
                  1                        1             
Then fhg ! h  induces a bijection H (k; U(1; 1)) = GL(2)k() n Yk . Moreover,
the map H1(k; SU (2; 1)) ! H1 (k; U(1; 1)) is identied with

it is easy to see that B (s)w = w(s). This proves the proposition. 
    Now we are ready to determine the ber structure of V for case (2).
Theorem (4.13) (1) V 1 (k()) = (Z=2Z) n k =Nk()=k (k()).
(2) If s 2 k , the corresponding orbit is Gk w (s), and the non-trivial element of
Z=2Z acts by w (s) ! w (s 1).
(3) If x 2 V 1 (k()), k() is generated by roots of Fx (v).
Proof. We consider GL(1)k() as a group over k. We can regard the norm
                             Nk()=k : GL(1)k() ! GL(1)k
as a k{homomorphism between k{groups. Let T = Ker(Nk()=k ). We can regard
T as the unitary group of dimension one. So as in the case of SU(2; 1); U(1; 1),
H1(k; T) is represented by elements of H1(k()=k; T). We can identify Tk()     =
      
k() , and so we express cohomology classes as fsg where s 2 k() . Since    
the action of  induced from the k{structure of T is x ! (x ) 1 , the cocycle
condition is equivalent to s 2 k and s1 ; s2 2 k are equivalent if and only if
s1s2 1 2 Nk()=k (k() ). Therefore, H1 (k; T)   = k =Nk()=k (k() ). Moreover,
the map H1 (k; U(1; 1)) ! H1(k; T) induced by the determinant can be identied
with fhg ! fdet hg for h 2 GL(2)k()     = U (1; 1)k().
    It is easy to see that if s1; s2 2 k and s1s2 1 2 Nk()=k (k() ), H (s1); H (s2)
                                        
are GL(2)k(){equivalent. This implies that fh(s1 )g = fh(s2)g in H1(k; U (1; 1)).
So the map
       f : k =Nk()=k (k()) 3 s ! fh(s)g 2 Ker(H1(k; U (1; 1)) ! H1(k; G))
is well dened. By Lemma (4.6), f is surjective. Since the composition of f and
H1(k; U (1; 1)) ! H1(k; T)  = k =Nk()=k (k()) is s ! s 1 , f is bijective.
    Since d(h(s)) = d(h(s 1)), Z=2Z acts on Ker(H1 (k; U (1; 1)) ! H1(k; G))    =
k =Nk()=k (k()) by s ! s 1 . This proves (1), (2).
    By straightforward computations,
                                   Fw(s)(v) = sv1 v2 :
So the roots of Fw (s) (v) are . It is easy to see that if g 2 Gk , the roots of
Fgw (s)(v) and Fw (s) (v) generate the same eld. This proves (3). 
    Finally we determine G0w (s) .
Denition (4.14) U(H (s)) = fA 2 GL(2)k() j AH (s)A = g.
    We consider U (H (s)) as a group over k.
Proposition (4.15) G0w (s) = U (H (s))  Te.
Proof. Let R be any k{algebra. We dene R() and the action of  on R() as in
Proposition (2.14).
    Any element in G0w (s)R() can be expressed as the product of an element of TeR
and
                                 gB (s)d(g)(gB (s)) 1;
                                         17
where g 2 GL(2)R() .
  Since g = g  ,
  (gB (s)d(g)(gB (s)) 1) = g B (s)d(g )(g B (s)) 1
                            = gB (s)d(g)B (s) 1g 1

   By straightforward computations using (4.12),
                               00 1                      1                     1

                                             H (s)
So,
                B (s) 1B (s)d(g )B (s) 1B (s) = d(H (s) 1g 1 H (s)):
This implies that
         (gB (s)d(g)(gB (s)) 1) = gB (s)d(H (s) 1 g 1H (s)))(gB (s)) 1:
  Therefore, this element belongs to G0w (s)R if and only if g = H (s) 1 g 1H (s).
This condition is equivalent to g 2 U (H (s))R. This proves the proposition again
by Theorem [7, p. 17]. 
