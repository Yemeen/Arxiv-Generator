                                                   Abstract. An integral transform for G = U (1, q) is studied. The transform maps
                                                   the positive spin ladder representations of G on a Bargmann-Segal-Fock space Fn1,q
                                                   into a space of polynomial-valued functions on the bounded realization Bq of G/K.
                                                   An inversion is given for the transform and unitary structures are given for the
                                                   geometric realization of the positive spin ladder representations over G/K.



                                                                                  0. Introduction
                                                The study of representation theory of linear reductive Lie groups is intimately
                                             related to the study of differential equations and the physics that these equations
                                             model. Such are the beginnings of the theory concerning the ladder representations
                                             of U (p, q) given in this paper.
                                                In [7], Jakobsen and Vergne show the unitarity of a cleverly constructed mul-
                                             tiplier representation πs of U (2, 2), the 4-1 cover of the conformal group, on a
                                             Hilbert space Hs of holomorphic functions on U (2, 2)/K realized as the generalized
                                             upper half plane. The elements of Hs satisfy the mass 0, spin s equations, and the
                                             restriction of πs to the Poincaré group is the representation of mass 0, spin s.
                                                A previous result that is recurrent throughout [7] is a theorem of Kunze (see [9])
                                             that guarantees the unitarity of certain multiplier representations. The key is that
                                             these representation spaces of functions possess a positive definite reproducing ker-
                                             nel that behaves well with respect to the action of the maximal compact subgroup
                                             on the image space of these functions.
                                                Meanwhile, the oscillator representation of U (p, q) has been studied and decom-
                                             posed into irreducible ladder representations in [2], [3], [8], and [16] to name a few.
                                             Consider the realization in [3]. Here the oscillator representation σ is constructed
                                             via the Stone-von Neumann theorem on a Fock space F of (p, q)-holomorphic func-
                                             tions. We use this realization of σ in this paper, despite the geometric advantages
                                             of the realization given in [2].

   The relationship between the representations πs and the oscillator representation
of U (2, 2) noted in [7] is generalized by Mantini in [10]. It is in [10] that we see the
positive spin ladder representations Fn of U (p, q) realized via an integral transform
Φn as a subspace Sn of sections of a homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle En
over U (p, q)/K in its model as a generalized unit disk D. The fiber of En over
any point ζ ∈ D is essentially the space P̄(n, Cq ) of antiholomorphic polynomials
homogeneous of degree n in q complex variables. If the real rank of U (p, q) is larger
than one, or if the rank of En is larger than one, these sections satisfy certain
linear partial differential equations. In the U (2, 2) case, these equations are the
massless field equations and the natural action on Sn is equivalent to the multiplier
representation of [7]. The transform Φn bears many similarities to the Penrose
transform (see [12] and [17]). We will discuss a version of Φn more carefully in
section 2 below. There also exists an analogous construction of the negative spin
ladder representations (see [11]), but here we restrict to the positive spin case.
   Since Φn is one-to-one on Fn for n ≥ 0, Φn is invertible. In section 3, an
inverse for Φn in the case when G = U (1, q) is presented. Trailing along behind
the inversion of Φn is the machinery that allows the production of a Hilbert space
structure on Sn so that Sn is unitarily equivalent to Fn via Φn . Such structures
are exhibited in section 4 for this case.
   Motivation for our results is essentially two-fold. On one hand, we consider the
results of Davidson [3] (which again depend critically upon results of Kunze [9]).
He gives natural unitary norms on U (p, q)/K for discrete series representations of
U (p, q). These structures take on the form
                                   Z
                      (f1 , f2 ) =   hQλ (ζ, ζ)−1 f1 (ζ), f2 (ζ)i dµ(ζ),
                                 D

where fi ∈ H(D, λ) are polynomial-valued functions on the disk, dµ is the U (p, q)-
invariant measure on D, and Qλ is the reproducing kernel for H(D, λ). The inner
product h·, ·i consists of an integral with respect to the appropriate Gaussian mea-
sure. For the ladder representations of U (p, q) which are not square-integrable, an
analogous norm does not converge (see Lemma 4.2 of [3]).
   On the other hand, we are also inspired by inversion formulas for the Radon
transform, as given in [5]. Let Pn denote the space of all hyperplanes in Rn , and
let f be a function on Rn that is integrable on each element ξ of Pn with respect
to Euclidean measure dmξ on ξ. The Radon transform fˆ of f is then given by
                                        Z
                                fˆ(ξ) = f (x) dmξ (x),
                                         ξ

while the dual transform for continuous functions ϕ on Pn is given by
                                     Z
                             ϕ̌(x) =    ϕ(ξ) dµx (ξ),
                                         ξx
                    n
where ξx = {ξ ∈ P | x ∈ ξ} and dµx is the measure of total mass one on ξx that
is invariant under rotation about x. A Schwartz function f can be recovered from
its Radon transform via the formula
                                              n−1
                                     cf = L    2    ((fˆˇ)),

                                                                           n−1
where c is a constant and L is the Laplacian on Rn . If n is even, L 2 is defined in
terms of Riesz potentials (see Lemma 2.35 of [5]). Operators playing a role similar
to these fractional powers of the Laplacian appear in our results.
   In large part, we achieve our results by constructing two special operators on
O(D, P̄(n, Cq )), P and L. Let φ be the image of a monomial in Fn under Φn .
Fixing ζ ∈ D and considering φ(ζ) as an element of P̄(n, Cq ), the mapping P is
a projection operator such that P φ(ζ) is the nonzero summand of φ(ζ) of highest
possible weight with respect to the K action on P̄(n, Cq ). The mapping L is simply
a weighted version of the mapping P which enables the overall inversion and inner
products to become unitary. Using this mapping L, we produce an inversion formula
for Φn and the desired unitary structures. These have the form

respectively.
   Alternative unitary structures for most of the ladder representations of U (p, q)
are given by Rawnsley, Schmid, and Wolf (see section 13 of [14]). These representa-
tions occur in L2 -cohomology of certain homogeneous, holomorphic vector bundles
over U (p, q)/(U (1) × U (p − 1, q)).

                                    1. Preliminaries
   In this section we wish to gain familiarity with the oscillator representation of
U (p, q) realized on a certain Fock space. The generalized unit disk and an associated
representation will be defined. We first introduce the multi-index notation that will
be prevalent throughout the paper.
1.1. Notation.
   (a) For r ∈ N, let N0 denote the set of nonnegative integers and let Nr0 denote
       the set of r-tuples of nonnegative integers.
   (b) If m = (m1 , m2 , . . . , mr ) ∈ Nr0 , then m! := m1 !m2 ! · · · mr ! and |m| :=
       m1 + m2 + · · · + mr . If z ∈ Cr , then z m := z1m1 z2m2 · · · zrmr .
   (c) Let α ∈ Ns0 , 1 ≤ s ≤ r, and let J = (j1 , j2 , . . . , js ) ∈ Ns0 be such that 1 ≤
       j1 < j2 < · · · < js ≤ r. Then, if z ∈ Cr , zJ := (zj1 , zj2 , . . . , zjs ), |zJ |2 :=
       |zj1 |2 + |zj2 |2 + · · · + |zjs |2 , and zJα := zjα11 zjα22 · · · zjαss .
   (d) Let Rp := (1, 2, . . . , p) and Sp,q := (p + 1, p + 2, . . . , p + q). When there is no
       danger of confusion, we will let R and S represent Rp and Sp,q , respectively.
   (e) For n ∈ N0 and q ∈ N, let Nq0 (n) := {η ∈ Nq0 | |η| = n}, and let d(n, q)
       denote the cardinality of Nq0 (n). Note that d(n, q) = dim P̄(n, Cq ).

    (f) The symbol ≺ will denote lexicographic, or dictionary, order on Nq0 (n).
         Here α ≺ β if there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , q} such that αi = βi for i < j and
         αj < βj . In this case we say that β succeeds α.
    (g) We have a partial order ≤ on Nq0 given by α ≤ β if αi ≤ βi for i ∈ {1, . . . , q}.
    (h) Let ǫqj := (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Nq0 , where the support lies in the j-th
         component of ǫqj . We will write ǫj for ǫqj when there is no danger of confusion.
     (i) For p, q ∈ N, we let M p×q (C) denote the set of p × q matrices with complex
         entries. If X ∈ M p×q (C), the conjugate transpose of X is written as X ∗ .
   Recall that for p, q ∈ N, U (p, q) = {g ∈ GL(p + q, C) | g ∗ Ip,q g = Ip,q }, where
Ip,q is the element of M (p+q)×(p+q) (C) given by
                                                 
                                         Ip    0
                                Ip,q =              .
                                          0 −Iq
If g ∈ G = U (p, q), the matrix g is occasionally written in block form as
                                               
                                         A B
                                   g=             ,
                                         C D
where A and D are p × p and q × q matrices, respectively. In addition, the subgroup
K ≃ U (p) × U (q) of U (p, q) given by
                            n        
                                A 0
                                                              o
                     K :=               | A ∈ U (p), D ∈ U (q)
                                0 D
is a maximal compact subgroup.
   Let dm(z) denote the normalization of Lebesgue measure on Cr given by
                                     1
                             dm(z) :=  dx1 dy1 . . . dxr dyr .
                                   πr
The following lemmas will be useful.
1.2. Lemma. Let k, l ∈ N0 , and let δkl = 1 if k = l and δkl = 0 otherwise. Then
                        Z
                                          2
                            z k z̄ l e−|z| dm(z) = δkl k!.
                                C

1.3. Lemma. Suppose that U ∈ Cq×q is Rsuch that U + U ∗ ≫ 0, and φ is a
holomorphic function of z ∈ Cq for which φ(z) exp(−z ∗ U z) dm(z) converges
absolutely. Then
                                               φ(0)
                        Z
                                   ∗
                            φ(z)e−z Uz dm(z) =       .
                         Cq                    det U
1.4. Lemma. Suppose that q ∈ N and w ∈ C. The series
                                         X w|m|
                                          q
                                            |m|q
                                        m∈N0

converges if |w| < 1 and diverges if |w| > 1.
    Finally, we say that a complex-valued function f on Cp+q is (p,q)-holomorphic
if f is holomorphic in zR and antiholomorphic in zS .

By polarizing the integral in (1.1), one obtains the inner product for the Hilbert
space F p,q , which will be denoted by h·, ·i. Let f ∈ F p,q and suppose

It follows from Lemma 1.2 that

As an application of Lemma 1.3, we obtain the reproducing formula for f ∈ F p,q
given by

   It is not immediate that σ defines a unitary representation of G on F p,q . Nonethe-
less we have the following theorem, due to Blattner and Rawnsley.
1.6. Theorem [2]. The map σ of Definition 1.5 is a unitary representation of G
on F p,q .
  Now, for n ∈ Z, let
                  Fnp,q := {f ∈ F p,q | f (e−iθ z) = einθ f (z), θ ∈ R}.
A short computation shows that Fnp,q is a G-invariant subspace of F p,q . For g ∈ G,
let σn (g) denote the restriction of σ(g) to Fnp,q .
1.7. Theorem [16]. Let n ∈ Z. The representation σn of G on Fnp,q is irreducible,
and there is an orthogonal direct sum decomposition
                                         M
                                 F p,q =   Fnp,q .

Remark. The representations σn are often referred to as ladder representations,
since the highest weights of their K-types lie equally spaced along a ray in the
weight lattice.

1.2. The Generalized Unit Disk. For p, q ∈ N, let Cp,q denote Cp+q endowed
with the hermitian form h with matrix Ip,q . A subspace V of Cp,q is negative if the
restriction of h to V is negative definite. Let M− p,q denote the set of all negative
q-planes in Cp,q . The generalized unit disk Dp,q is given by

(1.4)                 Dp,q = {ζ ∈ M p×q (C) | Iq − ζ ∗ ζ ≫ 0}.

gives a parameterization of M−
                             p,q by Dp,q .

Proof. The mapping is clearly well-defined and injective into the space of q-planes.
The q-plane V (ζ) associated to ζ ∈ Dp,q is negative due to the positivity condition
in (1.4). It remains to show that the mapping is surjective. Let
                                                      

where U1 and U2 are p × q and q × q matrices, respectively. Now U2 must be
nonsingular, as otherwise V will admit positive vectors. Hence we can change basis
to see that V = V (U1 U2−1 ). Since V is negative, U1 U2−1 satisfies the conditions of
(1.4), therefore U1 U2−1 ∈ Dp,q . 

morphic to G/K and there is a natural action of G on Dp,q that is stabilized at
0 ∈ Dp,q by K. This action is given by

   Note that Dp,q is a bounded domain in Cpq . In fact, it is one of the four classical
domains (cf. [6] or [13]). In the case we are concerned with, that is p = 1, D1,q is
simply the unit ball Bq in Cq .
   We will rely on our ability to integrate over Bq , and toward that end we use the
following result. For details, see [15].

where δη,γ = 1 if η = γ and δη,γ = 0 otherwise.
   Let P̄(n, Cq ) denote the set of antiholomorphic polynomials on Cq that are
homogeneous of degree n and let O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )) denote the set of functions
holomorphic on Dp,q taking values in P̄(n, Cq ). We conclude this section with the
construction of a representation ωn of G on O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )). Define, for n ≥ 0,
a mapping Jn : G × Dp,q → GL(P̄(n, Cq )) by
(1.5)                Jn (g, ζ)f (v) = det[Cζ + D]f ([Cζ + D]∗ v)
                    
              A B
for g =                , ζ ∈ Dp,q and v ∈ Cq . It is easily shown that Jn is a fac-
              C D
tor of automorphy. That is, if g1 , g2 ∈ G and ζ ∈ Dp,q then Jn (I, ζ) = Id and
Jn (g1 g2 , ζ) = Jn (g1 , g2 .ζ) ◦ Jn (g2 , ζ).
1.10. Definition. Suppose g ∈ G and φ ∈ O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )). Define ωn (g)φ by
                      (ωn (g)φ)(ζ, v) = Jn (g −1 , ζ)−1 φ(g −1 .ζ, v)
for ζ ∈ Dp,q and v ∈ Cq .
   Note that ωn is a multiplier representation of the type discussed in [9]. This rep-
resentation corresponds to the natural geometric action of G on the vector bundle
En . In the next section we will intertwine σn and ωn via an integral transform.

                            2. The Integral Transform
   In [10], Mantini constructs an integral transform Φn for each n ∈ Z, n ≥ 0. We
may think of Φn as a mapping of Fnp,q into O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )). This transform is
analogous to the Penrose transform (see [12]). In case either the real rank of G is
larger than one or the dimension of P̄(n, Cq ) is larger than one (i.e., when n > 0
and q > 1), the elements in the image of Φn satisfy certain linear partial differential
equations. These equations generalize the massless field equations of mathematical
physics which hold when G = U (2, 2) (see [10] or [7]). The image of the map Φn
in [10] is in a space of sections of a holomorphic, homogeneous vector bundle on
which the group acts by the natural, geometric action. Thus Φn implicitly gives a
geometric construction of the ladder representations σn , although the inner product
structure on this realization has previously been unknown.
   At this point let us recall that our primary goal is to create an inversion for
Φn and then use this inversion to develop unitary structures for the geometric
realization of σn obtained via Φn . In this section we familiarize ourselves with Φn
and some of its important properties. Further details may be found in [10] and [11].
2.1. Proposition [10]. Suppose n ≥ 0 and f ∈ Fnp,q . Then we have an integral
transform Φn : Fnp,q → O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )) given by
                                  Z
                                                 ∗       2
                  (Φn f )(ζ, v) =     f (ζw, w)ev w e−|w| dm(w),
                                     Cq

where v ∈ Cq and (Φn f )(ζ, v) depends holomorphically on ζ ∈ Dp,q .
   The transform of Proposition 2.1 is simplified from the transform constructed
by Mantini in [10]. Here we have used the trivialization of the vector bundle in [10]
8                      JOHN D. LORCH AND LISA A. MANTINI

with the multiplier action ωn . We have also used Davidson’s model of the Fock
space representation σn instead of the L2 -cohomology realization of Blattner and
Rawnsley (see [2]). The transform is essentially given by restriction to a negative
q-plane determined by ζ ∈ Dp,q followed by a projection operator, giving rise to
an L2 version of the Penrose transform. Notice that the projection operator is the
specialization to signature (0, q) of the reproducing formula given in (1.3).
   The first important feature of Φn is that it serves as an intertwining map between
the representations σn and ωn .
2.2. Theorem [10]. The mapping Φn is one-to-one for n ≥ 0 and identically zero
for n < 0. Furthermore, for all f ∈ Fnp,q , g ∈ G, and n ≥ 0, the mapping Φn
satisfies
                         ωn (g)(Φn f ) = Φn (σn (g)f ).
  Theorem 2.2 implies that for n ≥ 0, Φn has an inverse defined on Φn (Fnp,q ).
Also, it says that σn is realized on Φn (Fnp,q ) by a subrepresentation of ωn .
2.3. Lemma [10]. Fix n ∈ Z and ζ ∈ Dp,q . The mapping of Fnp,q into Fn0,q given
by
                              f 7→ Φn f (ζ, ·)
is continuous.
    The next thing to note is that for many values of p and q, the elements of
Φn (Fnp,q ) satisfy certain interesting differential equations. Using the notation of
[4], let p,q be the (p + 1) × q matrix of differential operators where

                                     ∂
                                             for 1 ≤ i ≤ p and 1 ≤ j ≤ q,
                                (
                                    ∂ζij ,
                  (p,q )ij =        ∂
                                    ∂v̄j ,   for i = p + 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ q.

2.4. Theorem [10].
    (a) Let p, q ∈ N be such that both p and q are greater than one. Then Φn (Fnp,q )
        is a subset of O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )) annihilated by the differential operators
        formed by taking 2 × 2-minors of p,q .
    (b) If p = 1, n ≥ 1 and q > 1, then Φn (Fn1,q ) is a subset of O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) that
        is annihilated by the differential operators formed by taking 2 × 2-minors of
        1,q .

Remark. In case p = q = 2, the differential operators formed by taking 2 × 2-minors
of 2,2 are the complexifications of the massless field equations. Also, it has been
shown in [4] that the K-finite vectors in O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )) with respect to ωn that
satisfy the differential equations mentioned in the theorem are exactly the K-finite
vectors in Φn (Fnp,q ).
   Suppose that n ∈ N0 and φ ∈ O(Dp,q , P̄(n, Cq )). Then there exists, for each
η ∈ Nq0 (n), a holomorphic complex-valued function ψ (η) on Dp,q such that

                                               X                     v̄ η

                                                                     η!

The component functions ψ (η) in (2.1) are indexed by η ∈ Nq0 (n) under the lexico-
graphic order ≺ (see part (f) of Notation 1.1), with indices ranging in order from
(0, . . . , 0, n) through (n, 0, . . . , 0). In what follows, this description of φ(ζ, v) will
sometimes be convenient.
   We finish this section with a lemma that will be of importance later on. Define,
for α ∈ Np0 , β ∈ Nq0 and z ∈ Cp+q ,
                                                           α β
(2.2)                                          fαβ (z) := zR z̄S .
We wish to compute the image of fαβ under the transform Φ(|β|−|α|) . In order to
simplify our expressions, we first introduce some notation.
   Given γ ∈ M p×q (C) and i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p}, let γ(i) denote the i-th row of γ. Let
r(γ) denote the element of Cq obtained by taking the sum of the rows of γ, and
let c(γ) ∈ Cp denote the sum of the columns of γ. Given α ∈ Np0 and α̃ ∈ Nq0 , let
M p×q (α, α̃) denote the subset of M p×q (N0 ) whose elements γ satisfy
                                 c(γ) = α                and            r(γ) = α̃.
Notice that M p×q (α, α̃) is nonempty only when |α| = |α̃|. Now, if γ ∈ M p×q (N0 )
and ζ ∈ Dp,q , we may write ζ γ and γ! for
                                  p                                     p
                                  Y        γ                            Y
                                          ζ(i)(i)        and                  γ(i) !,
                                 i=1                                    i=1

respectively. Finally, when p and q are understood, we let M (α, α̃) stand for
M p×q (α, α̃).

where γ is the p × q matrix with rows γ(1) , . . . , γ(p) .
  Now, we are able to compute the integral in the preceding line by expanding the
exponential function into its Taylor series and then applying Lemma 1.2 repeatedly.
Doing so, we obtain

                              3. An Inversion Formula
   The goal of this section is to give an inversion formula for the integral transform
Φn of section 2, when n ≥ 0, p = 1, and q ≥ 1. Throughout this section, p, q,
and n will remain as in the previous sentence. We begin with the introduction of
two mappings of O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) into itself. One mapping, P , is a projection that
isolates a nonzero summand of Φn fν,n . The other mapping, L, is simply a weighted
version of P which we then use to invert the transform Φn . The weighting of L is
chosen to ensure the G-equivariance of our inversion formula.
                                                     |ν|−n ν
   Let ν ∈ Nq0 with |ν| ≥ n and let fν,n (z) = z1         z̄S , as in Corollary 2.6. For
            q                                               (η)
each η ∈ N0 (n) we define a complex-valued function ψν on Bq so that

                                                        X                     v̄ η
(3.1)               φν (ζ, v) = Φn fν,n (ζ, v) =                  ψν(η) (ζ)        ,
                                                                              η!

                               (η)
as in (2.1). The functions ψν        were calculated in Corollary 2.6.
3.1. Lemma. Let ν ∈ Nq0 with |ν| ≥ n. Then there exists η ∈ Nq0 (n) such that
 (η)
ψν is not identically zero on Bq .
Proof. Since |ν| ≥ n, there exists η ∈ Nq0 (n) such that ν ≥ η. By Corollary 2.6,
 (η)
ψν is the desired nonzero component. 

3.2. Lemma. Suppose that ν, ν ′ ∈ Nq0 with |ν ′ |, |ν| ≥ n. Furthermore, suppose
that there exists η ∈ Nq0 (n) with

                                                     (η)
                                         ψν(η) = ψν ′ 6= 0.

Then ν = ν ′ .
                                (η)                              (η)                   ′
                                                                                           −η
Proof. By Corollary 2.6, ψν (ζ) = Cν ζ ν−η and ψν ′ (ζ) = Cν ′ ζ ν                              , where Cν , Cν ′
are nonzero constants. Hence ν = ν ′ . 
   Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 show that fν,n can be recovered from a single nonzero
             (η)
summand ψν (ζ)v̄ η /η! of φν (ζ, v) in (3.1). However, there may be more than one
nonzero summand of φν . Our approach to the inversion problem is to first develop
a method for isolating a nonzero summand of φν .
   We will construct a projection P that when applied to φν returns the ην -th
            (η )
summand ψν ν v̄ ην /ην ! in (3.1), where ην ∈ Nq0 (n) is maximal in the lexicographic
                           (η )
order ≺ with respect to ψν ν being nonzero. Restricting the ωn action of Definition
1.10 to K, we see that the K action on P̄(n, Cq ) (thought of as the fiber over ζ = 0
of the holomorphic, homogeneous vector bundle En for G over G/K) is simply the
natural action of U (q) by left translation. Notice that each v̄ η is a weight vector for
this representation, and that the lexicographic order ≺ corresponds to the order on
these weight vectors, from lowest to highest. Hence P will return the summand of
φν of highest possible weight with respect to this action of K on P̄(n, Cq ).
3.3. Definition. For each j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , q} define Qj : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) →
O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by

                     Qj f (ζ, v) = f (ζ1 , . . . , ζj−1 , 0, ζj+1 , . . . , ζq , v).


3.4. Definition. If η ∈ Nq0 (n) has an immediate successor η̃ with respect to the
partial order ≺, let s(η) be the index at which η first disagrees with η̃. If η has no
immediate successor, i.e., η = (n, 0, . . . , 0), let s(η) = 0.
   For example, η = (3, 1, 2, 4, 0) has immediate successor η̃ = (3, 1, 3, 3, 0). So
s(η) = 3, as η and η̃ first disagree in the third component.
3.5. Definition. Suppose that η ∈ Nq0 (n). Define Pη : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) →
O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by
                                    s(η)
                                    Y

                                                    j=1

where s(η) is as in Definition 3.4. If η = (n, 0, . . . , 0), then Pη := Id.
3.6. Definition. Define P : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) → O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by

                                               X             v̄ η ∂ n φ
                          (P φ)(ζ, v) =                 Pη              (ζ, v).

   The role of the operator (v̄ η /η!)(∂ n /∂v̄ η ) in Definition 3.6 is to single out the
terms containing v̄ η in φ, asin(2.1). Then Pη is applied only to those terms.
   For example, let q = 3 and n = 2. In this case the following table gives possi-
ble values of η ∈ N30 (2), in increasing lexicographic order, and the corresponding
mappings Pη .

Any function φ ∈ O(B3 , P̄(2, C3 )) is written using (2.1) as

                                     v̄32                                               v̄ 2
           φ(ζ, v) = ψ (0,0,2) (ζ)        + ψ (0,1,1) (ζ)v̄2 v̄3 + · · · + ψ (2,0,0) (ζ) 1 ,
                                     2!                                                 2!
and the map P acts by Pη , as given in the table, on the term containing v̄ η .
   Now let f ∈ F21,3 be given by f (z) = z13 z̄2 z̄33 z̄4 , so that ν = (1, 3, 1), in the
notation of Corollary 2.6. The η ∈ N30 (2) for which ν ≥ η are (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0),
(1, 0, 1), and (1, 1, 0). It follows from Corollary 2.6 that

                                                          v̄22
          (Φ2 f )(ζ, v) = 18ζ1 ζ22 v̄2 v̄3 + 36ζ1 ζ2 ζ3        + 6ζ23 v̄1 v̄3 + 18ζ22 ζ3 v̄1 v̄2 .
                                                          2!
Using Definition 3.6 and the table above, we compute that for φ = Φ2 f ,

                                   P φ(ζ, v) = 18ζ22 ζ3 v̄1 v̄2 .

Notice that only one term of φ(ζ, v) remains, the term indexed by the maximal
η ∈ N30 (2) with respect to lexicographic order for which ψ (η) 6= 0. This is no
coincidence, as is shown by the next lemma.
                                                                          |ν|−n
3.7. Lemma. Fix ν ∈ Nq0 with |ν| ≥ n. Let fν,n (z) = z1   z̄Sν , and let Φn fν,n =

φν = η∈Nq (n) ψν v̄ /η!, as in (3.1). Let α ∈ N0 (n) be maximal in the order ≺
             0

with respect to ψν       being nonzero. Then Pα ψν v̄ α /α! = ψν v̄ α /α! and for η ≺ α,
    (η)
Pη ψν v̄ η /η! = 0.
                 (η)                                                       (η)                 (η)
Proof. Since ψν is a monomial in ζ, then either Pη ψν v̄ η /η! = ψν v̄ η /η! or
    (η)                                                        (α)           (α)
Pη ψν v̄ η /η! = 0 for any η ∈ Nq0 (n). We first show that Pα ψν v̄ α /α! = ψν v̄ α /α!.
   Suppose that α = (n, 0, . . . , 0). Then by Definition 3.5, Pα = Id, so we have
    (α)             (α)
Pα ψν v̄ α /α! = ψν v̄ α /α! trivially.

   So we now assume that α = (α1 , . . . , αq ) 6= (n, 0, . . . , 0). Let α̃ be the immediate
successor of α within Nq0 (n). Note that α̃i = αi for 1 ≤ i < s(α). Also, α̃s(α) >
αs(α) , and |α̃| = |α| = n. It follows that there must be a nonzero component αt of
α with s(α) < t ≤ q. Also, by Corollary 2.6, we have that

                                  ψν(α) (ζ) = Cα ζ1ν1 −α1 . . . ζqνq −αq ,

                                                                                                           (α)
where ν ≥ α and Cα is a constant. For a contradiction, assume that Pα ψν v̄ α /α! =
0. Then, by Definition 3.5, there exists k ∈ {1, . . . , s(α)} with νk −αk > 0. Consider
α′ = α − ǫt + ǫk . We have that α′ ∈ Nq0 (n) with α′ ≻ α. Furthermore, by Corollary
      (α′ )
2.6, ψν 6= 0. This contradicts the maximality of α.
                                                                         (η)
   Fix η ≺ α. The proof will be concluded by showing that Pη ψν v̄ η /η! = 0. If
  (η)                                                                              (η)
ψν = 0 then the result is immediate. So, for a contradiction, assume that ψν 6= 0
              (η)             (η)
and that Pη ψν v̄ η /η! = ψν v̄ η /η!. Definition 3.5 and Corollary 2.6 then imply that
νi − ηi = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , s(η)}. Now, since α ≻ η, there exists k ∈ {1, . . . , s(η)}
                                                                                 (α)
such that αk > ηk . However, then νk − αk < 0, and so by Corollary 2.6, ψν = 0.
                                     (α)
This contradicts the fact that ψν 6= 0. 

   We now construct another mapping of O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) into itself that we will
use to weight the mapping P . Essentially, we will be assigning to each element
φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) a solution of a certain partial differential equation.

3.8. Definition. Suppose f ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )), ζ ∈ Bq , and v ∈ Cq . For a
given non-negative integer m and an index j ∈ {1, . . . , q}, we define the mapping
I(m, j) : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) → O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by

  (I(m, j)f )(ζ, v)
                  Z 1Z      tm         Z   t2
              :=                 ···            f (ζ1 , . . . , ζj−1 , t1 ζj , ζj+1 , . . . , ζq , v) dt1 dt2 . . . dtm ,
                   0    0              0


with the convention that (I(0, j)f )(ζ, v) = f (ζ, v).
                                                                                            k!
   For example, if f (ζ, v) = ζjk v̄1n , then (I(m, j)f )(ζ, v) =                                ζ k v̄ n .
                                                                                         (k + m)! j 1
3.9. Definition. Define Fη : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) → O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by
                                                                     

where η ∈ Nq0 (n).

   Suppose that f ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) and

is the Taylor series expansion for f centered at the origin. Since the series above
converges uniformly on compact subsets of Bq , it follows from Definition 3.8 that

   Now, we weight the mapping P by the Fη to obtain a new mapping that will
play a large role in the rest of the paper.
3.10. Definition. Define L : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) → O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) by
                                   X                ∂nφ

                                           η∈N0 (n)

For example, recall that if f (z) = z13 z̄2 z̄33 z̄4 , and φ = Φ2 f , then
                                    P φ(ζ, v) = 18ζ22 ζ3 v̄1 v¯2 .
Applying (3.2) and Definition 3.10, we compute that
                                        (0, 2, 1)!
                 Lφ(ζ, v) = 18                           ζ 2 ζ3 v̄1 v¯2 = 6ζ22 ζ3 v̄1 v¯2 .
                                 ((0, 2, 1) + (1, 1, 0))! 2
     For φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )), we express φ as the sum
                                           X               v̄ η
                               φ(ζ, v) =         ψ (η) (ζ)

                                              η∈N0 (n)

as in (2.1). For a compact subset A of Bq , set
                                       X
(3.3)                        kφk2A :=         |ψ (η) |2A ,
                                                η∈Nq0 (n)

where | · |A is the supremum norm over A. We endow O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) with the
topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of Bq , i.e., the topology in-
duced by the norm of (3.3).
3.11. Lemma. The mapping L : O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) → O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) is continu-
ous.
Proof. The remarks after Definition 3.9 serve to show that Fη is continuous for each
η ∈ Nq0 (n). It remains to show that Pη is continuous.
   Let φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )). Suppose that {φk } is a sequence of functions in
O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) such that {φk } converges to φ uniformly on compact subsets of
Bq , in the norm of (3.3). Let A be compact in Bq and for 1 ≤ j ≤ q, let Aj
be a compact subset of Bq containing the natural projection of A onto the set
{ζ ∈ Bq | ζj = 0}. Then
                              kQj φ − Qj φk kA ≤ kφ − φk kAj .
It follows that Qj is continuous and hence Pη is continuous.                       
     We are now ready to invert the transform Φn of section 2.

3.12. Theorem. Suppose that φ ∈ Φn (Fn1,q ), and that φ = Φn f , for f ∈ Fn1,q .

Proof. The theorem is proven in two steps. First, given ν ∈ Nq0 with |ν| ≥ n, we let
            |ν|−n ν
fν,n (z) = z1    z̄S and we let φν = Φn fν,n . We will prove that the theorem holds
for φν . Then we will show that the theorem holds for an arbitrary φ ∈ Φn (Fn1,q ).
                                                                   (η )
   So, let ν be as above, and let ην ∈ Nq0 (n) be such that Pην (ψν ν v̄ ην /ην !) 6= 0.
Then by Lemma 3.7 and Definition 3.10,
                                                 X                           ∂ n φν
                         (Lφν )(ζ, v) =                      Fη Pη v̄ η             (ζ, v)
                                                                              ∂v̄ η

This series converges uniformly on compact subsets of Cq+1 and in the norm on
Fn1,q induced by h·, ·i. Hence by Lemma 2.3, given ζ ∈ Bq ,

Moreover, the series in (3.5) constitutes a Taylor series expansion for φ, and so the
series converges uniformly on compact subsets of Bq . Hence by (1.3) and Lemma

   Notice that we may exchange integration over Cq with summation in the equa-
tion preceding (3.6) due to the absolute convergence of the integral in v. We finish
by showing that we may interchange integration and summation in the right hand
side of (3.6). The theorem will then follow immediately from the first part of the
proof. Thus by the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, it suffices to show that

   By (1.2), the first factor of (3.8) is simply hf, f i 2 , while the second factor is
finite by Lemma 1.4. Hence the product in (3.8) is finite, and so the proof is
concluded. 

                        4. A Hilbert Space Structure for Φn (Fn1,q )
   Recalling Theorems 1.7 and 2.2, observe that for n ≥ 0 the space Φn (Fn1,q ) is an
irreducible subspace of O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) under the representation ωn of U (1, q). Let
ϑn denote this subrepresentation. One would like to explicitly describe a Hilbert
space structure on Φn (Fn1,q ) with the property that ϑn and σn will be unitarily
equivalent via Φn . It is worth pointing out that σn is not in the discrete series for
any n ≥ 0 if p = 1 and q > 1. If p = q = 1 then the ladder representation of spin
n ≥ 1 is in the discrete series and the representation with spin n = 0 is a limit of
discrete series (see Theorem 4.4 of [3]).
4.1. Definition. For φ1 , φ2 ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )), define

                             dq q

whenever the integral above converges. Here L is as in Definition 3.10.
   For φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )), put kφk2n,q := ((φ, φ))n,q . It is easy to show that on
the set {φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) | kφk2n,q < ∞}, the form ((·, ·))n,q is hermitian and
positive semi-definite. We next examine its behavior on Φn (Fn1,q ).
4.2. Theorem. Let φ1 , φ2 ∈ Φn (Fn1,q ) with φ1 = Φn f1 and φ2 = Φn f2 for
f1 , f2 ∈ Fn1,q . Then
                          ((φ1 , φ2 ))n,q = hf1 , f2 i.

Hence ((·, ·))n,q defines a positive definite hermitian form on Φn (Fn1,q ).

4.3. Corollary. The vector space Φn (Fn1,q ), when endowed with the inner product
((·, ·))n,q , is a Hilbert space.
Proof. By Theorem 4.2, Φn (Fn1,q ) is a pre-Hilbert space. So all we need to show
is that Φn (Fn1,q ) is complete. Suppose that {φk } is a sequence in Φn (Fn1,q ) that
is Cauchy in the norm induced by ((·, ·))n,q , and suppose that φk = Φn (fk ) for
fk ∈ Fn1,q . Then by Theorem 4.2, the sequence {fk } is Cauchy in the Hilbert Space
Fn1,q . Hence there is a function f ∈ Fn1,q such that fk converges to f in norm. Let
φ = Φn f . Then φ ∈ Φn (Fn1,q ) and φk converges to φ in norm. 
4.4. Corollary. The representation ϑn is irreducible and unitary on the Hilbert
space Φn (Fn1,q ) and is unitarily equivalent to σn via Φn .
Proof. This follows from Theorems 2.2 and 4.2. 
   At this point one may wonder whether the inner product ((·, ·))n,q characterizes
Φn (Fn1,q ) . In general, this inner product is not enough to characterize Φn (Fn1,q ).
However, when we put the inner product together with the differential equations
of Theorem 2.4, we are able to combine our results with those of [4] to obtain a
complete characterization of Φn (Fn1,q ).
   For q > 1, let D1,q denote the set of differential operators consisting of all 2 × 2-
minors of the matrix of differential operators
                                         ∂              ∂
                                                 ···
                                                              !
                                        ∂ζ1            ∂ζq

of Theorem 2.4. If q = 1, we will say that D1,1 = ∅. Also, let

    Xn1,q = {φ ∈ O(Bq , P̄(n, Cq )) | kφk2n,q < ∞ and Dφ = 0 for all D ∈ D1,q }.

4.5. Theorem. Let n ∈ N0 and q ∈ N. Then Φn (Fn1,q ) = Xn1,q .
Proof. From Theorems 2.4 and 4.2, we know that Φn (Fn1,q ) ⊂ Xn1,q . So it remains
to verify the reverse inclusion.
   Suppose that φ ∈ Xn1,q . Then
                                           ∞
                                           X
                               φ(ζ, v) =         φ(m) (ζ, v),
                                           m=0


where each φ(m) is a P̄(n, Cq )-valued holomorphic polynomial that is homogeneous
                                           P∞
of degree m on Bq . Since 0 = Dφ(ζ, v) = m=0 Dφ(m) (ζ, v), and since the operator
D preserves the homogeneity, hence the linear independence of the functions Dφ(m) ,
we conclude that Dφ(m) = 0 for all m ∈ N0 . The proof of Theorem 4.2 implies
that any polynomial in ζ has finite norm. Hence φ(m) ∈ Xn1,q for each m.
   In the case that d(n, q) > 1, the results of [4] imply that each φ(m) is also an
element of Φn (Fn1,q ). In fact, this also holds in the line bundle case, i.e., when
d(n, q) = 1. Corollary 2.6 shows that when d(n, q) = 1, the image of a monomial is
a monomial. Thus in this case we can invert Φn directly from Corollary 2.6.

  So, with φ(m) as above, there exists f(m) ∈ Fn1,q with Φn f(m) = φ(m) for each
m ∈ N0 . By Corollary 2.6, f(m) must have the form

Put f =     f(m) . Since m=0 φ(m) converges to φ uniformly on compact subsets of
Bq (see (3.3)), we may apply the dominated convergence theorem as in 4.2, along
with Corollary 4.3, to get

                                                 |ν|=m+n

                              = hf, f i.

Hence hf, f i < ∞, and so f ∈ Fn1,q . From the continuity of Φn we then conclude
that Φn f = φ. 
