                                                                             Abstract

                                                 We consider the Lie-algebra of the group of diffeomorphisms of a d-
                                              dimensional torus which is also known to be the algebra of derivations
                                              on a Laurent polynomial ring A in d commuting variables denoted
                                              by DerA. The universal central extension of Der A for d = 1 is the
                                              so called Virasoro algebra. The connection between Virasoro algebra
                                              and physics is well known. See for example the book on Conformal
                                              Field Theory by Di Francesco, Mathieu and Senechal.
                                                 In this paper we classify (A, Der A) modules which are irreducible
                                              and has finite dimensional weight spaces. Earlier Larsson constructed
                                              a large class of modules the so called tensor fields based on gℓd modules
                                              which are also A modules. We prove that they exhaust all (A, Der A)
                                              irreducible modules.

Introduction

   It is well known that the group of diffeomorphisms on a manifold is very
important and shows up directly in many branches of physics (see for example
Ref.22). We are particularly interested in d-dimensional torus. The case
d = 1 is well studied by both mathematicians and physicists. The one
dimensional central extension of the Lie-algebra of diffeomorphisms of the
circle is well known object called Virasoro algebra. The representation theory
of Virasoro algebra is studied in great detail. See Ref.13.
   The Virasoro algebra acts on any (except when the level is negative of
dual Coxeter number) highest weight module of the affine Lie algebra through
the use of the famous Sugawara operators. It is well known that affine Lie
algebras admit representation on the Fock space (see Ref.12) and hence ad-
mits a representation of the Virasoro algebra. This classical theory is what
we originally want to generalize to d-dimensional torus.
   The relation to physics is well established in the book on Conformal Field
Theory by Di Francesco, Mathieu and Senechal. Ref.10. Specially the chap-
ters 13 to 18 explains the connection between physics and the representation
theory of Virasoro and affine Kac-Moody Lie-algebras. Several important
papers on these aspects have been put in one volume by Goddard and Olive
in Ref.8. The most fundamental paper in this direction is due to Belavin,
Polyakov and Zamolodchikov in Ref.1.
   The generalization of affine Lie algebra is the so called toroidal Lie-
algebra. For the first time a large class of representations are constructed
in Refs. 6 and 20 through the use of vertex operators generalizing the Fock
space construction to the toroidal Lie-algebras. One significant difference for
the toroidal Lie-algebra is that the universal center is infinite dimensional
unlike in the affine case where it is one dimensional.


                                      2
   So the next natural question is to generalise Virasoro algebra and see
whether the algebra acts on the Fock space. For that we first denote the
Lie algebra of diffeomorphisms of d-dimensional torus by DerA (it is known
that DerA is isomorphic to the derivations of Laurent polynomial ring A in
d-variables). Here one should mention that several attempts has been made
by physicists to give a Fock space representation to DerA or to its extension
(see Ref. 9). They all failed to produce any interesting results due to lack of
proper definition of “normal ordering” among other things. At this juncture
an interesting result has come out from Ref.21 which says that DerA has no
non-trivial central extension for d ≥ 2.
   Let us go back to the vertex construction of toroidal Lie-algebra of Ref.
6. Here operators are constructed for DerA generalizing the Sugawara Con-
struction. But the corresponding extension for DerA is very wild (certainly
non-central) and not tractable (see Ref.5). In the process an interesting
abelian extension for DerA has been created in Ref. 6 and the abelian part
is exactly the center of the toroidal Lie algebra. So the semi-direct sum of
the toroidal Lie algebra and DerA with common extension has emerged as
an interesting object which we will now define.
   We will first define toroidal Lie algebra. Let G be simple finite dimensional
Lie algebra and let <, > be a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on G.
Fix a positive integer d and let A = C[t±1           ±1
                                        1 , · · · , td ] be a Laurent polynomial
ring in d-commuting variables.
   Let ΩA be the module of differentials which can be defined as vector
space spanned by tr Ki , i = 1, · · · , d and r ∈ Zn . Let dA be the subspace
spanned by Σri tr Ki and consider the toroidal Lie algebra G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA
with Lie-bracket.

           [X ⊗ tr , Y ⊗ ts ] = [X, Y ] ⊗ tr+s + < X, Y > Σri tr+s Ki

ΩA /dA is central.

                                       3
    Let DerA be the derivation on A. For u ∈ Cd and r ∈ Zd let D(u, r) =
           d
Σui tr ti dti where u = (u1 , · · · , ud) and r = (r1 , · · · , rd ), tr = tr11 tr22 · · · trdd ∈ A.
Let K(u, r) = Σui tr Ki . Consider the Lie-algebra

                               τ = G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA ⊕ DerA

             [D(u, r), D(v, s)] = D(w, r + s) − (u, s)(v, r)K(r, r + s)

where w = (u, s)v − (v, r)u and ( , ) is the standard inner product in Cd

             [D(u, r), K(v, s)] = (u, s)K(v, r + s) + (u, v)K(r, r + s)

                                    [K(u, r), K(v, s)] = 0

The first question is that can we construct a representation for τ from known
methods. Several attempts have been made (Ref. 2, 3 and 6). Eventually
in a remarkable paper Yuly Billig (Ref.24) has succeeded in constructing a
class of modules for τ through the use of Vertex operator algebras (VOA). In
the process Yuly Billig has used the DerA modules constructed in Ref.16 and
studied in Ref.4. One natural question is, does there exists more modules for
DerA so that we get a much larger class of models of τ .
    In an interesting paper by Jiang and Meng (Ref.11) it is proved that
classification of irreducible integrable modules of τ can be reduced to the
classification of irreducible (A, DerA) modules which the current paper set-
tles. See also ref.7 for more precise results.
    Let me explain the results of this paper in more detail. In Ref.16, Larsson
constructed a large class of DerA modules and some of them with finite
dimensional weight spaces. In fact he constructed a functor from gld -modules
to DerA-modules. In Ref.4 the author proves that the image of an irreducible
finite dimensional module is most often irreducible.
    Further Larsson’s DerA modules are A modules too and they are always
irreducible as (A, DerA)-modules. Thus the purpose of the paper is to prove

                                                 4
the converse. So we prove in Theorem 1.9 that any (A, DerA) module which
is irreducible and has finite dimensional weight spaces has to come from
Larsson’s construction.
   It will be certainly interesting to classify all irreducible DerA modules
with finite dimensional weight spaces. Now some kind of highest weight
modules are constructed in Ref.2 and 3 (They are not A modules). We will
also note that GL(d, Z) acts as automorphisms on DerA and so we can twist
a DerA module by GL(d, Z). (Larsson’s modules are closed under GL(d, Z)
action). So it will be interesting to prove that any irreducible DerA module
with finite dimensional weight spaces is either an highest weight module or a
Larsson’s module upto a twist of GL(d, Z) action. The problem is completely
solved for d=1 by Mathieu in Ref.19
   Our results in Ref.6 have been reinterpreted in the language of physics
by Larsson in Refs. 17 and 18. Larsson is also first to talk about non-central
extensions is Ref. 15. DerA has also been studied in Ref.23.


1. Section
(1.1) Throughout this paper we fix a positive integer d ≥ 2 and a Laurent
polynomial ring A = C[t±1         ±1                                 d
                       1 , · · · td ] in d commuting variables. Let C be d
copies of complex field C. Let e1 , · · · ed be the standard basis of Cd and let
(, ) be the standard form on Cd such that (ei , ej ) = δij .

(1.2) Let Γ = Ze1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Zed . Throughout this paper we use m, n, r and
                                     P
s to denote elements of Γ. For r =      ri ei ∈ Γ let tr = tr11 tr22 · · · trdd ∈ A
and let D i (r) = tr ti dtdi be a derivation on A. Let DerA be the Lie-algebra of
derivations of A. It is easy to verify that D i (r), 1 ≤ i ≤ d, r ∈ Γ is a basis
                  P                            P
of DerA. For u =      ui ei ∈ Cd let D(u, r) =    uiD i (r). Then DerA has the
following Lie structure:


                                        5
(1.3)
                       [D(u, r), D(v, s)] = D(w, r + s)

where w = (u, s)v − (v, r)u, r, s ∈ Γ and u, v ∈ Cd . Let h be the subspace
spanned by D i(0), 1 ≤ i ≤ d, which is a maximal abelian subalgebra of DerA.

(1.4) Note that D(u, r)ts = (u, s)tr+s . Thus A ⊕ DerA is a Lie-algebra by
extending the Lie structure in the following way

                                   [tr , ts ] = 0

                         [D(u, r), tm] = (u, m)tr+m .

Let h̃ = C ⊕ h which is an abelian subalgebra of A ⊕ DerA.
   The purpose of this paper is to study A⊕DerA modules which are weight
modules for h̃ with finite dimensional weight spaces and to classify such
modules with some natural conditions.
   We first recall DerA modules which are constructed and studied in Ref-
erences 16 and 4.

(1.5) Let gℓd be the Lie-algebra of d × d matrices with entries in C. Let
Eij be the elementary matrix with (i, j) th entry 1 and zero elsewhere. Then
it is well known that gℓd is spanned by Eij , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d with the following
Lie-bracket
                         [Eij , Ekℓ ] = δjk eiℓ − δiℓ Ekj .

Let gℓd = sℓd ⊕ CI where sℓd is a Lie-subalgebra of trace zero matrices and I
is the identity matrix. Let V (ψ) be the irreducible finite dimensional module
for sℓd where ψ is a dominant integral weight. Let I act by scalar b on V (ψ)
and denote the resultant gℓd module by V (ψ, b). Let α ∈ Cd and we will
make F α (ψ, b) := V (ψ, b) ⊗ A a DerA module. First denote v ⊗ tm by v(m)
for v in V (ψ, b) and m in Γ.

where m, r ∈ Γ, u ∈ C , v ∈ V (ψ, b). We will now recall the following

(1.7) Theorem (Theorem (1.9) and Proposition (5.1) of Ref.4).
(1) F α (ψ, b) is irreducible as DerA module if (ψ, b) 6= (δk , k), (0, b), 1 ≤ k ≤
d − 1 where δk is the kth fundamental weight of sℓd .
(2) F α (0, b) is irreducible as DerA module unless α ∈ Γ and b ∈ {0, d}.
   In all other cases F α (ψ, b) is reducible and the submodule structure has
been worked out in Proposition (5.1) and Theorem (5.5) of Ref.4.
   Recall that A is associative algebra with unit and F α (ψ, b) is a A module
by defining
                              tm · v(r) = v(m + r)
for m, r ∈ Γ and v ∈ V (ψ, b). Further it is easy to see that F α (ψ, b) is a
A ⊕ DerA module.

(1.8) Proposition F α (ψ, b) is irreducible as A ⊕ DerA module.

Proof First note that F α (ψ, b) is a weight module with respective to h̃
and the weight spaces are V (ψ) ⊗ tm . Suppose W is a non-zero A ⊕ DerA
submodule of F α (ψ, b). As submodule of a weight module is a weight module,
W is a weight module. From the action of A it is clear that v(m) ∈ W implies
v(s) ∈ W for all s ∈ Γ. Thus W = W1 ⊗ A for some W1 ⊆ V (ψ, b). Now
choose u = ei , r = ej and consider

              D(u, r)v(m) = (u, m + α)v(m + r) + (Eji v)(m + r).

It now follows from the above remarks that W1 is gℓd -invariant. Since V (ψ)
is irreducible and W1 is non-zero, it follows that W1 = V (ψ) and hence
W = F α (ψ, b).

                                        7
   The purpose of this paper is to prove converse of the above proposition.
In other words we classify A ⊕ DerA modules with certain natural properties.

(1.9) Theorem Let V be irreducible module for A ⊕ DerA which is also
a weight module for h̃ with finite dimensional weight spaces. We further
assume the following:

 (1) V is a A-module as associative algebra and the Lie-module structure
     of A comes from associative algebra.

 (2) 1.v = v, ∀v in V .


     Then V ∼
            = F α (ψ, b) (for some α, ψ, b) as A ⊕ DerA-module.

   We need to develop several lemmas to prove the theorem which will be
done in Section 2. The final proof will be given in Section 3.


2. Section
    First we need to change some notation. We treat A as group algebra
over Γ. For that let k(r) be a symbol for r ∈ Γ. Let A be the linear span of
k(r), r ∈ Γ with multiplication defined as k(r) · k(s) = k(r + s).
   Let U be the universal enveloping algebra of A ⊕ DerA. Let L be the two
sided ideal of U generated by k(r)k(s) − k(r + s) and k(0) − 1.
   Throughout this section the module V is as in Theorem (1.9). Since V is a
A module, L acts trivially and hence V is a U/L-module. Let V = ⊕r∈Γ Vr be
the weight space decomposition and Vr = {v ∈ V | D(u, 0)v = (u, r + α)v, ∀u
in Cd }. Such a uniform α in Cd exists as V is irreducible. In fact take any
weight space where h acts as linear function which can be taken as u 7→ (u, α)
for some α ∈ Cd . Because of irreducibility the action of h on the rest of the

                                      8
spaces is easily computed. Further each Vr is a h̃-module as 1 in A acts as
one on the entire module.

(2.1) Let U1 = U/L and let T (u, r) = k(−r)D(u, r)−D(u, 0) as an element
of U1 for u ∈ Cd and r ∈ Γ. Let T be the subspace spanned by T (u, r) for
all u and r.

(2.2) Proposition

 (1) [T (v, s), T (u, r)] = (u, s)T (v, s) − (v, r)T (u, r) + T (w, r + s)
      where w = (v, r)u − (u, s)v and hence T is a Lie-subalgebra.

 (2) [D(v, 0), T (u, r)] = 0

 (3) V = ⊕Vr be weight space decomposition. Then each Vr is T -invariant

 (4) Each Vr is T -irreducible

 (5) Vr ∼
        = Vs as T -module.

Proof

(2) [D(v, 0), k(−r)D(u, r) − D(u, 0)]

                            = [D(v, 0), k(−r)D(u, r)]
                            = [D(v, 0), k(−r)]D(u, r)
                            + k(−r)[D(v, 0), D(u, r)]
                            = −(v, r)k(−r)D(u, r)
                            + (v, r)k(−r)D(u, r)
                            = 0.
(1) From (2) it follows that

               [T (v, s), T (u, r)] = [k(−s)D(v, s), k(−r)D(u, r)]

                                         9
       = [k(−s), k(−r)D(u, r)]D(v, s) + k(−s)[D(v, s), k(−r)D(u, r)]



                    = [k(−s), k(−r)]D(u, r)D(v, s)
                    + k(−r)[k(−s), D(u, r)]D(v, s)
                    + k(−s)[D(v, s), k(−r)]D(u, r)
                    + k(−s)k(−r)[D(v, s), D(u, r)]
                    = (u, s)k(−s)D(v, s)
                        −(v, r)k(−r)D(u, r)
                    + k(−s − r)D(w, r + s) where w = (v, r)u − (u, s)v
                    = (u, s)T (v, s)
                        −(v, r)T (u, r)
                    + T (w, r + s)
       where w = (v, r)u − (u, s)v

(3) From (2) it follows that T commutes with h and hence Vr is a T -module.
(4)   Let U = ⊕r∈Γ Ur where Ur = {v ∈ U | [D(u, 0), v] = (u, r)v for u ∈ Cd }.
Since V is A ⊕ DerA irreducible for v, w in Vr there exists X in U0 such that
                                                          P
Xv = w. This is due to weight reasons. Now X =               ai Xi where each Xi
                                                        P
is of the form k(−r)D(u0 , r1 ) · · · D(uk , rk ) where   ri = r. We are using
the fact that L acts trivially on V . Now using the fact that k(−s)D(u, r) =
D(u, r)k(s) − (u, s)D(u, r) and the fact that k(r)k(s) = k(r + s) we see that
each Xi is linear combination of elements of the form

               k(−r1 )D(u1, r1 )k(−r2 )D(u2 , r2 ) · · · k(−rk )D(uk , rk ).

This proves X ∈ U(T ), the universal enveloping algebra of T . Hence Vr is T
irreducible.
(5) First note that k(s − r)Vr ⊆ Vs . Repeating the same we see that

                    Vr = k(r − s)k(s − r)Vr ⊆ k(r − s)Vs ⊆ Vr .


                                            10
Thus Vr = k(r − s)Vs . Define f : Vr → Vs by f (v) = k(s − r)v which is
clearly injective and surjective. Now

                                f (T (u, k)v) = k(s − r)T (u, k)v
                                                 = T (u, k)k(s − r)v
                                                 = T (u, k)f (v)

Thus f is a T -homomorphism. This proves (5).

Let Ik be the linear span of Tk (u, r, m1 · · · mk ), u ∈ Cd for all r, m1 , m2 · · · mk ∈
Γ.

(2.4) Lemma (1) Tk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk ) = Tk (u, r, mσ(1) , · · · mσ(k) ) for any
permutation σ on k-letters.
(2) Tk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk ) = Tk−1 (u, r, m1, · · · mk−1 )−Tk−1 (u, r+mk , m1 , · · · mk−1 )
(3) Ik is an ideal of T .
(4) Ik ⊆ Ik−1 for k ≥ 2.
(5) [Ik , Iℓ ] ⊆ Ik+ℓ−1 for k, ℓ ≥ 1.

Proof (1) Follows from definition
(2) Collect all terms where mk does not occur in the sum of Tk and that can
be seen to be equal to Tk−1 (u, r, m1 , · · · mk−1 ). Sum of the rest of the terms
can be seen to equal to −Tk−1 (u, r + mk , m1 , · · · mk−1 ). This is because every
term contains mk

                                −(u, s)Tk (v, r + s, m1 , · · · mk ).

By applying Proposition 2.2 (1) write [T (v, s), Tk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk )] = A1 +
A2 + A3 . It is easy to see that A1 is the first term of the above formula.
Now in A2 look for the terms where (v, mi ) occurs and that can be seen as
a component of the third term of the above formula. Now in A2 the terms
where no mi occurs is equal to the second term of the above formula. The
rest of the formula can be seen in a similar way. This proves the claim. Now
note that the first term in the claim is zero. Clearly 2nd, 4th and 6th terms
are in Ik . Now 3rd and 5th term is equal to

                     b=0  b               b=0 b

The rest of the four terms are in Ik+ℓ−1 and this proves (5).

                                                    13
Proof To prove the Lemma, we first interpret Tk ’s as certain polynomials
in A = C[t±1         ±1                             d
          1 , · · · td ]. We fix a non-zero u in C . Let k be a positive integer
                                                          Y
and let m1 , m2 , · · · mk ∈ Γ. Let Pk (m1 , · · · mk ) =    (1 − tmi ). Recall
                                                                    1≤i≤k
 mi        (m )           (m )
t     =   t1 i 1   · · · td i d .   Let Jk be the ideal in A generated by Pk (m1 , · · · mk )
for all non-zero mi ’s ∈ Γ. Then clearly Jk+1 ⊆ Jk . It is easy to see that
Tk (u, r, m1, · · · mk ) can be identified with polynomial tr Pk (m1 , · · · mk ). Recall
that u is fixed.
      Thus it is sufficient to prove that,

Claim 1 Pk (m1 , · · · mk ) ∈
                            / Jk+1 . Suppose
                                  X
(∗)         Pk (m1 , · · · mk ) =      fℓ Pk+1(nℓ1 , nℓ2 , · · · nℓk+1 )

where fℓ ∈ A. Let Dti = ti dtdk . Now consider Dti1 · · · Dtik Pk+1 (n1 , · · · nk+1 )
and evaluate at (t1 , · · · td ) = (1, · · · 1). This can be seen to be zero as after
differentiating Pk+1 , k times, each component has at least one factor (tni −1).
We will now prove that there exists i1 , · · · ik such that

Claim 2 Dti1 · · · Dtik Pk (m1 , · · · mk ) |t=(1,...1) is non-zero. Thus ∗ can not
hold. This prove the claim 1. Now choose ℓ, 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ d such that S = {i |
(mi )ℓ 6= 0} is non-empty. Let #S = p and let i1 , · · · ip ∈ S. Consider
                                  Y      Y
   (Dtℓ )p Pk (m1 , · · · mk ) = µ (mi )ℓ (1 − tmj )tmi1 +mi2 +···+mip + Jk−s+1
                                          i∈S      j ∈S
                                                     /

which is not too difficult to see. Where µ is a non-negative integer. Repeat-
ing the process finitely many times (choosing different index ℓ1 6= ℓ). We
see that there exists i1 , · · · , ik such that Dti1 Dti2 · · · Dtik .Pk (m1 , · · · , mk ) =
λtm1 +···+mk + J1 where λ is non-zero integer. Now evaluating at t = (1, · · · 1)
we see that claim 2 is true.
      To see (2) first note that

                   (1 − tm )(1 − tn ) + (1 − tm+n ) = (1 − tm ) + (1 − tn ).

                                                   14
Thus

                                       i=2

This proves (2).
(3) is easy to check.

(2).                                         T = I1

In particular Ik is a co-finite ideal in T .

Proof First note that from Lemma 2.4(2) we have

              Tk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk ) = Tk (u, s, m1 · · · mk ) mod Ik+1

for all r, s ∈ Γ. Further

          −Tk (u, 0, m1, · · · mk ) = Tk (u, 0, −m1, m2 · · · mk ) mod Ik+1

which follows from above and Lemma 2.5 (3). Now from additive property of
Lemma 2.5(2) it follows that Ik /Ik+1 is spanned by Tk (u, 0, ei1 , · · · eik ) where
e1 , · · · ed is the standard basis. Thus (1) follows. (2) follows from definitions.
Now it is easy to conclude that Ik is a co-finite ideal for each k.



                                              15
3. Section

   We will explain the plan of the proof of Theorem (1.9). First we will
prove that T /I2 ∼
                 = gℓd (C). Then we will prove that if Ik , k ≥ 2 is zero on a
finite dimensional irreducible module V of T then I2 is zero on V . Thus V
is a module for T /I2 ∼= gℓd (C). Further we prove that any co-finite ideal J
of T contains Ik for large k. Thus any irreducible finite dimensional module
V of T is actually a module for T /I2 . From this it will be easy to conclude
Theorem 1.9 which will be explained at the end of the section.

(3.1) Proposition T /I2 ∼
                        = gℓd (C).

Proof First recall that F α (ψ, b) is a A ⊕ DerA-module and each weight
space V (ψ) ⊗ tm is a T -module. It is easy to verify that I2 acts trivially on
V (ψ) ⊗ tm . Now note that T (ei , ej )v(m) = Eji v(m) 6= 0 for some ψ. From
this we conclude that T (ei , ej ) is non-zero in T /I2 . Now it is easy to see that
T (u, s) + T (u, r) = T (u, r + s) mod I2 and hence T (ei , ej ) spans T /I2 . Define
π : T /I2 → gℓd (C).
                                π(T (ei , ej )) = Eji

Consider
                   X = [T (ei , ej ), T (ek , eℓ )]
                        = [k(−ej )D(ei , ej ), k(−eℓ )D(ek , eℓ )]
                        = −δiℓ k(−eℓ )D(ek , eℓ )
                            +δkj k(−ej )D(ei , ej )
                        − δkj k(−eℓ − ej )D(ei , eℓ + ej )
                            +δiℓ k(−eℓ − ej )D(ek , eℓ + ej ).
Follows from Proposition (2.2). Note that the following is true in T /I2 .

                  k(−eℓ − ej )D(es , eℓ + ej ) = k(−eℓ )D(es , eℓ )

                                          16
                              +k(−ej )D(es , ej ) − D(es , 0)

for s = i, k. Thus X = −δkj (k(−eℓ )D(ei , eℓ ) − D(ei , 0))


                           +δiℓ (k(−ej )D(ek , ej ) − D(ek , 0))

                             = −δkj T (ei , eℓ ) + δiℓ T (ek , ej ).

Thus π defines a surjective homomorphism. As T (u, 0) is zero it follows
that T (ei , ej ) span T /I2 which proves dim (T /I2 ) ≤ d2 . Thus π defines an
isomorphism.

(3.2)     Lemma (Yuly Billig) Suppose G is a Lie- algebra over C and J is
an ideal with spanning set Jα , α ∈ B. Suppose there exists an element I in
G such that [I, Jα ] = λJα , λ 6= 0 for all α ∈ B. then J acts trivially on any
irreducible finite dimensional module V of G.

Proof Since the base field is complex numbers and V is finite dimensional,
I has eigen vectors. Let λ1 , · · · , λk be all the eigen values of I on V . Choose
λi such that λ + λi is not an eigenvalue. Let v be eigenvector with eigenvalue
λi for I. Consider IJα v = Jα Iv + [I, Jα ]v = (λi + λ)Jα v. This proves
Jα v = 0 ∀α ∈ B. Let W = {w ∈ V | Jα w = 0 ∀α ∈ B}. Since J is an ideal,
it is easy to see that W is a G-module. But W 6= 0. Since V is irreducible
W = V which proves that J acts trivially on V .

(3.3)      Proposition Suppose V is irreducible finite dimensional module
for T such that Ik+1 acts trivially on V . Then I2 acts trivially on V .

Proof From the proof of Lemma 2.4(3) we have

        [T (v, s), Tk (u, r, m1, · · · mk ) = −(v, r)Tk+1 (u, r, m1, · · · mk , s)
                                        X

                                               17
              P
Let I =           T (ei , ei ) and note that I is actually identity element in T /I2 ∼
                                                                                     =
gℓd(C). Thus I is non-zero on T /Ik+1 for k ≥ 1.

                         X
                     +         (mi )j Tk (u, r + mi , m1 , · · · m
                                                                 ci , · · · mk , ej ).
                         i,j

Now we use Lemma 2.5(2) and the following facts.

 (1) Tk is linear in u

 (2) Tk (u, r + m, m1 , · · · mk ) = Tk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk ) mod Ik+1 (by lemma
         2.4(2)).

 (3) Ik+1 is zero on V .

From that we conclude that

       [I, Tk (u, r, m1, · · · mk )] = −Tk (u, r, m1, · · · mk ) + kTk (u, r, m1 , · · · mk )

which proves the claim. Now we can use Lemma (3.2) for the ideal Ik . Thus
Ik is zero on V . Repeating this argument we conclude that I2 acts trivially
on V . This argument breaks down for k = 1 as we cannot apply the Lemma
3.2.

(3.4)         Proposition Any co-finite ideal J of T contains Ik for large k.




                                                     18
Proof Claim J ∩ Ik is co-finite in T for all k. For that consider ϕ : T 7→
T /J ⊕ T /Ik
                                              v 7→ (v, v).
Clearly ker ϕ = J ∩ Ik and T /J ∩ Ik is a subalgebra of finite dimensional
Lie-algebra T /J ⊕ T /Ik . This proves the claim.
   Consider
            ϕ1                       ϕ2
Ik /J ∩ Ik ֒→ Ik−1 /J ∩ Ik → Ik−1/J ∩ Ik−1 where ϕ1 is injective and ϕ2 is
surjective. Let ρk = ϕ2 ◦ ϕ1 . Thus ρk : Ik /Ik ∩ J → Ik−1 /J ∩ Ik−1 . Clearly ρk
in injective. Let tn = dim In /In ∩ J and note that tn+1 ≤ tn . Thus {tn }n∈Z+
is a decreasing sequence of non-negative integers. Therefore tk = s for some
s and for large k > N.
   First we note the following two statements for a fixed i.

 (1) For ℓ 6= i

                 [T (eℓ , −eℓ ), Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk )] = −kℓ Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk )

      where kℓ is the number of eℓ that occur in Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ).
                                                P
 (2) Suppose the ideal J contains                   am,I Tm (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejm ) where the num-
      ber of ei ’s that occur in Tm (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejm ) is same for all m where
      I = {j1 , · · · jk }. Then J contains Tm (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejm ) for m ∋ am,I 6= 0.

(1) Follows from the proof of lemma 2.4(3). (2) follows from (1). We will
prove the Proposition assuming d ≥ 3 to avoid some computations. For a
fixed i, consider the following set

                       S = {Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ) | jℓ 6= i for all ℓ}.

Now choose k ∋ #S > s and k > N. Thus S is linearly dependent mod
Ik ∩ J. Thus there exists non-zero scalars aI (I = {j1 , · · · jk }) such that
                          X
                    X=       aI Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ) ∈ J.

                                                    19
Now using (2) we conclude that

                               Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ) ∈ J for some I.

For m, n 6= i consider

  [T (em , en ), Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk )] = ℓδji m Tk (ei , em , ej1 , · · · ebji , · · · ejk , en ) ∈ J.

Now Tk (ei , em , ej1 , · · · ebji , · · · ejk , en ) = Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · b
                                                                                eji , · · · ejk , en )

                                 −Tk+1 (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · eji , · · · ejk , en ).

Now by (2) it follows that

                                Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · b
                                                        eji , · · · ejk , en ) ∈ J.

Now repeating this process we see that

(∗)                                     Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ) ∈ J

for all possible indices j1 , · · · jk which are all different from i. Applying
T (ei , ei ) to the above vector to conclude

                                        Tk (ei , ei , ej1 , · · · ejk ) ∈ J


(∗∗)                       Tk (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk ) − Tk (ei , ei , ej1 , · · · ejk )

                                 = −Tk+1 (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk , ei ) ∈ J.

Fix j 6= i. Replacing k by k + 1, consider the following vector which is in J
by (∗).

[T (ej , ei ), Tk+1(ei , 0, ej1 , · · · , ejk+1 )] = P δjjℓ Tk+1 (ei , ej , ej1 , · · · b
                                                                                        ejℓ , · · · ejk+1 , ei )

                                      −Tk+1 (ej , ei , ej1 , · · · ejk+1 ).

                                                        20
Now Tk+1 (ei , ej , ej1 , · · · ebjℓ , · · · ejk+1 , ei )


     = Tk+1 (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · b
                                 ejℓ , · · · ejk+1 , ei ) − Tk+2 (ei , 0, ej1 , · · · ej , · · · ejk+1 , ei ).
Now by (∗∗) both vectors are in J. Thus we conclude that

                                    Tk+1 (ej , ei , ej1 , · · · ejk+1 ) ∈ J.

Now by (2) we see that

                                    Tk+1 (ej , 0, ej1 , · · · ejk+1 ) ∈ J.

This is true for all possible indices j1 , · · · jk+1 which are all different from i.
     Now applying T (ejℓ , ei ) for jℓ 6= j we see that

                            Tk+1 (ej , ejℓ , ej1 , · · · b
                                                         ejℓ , · · · ejk+1 , ei ) ∈ J.

     Now by (2) we see that

                            Tk+1 (ej , 0, ej1 , · · · , b
                                                        ejℓ , · · · ejk+1 , ei ) ∈ J.

Repeating this process we see that Tk+1 (ej , 0, eℓ1 , · · · eℓk+1 ) ∈ J for all possible
ℓ1 , · · · ℓk+1.
     Now using the technique in the proof of Lemma 2.5 we see that

                         Tk+1 (ej , 0, m1 , · · · mk+1 ) ∈ J for all mi ∈ Γ

Now replasing k + 1 by k + 2 we see that

Tk+2 (ej , 0, m1 , · · · mk+2 ) = Tk+1 (ej , 0, m1 , · · · mk+1 )−Tk+1 (ej , mk+2 , m1 , · · · , mk+1 ) ∈ J.

Then it follows that

                                Tk+1 (ej , mk+2 , m1 , · · · mk+1 ) ∈ J.

Strictly speaking we have it for non-negative coefficients. But the other cases
can be handled similarly. This proves Ik+1 ⊆ J and the Proposition. Further
s = 0.

                                                       21
Proof of Theorem (1.9) . Let V be a module as in Theorem. Let
V = ⊕r∈Γ Vr be the weight space decomposition where

              Vr = {v ∈ V | D(u, 0)v = (u, r + α)v, ∀u ∈ Cd }.

We know that Vr ∼
                = Vs as T -modules from Proposition 2.2(5). This with
Proposition (3.3), Proposition (3.4) combined with the fact that some co-
finite ideal of T acts trivially on Vr tells us that all Vr′ s are isomorphic to
some V (ψ, b) as gℓd-modules. Note that the isomorphism between Vr′ s is given
by k(r) (from proof of proposition 2.2(5)). Thus if we let Vr = V (ψ, b) ⊗ tr
we see that k(r)v(s) = v(s + r) for v in V (ψ, b).
   Now consider T (u, r) in T /I2 and note that it is linear in both variables.
   Thus                               X
                     T (u, r)v(s) =          ui rj T (ei , ej )v(s)
                                      i,j
                                      X
                                  =          ui rj Eji v(s)
                                       i,j
                                            P
Therefore k(−r)D(u, r)v(s) = D(u, 0)v(s) + ( ui vj Eji v)(s)

                                         X
                     = (u, s + α)v(s) + (  uirj Eji v)(s).

Multiply both sides by k(r) we get

                    D(u, r)v(s) = (u, s + α)v(s + r)
                                   X
                                + ( ui rj Eji v)(s + r).
                                        ij


This completes the proof of the theorem.
